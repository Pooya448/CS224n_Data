(cracking up) nope, you lost me.

(ross lies on the floor.)
I will be monica.

(he jumps down and cuddles up with ross.)
(pause) sorry.
(raises his hand in shame.)
i do not know, but it smells good.
(he gets up and heads for the door only to stop short and start laughing.)
nothing.
oh yeah, and she is really nice too!
she taught me about y’know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
you are still a tiny bit on fire there!
(leaving central perk and seeing monica laying on top of rachel who is moaning in pain.)
oh my.

(to dina) you were right.

(bobby gets happy.)
dude, that is not a compliment!
so whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
what are you going to do?
you are going to have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?!
you can not be a single mother alone!
you are going to ruin your life!

it is different for you.
you are so strong and together.
you are not some dumb kid who does not know what she is doing.
one pregnant woman at a time, please!
i just want you to be okay.

(to bobby) well!
well…so-so uh, what kind of music does numb nuts—oh forget it!

‘because… ‘because you are my baby sister!
well I would be scared of them, but all right.
of course he is going to have his uncle joey!
that is right!

(hugs dina and bobby looks to hug rachel.)
what?
eyes!
no, no.
your eyes!
no.
chandler’s eyes!
feminine.
(entering) ahoy!
great!
I am finally getting into this sailing stuff.
why would i do that?
it took three guys to get the thing in there!
oh, it is great!
it is a great place to just kind of, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
(he says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)
you could?
(drinking a beer) look at this clown!
just because he is got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
(yelling) get out of the way jackass!
(to rachel) who names his boat coast guard anyway?
what are they doing out here?
the coast’s all the way over there.
(points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
all right.
come on rach, not again.
i got it!
okay?
let us start sailing, and i want to go over there (points) where that boatload of girls is!
(yelling to them) yo-ho-ho!
uh, boat rope.
uhh, rub it?
I would say, come again.
no-no, wait i-i-i know this one, i know this one, uh… and deaf!
yes.
i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler.
(entering) hey.
i do not want to talk about it.
y’know, you could have at least saved me a whole cookie.
(he grabs what is left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)
(recoils in horror) women are mean!!!
(storms out.)
(entering) hey.
oh uh, i do not know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
because!
you are mean on the boat!
well, lesson learned!
rachel is mean!
does a good teacher say, "put down the beer pinhead!?"
six and a half!
you knocked that last one out of my hand!
remember?
well it hit me anyway!
and it would have hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer.
you will not boss me around anymore?
and you will be nice?
and you will be topless?
do you want me to learn?!
ohh yeah.
nope.
i do not know why you just do not say left.
huh?
(hurrying over) okay!
okay, you are yelling again!
see that?
oh, y’know what?
since I am here, i think I am going to have me a little beer on the port side.
(grabs and opens one.)
uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff i did not know there.
oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth.
did you see it?
it was gross!
all right that is it!
you are yelling and i do not see you taking your top off!
i quit!
why not?!

I am a tribbiani!
and tribbianis quit!

well, hey i did learn.
yeah!
come on.
yeah, it is okay.
i know what a mainsail is.
(points to it.
it is the larger sail.)
i know, i know to duck when the boom comes across.
i-i know port is right.
damnit!
yeah, yeah.
hey, why do not you give a pull on that rope?
(points.)
just pull on it.

thank you.
what are you doing?
what you—do not hold it like that!
you are lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.

you are wasting good pastrami!
(gasps.)
oh my god!

(entering with phoebe) hey!
we know its ross!
I am going to be an uncle!
come here!
(he joins the hug.)
well that, that sounds good.
bye.
what secrets?
(whispering to chandler) you will tell me later?
y’know, monica and chandler are married.
ross and rachel are having a baby.
maybe you and i should do something.
i do not have a key, they took mine to give to you.
why would they take away our keys?
no that is not it.
they let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
hey, i washed those!
yeah that did not sound like me.
yeah, i have stuff in there too.
monica’s chicken parm!
I will take care of it.
(he picks up the phone) hey mr. treeger, it is joey tribbiani.
listen, i need to get into monica and chandler’s apartment.
it is an emergency.
(listens) uhh, gas leak!
yeah oh, and bring garlic bread.
(hangs up.)
yeah, it seemed pretty important.
really?
yeah, i do not think that is what it is.
oh wow, i do not feel well.
please, just-just, just go and talk to rachel.
i still can not believe they took away my key.
you trust me with yours.
what the hell is that?
whoa!
whoa!
whoa!
treeger, what are you doing?
(eating) huh.

(goes and does so.)
so it is noticeable huh?
(simultaneously) oh my god!!!
i can not believe that!!
how are you doing?
well, what did you say to her?
(shocked) what?
whoa!
hey!
whoa!!
hold up!

so like 3% of the time they do not even work?!
huh?
they should put that on the box!

(grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
hey monica it is joey.
listen uh, phoebe and i smell gas comin’ from your apartment.
yeah and we would go check it out, but you took away our keys.
how?
i guess i could break down your door.
and-and you will not blame us for any damage?
(gives phoebe a thumbs up.)
uh, okay I will-I will-I will break it down.
(he hands the phone to phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)
hey!
i do not see the baby.
where is it?
hey.
(he exits) hey!
great, you are home!
guess what phoebe got me for christmas!
(starts drumming.)
(yelling) no!
drums!
hey-hey, pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.
(to rachel) ready?
one, two, three, four... thank you.
(he gets up and puts on his jacket.)
(phoebe enters) hey pheebs!
here.
(gives her the coins) now i only owe you $49.50.
what is rock 'n' roll about that?
oh wait, before you tell me what it is!
(he plays a drum-roll) okay, what is it?
is it on me?
i feel, i feel like it is on me!
i got, hey!
(he storms into his room) (entering wearing a superman costume) merry christmas!
(yelling from the bedroom) is it back in the cage?
cage closed?
uh, ah, monica's pregnant?!
oh, that is cool.
we have interns at 'days of our lives'.
(entering) hey!
where is chandler?
i want to wish him good luck on his first day.
(monica smiles) ... and i smelled bacon.
(taking some) (puzzled) who did?
(monica looks bewildered) (standing up, surprised) she did?
(still surprised) i did?
i do not know, but it sounds great.
with lennart haze?
oh my god, that is great!
that is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
well, it must be, because i read and i did not understand a singe word.
yeah, yeah, and directing.
yeah, he is done some amazing works.
(almost laughing) i know.
when the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
(they all laugh) (sitting down) do not make me more nervous than i already am!
it is so amazing to meet you.
(they are shaking hands) I am such a big fan of your work.
tell me about it!
"unlimited nights and weekends!"
no, i-i-i was not making fun of you, honestly, i-i think you were great in those commercials.
yeah.
(regaining confidence) are you kiddin'?
when they shoot you out of that cannon… wow!
oh, yah, sure.
err, "i think you know".
"i am what you made me.
you know what?
i could go right now."
"i can not.
oh, i want to, long pause, but i can not."
(understandingly) oh, oh, i thought that was your character's name, you know, i thought you were like an indian or something, you know with a… (he mimes wearing a feather on his head) ah, y-y-you are sure you do not want me to do it again?
i could do it with an accent, you know, southern (he speaks in what he believes is a southern accent) "i could go right now, maaan!"
(interrupting their conversation) ah, hi, ah.
thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what i did wrong, I would just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you.
and, and also: (to producer #1) 'how you doing?'
(to lennart again) you should, please, just give me another chance.
i really want to get better, please.
yeah.
i really doubt that.
(suggesting) could not i just sleep with the producer?
well, they want to see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, lennart haze did not like me.
(he sits down) well, he said i was not urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical.
oh, and he said that i should think less.
wooooooooow (he takes the sneaker) it is like they are on fire!
(determined) i give you $ 500 for them!
hey, that would work on me!
why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords?
(entering) i know, I am sorry, but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
but I am bursting with you-hu!
actually, i really need… yes… ahahaaa (he seems to be in pain) (walking on the spot) "i think you know!"
"i am what you made me!
you know what?"
"i could go right now."
(urgent) "i, oh, i can not.
i want to, but i can not!"
(disbelieving) i did?
sure, yeah.
i do not have time to say thank you because i really got to go.
(he grabs his jacket and limps out of the room) (entering) hey!
probably want to know what I am doing…?
yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor.
i got a call-back, so I am drinking everything.
oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
we got to get more of that.
(he leaves the apartment) (hoping frantically on the spot, screaming) "i need an answer!"
"you know!"
"i need an answer now!"
(screaming) oh!
"you knew this all along and you never told me?
you never told me?
i can never forgive you, i can never forgive myself, i have nothing to live for – bang – end scene!"
(in pain) oh thanks, thanks!
now, i really have to get… all right!
here we go!
1999!
the year of joey!
what is the matter?!
all right, I will take care of it.
ross!
ross!
ross, listen!
who are you kissing at midnight, huh?
rachel or phoebe?
well you got to kiss someone, you can not kiss your sister.
chandler.
dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or chandler?
yeah.
okay, great!
pheebs!
pheebs!
ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
rach!
rach!
listen, I am going to kiss you at midnight.
so?
who would you rather have kiss you, me or chandler?
yeah!
so did that do anything for ya?
all right, my new year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
well, y'know those special skills i have listed on my resume?
i would love it would be great if one of those was true.
really?
who-who have you taught?
yeah that would be great!
thanks pheebs!
nice!!
yeah!
is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
you all right chandler?
is there something funny about that name?
oh really!
where?
somewhere funny I would bet!
(chandler is straining to keep quiet as phoebe enters.)
see ya!
all right pheebs, i am ready for my first lesson.
umm, okay.
hey, pheebs!
check-check this out.
(holds up his hand in one of phoebe's chords.)
yeah listen so, i thought i was getting better, so on my way home today i stopped by this guitar store and… no.
yes!
yeah!
(chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
you look like a freak.
well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
(does a chord and monica starts taking pictures of him and phoebe.
they both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that monica takes.)
yes!
yes, i did.
(thinks) (quietly) g-sharp.
what?!
i did not touch a guitar!
no, I am not questioning it, I am saying it is stupid!
(notices monica standing between them and smiling.)
what?!
(the camera clicks, taking another picture.)
your other student, was you!
(looking in the yellow pages) look, maybe i need to try a real teacher!
right here!
here!
andy cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there is a nice picture of him with a little kid and the kid's got a guitar!!!!!!
(storms out.)
(answering phone) hello?
uhh, chandler's not here.
okay.
nice!
oh.
that is quite a situation.
uh, do you see any like, powder?
good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it will absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
umm, do you see any—oh, vaseline?
yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
ross?
you okay?
really?!
uhh, what color is it?
well, I am just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she will not know the difference!
(to ross) uh, rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
(he hangs up the phone and strands ross in the bathroom.)
oh well, you are timing could not be better.
i am putting out fires all over the place.
what-what is it, what is it?
oh no, no-no-no-no!
i do not want to know!
i do not care, rach!
look, i am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can not tell anyone!
and you are not supposed to be gossiping!!
I am not listening to you!
hey, pheebs?
look, pheebs, i just, i want to apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again.
and-and i promise, i will not touch a guitar until you say I am ready.
(after a short pause she hands him her guitar.)
you really think I am ready?
wow!
cool!
(he takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note.
however, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor.
phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
(sitting back down) was the chord at least right… how do you partner!
umm?
oh, no!
(starts that screaming thing again.
rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)
well, then it would not be a secret.
so yeah, that would be okay.
yeah.
yeah!
now?
you want me to go over there now?
do you know something?
i might know something.
what is the thing you know?
i can not tell you what i know.
okay, fine.
you do not know!
(gasps) you know!!!!
yeah, i know!!!!
too long!
oh my god, rach, I have been dying to talk to someone about this for so long!
listen, listen, we can not say anything about this to anybody, they are so weird about that!
listen… (phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
oh, i am going to go for a walk in the rain.
(joining in, in his sleep) joey.
joey.
joey.
joey!
joey!!
(proudly) oh, you should here me.
look, i told ya, I am not going to any clinic!
i do not have a problem, you are the one with the problem!
you should go to a "quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
yeah, they do!
quit being a baby and leave me alone!
there, you have just had your first class!
ohhh, yeah!
i got to do what i got to do, you got to do what you got to do, you just do it.
that is not whipped!
whipped is wh-tcssh!
you can not do anything!
this sucks!
i did not know i had to stay up all night before i went to this stupid sleep clinic!
I am so tired!
yeah, well… yeah, rach, i think you are handling that really well.
i am… (looks in his date book.)
free!
(still looking in date book) hey!
that is the day after i stop menstruating!
(they all look at him.)
this is not mine.
joey tribbiani.
(sleepily) yeah, she is.
wow!
(falls back asleep, loudly) how you doing?
what?!
(asleep) so why do not you give me your number?
(muffled by the mouth guard) hey you guys!
what is happening?
(muffled) oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it is going to help me not to snore.
(takes out the mouth guard) i know i do not have too!
it tastes good.
(puts it back in.)
(muffled by the mouth guard) dude!
i am trying to sleep!
(shrugs to say, "what is up with that?")
(lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode) okay, so we went to the beach, because phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and i do not really know what happened with that.
(voice-over) oh, and then monica joked that she would not go out with a guy like chandler... (voice-over) ...and he could not let it go, and... i do not really know what happened with that either.
(voice-over) oh-oh!
and then ross’s new girlfriend, bonnie, shows up and rachel convinced her to save her head.
and then ross and rachel kiss, and now ross has to choose between rachel and the bald girl and i do not know what happened there either... y'know what, hold on, let me go get chandler.
(gets up and leaves.)
whoa, wait, pheebs, wait a second!
do not you want to stay here and talk about it?
(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) hey, you guys!
take a look at this!
(chandler and monica jump up and go over to the hole.)
check this baby out, dug me a hole!
oh no!
no!!
my hole!!
(climbing out of the hole) what?!
what?!!
what is it?!
yeah, and I am a little tired from digging the hole.
well, there is really only one thing you can do.
you are going to have to pee on it.
do not blame me, i saw it on the discovery channel.
if you want some privacy you can use my hole.
me too.
no?
sure, it is hard to forget!
but that does not mean you have to talk about it!
a lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to chandler) ever talk about.
it is between us and the sea, ross!
nope.
all right.
(gets up) well, we have to say something!
we have to get it out!
it is eating me alive!!
monica got stung by a jellyfish.
and i was tired from digging the huge hole!
I would seen this thing on the discovery channel... that is right i stepped up!
she is my friend and she needed help!
and if i had too, I would pee on anyone of you!
only, uhh, i could not.
i got the stage fright.
i wanted to help, but there was too much pressure.
so-so i uh, i turned to chandler.
(laughs) that is ‘because sometimes i just do it through my wall to freak you out.
yeah, they are mine.
i do not know uhh… (pause as he thinks about it.)
well, I am joey.
yeah, I am disgusting, i take my underwear off in other people's homes.
(reluctantly taking them) chandler?
a word.
that is it!
I am tired of covering for you two!
this has got to stop!
(realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.)
ahh!
(throws them towards chandler's room.)
and tighty-whiteys!
what are you, 8?
oh hey, no, you are not welcome.
okay, look, i hate this!
you guys keep embarrassing me!
(to monica) yesterday, rachel found your razor in our bathroom and i did not know what to say, so i said it was mine and-and that i was playing a woman in a play.
and one thing led to another and (he puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
yeah, it was!
all right, listen, i can not… oh-oh, yeah-yeah, i bet all the sex makes it easier!
all right!
but, (to monica) you do it with me once.
did not think so.
hey, pheebs!
what is wrong buddy?
I am surprised you did not go home wearing your lunch.
so you uh, still wondering?
you are smart.
i like that.
oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
hiya.
I am joey.
i mean, I am disgusting.
i make low-budget adult films.
(points at chandler, angrily.)
you guys promised you would be more careful!
i mean, come on!
the good joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
well, I am telling everyone about you!
that is the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that does not make me look like a pig!
yeah, i like that.
but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place?
well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
all right.
hey, but it better make me look really, really good.
(starts for his room.)
oh, and another thing, the video camera?
nice!!
oh no-no-no!
no-no-no-no-no-no-no!
no!
i am not a pervert!
okay?
it is just… i just… kind of… thank you!
what?!!
(he turns around and stares at chandler who is silently pleading with joey to go along with it.)
no I am not!!
no!
no!
i am not a sex addict!
no it is not!
no, it is not.
because you can also explain it with the truth!
(thinking) i slept with monica.
uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in london.
of course it is true!
how else would you explain all the weird stuff that is been going on?
ahh—oy!
that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london.
right monica?
no!
if anyone's a sex addict here, it is monica!
yeah.
yeah.
she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!
that makes sense!
uhh, monica?
but sadly i could not be enticed.
well, i think we have all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not.
eh?
all right, now, I am going to get back to my bucket.
I am only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
(offers it to everyone.)
well that thing is clearing in the way!
all right.
ah-ha!
(he grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.)
ah-ah!!
damn fridge!
great!
roomie!
yeah!
well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken.
we have to get a new one.
now, i checked around and your half is $400.
thanks a lot.
look rach, my parents bought this fridge just after i was born, okay?
now, i have never had a problem with it.
then you show up and it breaks!
what does that tell ya’?
all right, now you know that the atm will only let us you take out 300 at a time, I will take a check for the other hundred.
of course I am jokin’!
i do not take checks.
oh, I am sorry.
thank you chandler.
ooh!
so close.
hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break.
ross, seriously, how is it going with her?
huh.
the fridge broke.
i have to eat everything.
cold cuts, ice cream, limes—hey, what was in that brown jar?
not anymore.
so anyway, how do you want to pay me?
no!
no!
no!
for my new fridge—our new fridge!
so what?
look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
and i got custody of the kid, right?
now suppose the kid dies and-and i got to buy a new kid.
(pause) give me $400!
or!
you can just, y’know… (he walks up close to whisper in ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes ross into the fridge.)
what?
what the hell am i doing?
you just broke my fridge!
oh-ho-ho, you think i do not know what breaks my fridge?
excuse me!
(he opens the door and feels inside.)
well what do you know!
broken!
that will be $400!
(pause) you pushed him!
all right.
chandler, do you remember how i told you about our fridge?
i still have not gotten a check for your half yet.
I am not talking to you!
you broke my fridge!
(entering) pheebs!
there you are!
okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
really?!
call it even?
man, she is going to have a great time!
is she staying at the hotel corona?
sure!
i was there!
spring break ’81!
woo-hoo!
so what?
i drove down, sold t-shirts, had a blast.
and y’know who knows how to party?
drunk college chicks.
(entering) hey!
i just got this really weird message from ross.
he said turn on mtv.
ahh, to be 13 again.
do we have to know about that?
I am going to be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
(to the screen) shoot!
shoot!
shoot!
shoot, or just fall down.
that is good too.
oh, yeah.
hey, listen, lady....(sees that she is pregnant)...whoa.
oh yeah?
and who do you like?
the celtics?
ha.
they could not hit a boat if...wait.
they suck, alright?
wha?
wha..aa?
let me get the father.
hey, we need a father over here!
we need a father!
oh, oh, oh, sorry.
oh, uh, ok. right this way.
all the other pregnant women seem to be going in here.
tribbiani.
(takes phone) hi, yeah, it is me.
(listens) oh, no no no, we are just friends.
(listens) yeah, I am single.
(listens) 25.
(listens) an actor.
(listens) hello?
yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what is the deal with this father guy, i mean, if someone was having my baby somewhere, I would want to know about it, you know?
ok, look, maybe i should just go.
good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
you know what the celtics problem is?
they let the players run the team.
oh, it is.
it is.
ew!
what is that?
something exploded!
(panicked) water breaking, what do you mean?
what is that, water breaking?
come on, lydia, you can do it.
push!
push  them out, push  them out, harder, harder.
push  them out, push  them out, way out!
let us get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.
let us— (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) i was just—yeah, right.
push!
push!
oh, just had a baby.
relax.
you are only at nine centimeters.
and the baby's at zero station.
ben, ben, hey ben.
nothing.
i do not think that is his name.
he does not do much, does he?
i call it!!
does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
so, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
well then let me do it!
no-no-no!
look, I have been thinking about it.
I am an actor right?
so i will not get nervous talking in front of people.
no-no-no-no look no!
i will not spit, and i will not stare at monica’s breasts!
y’know?
everyone knows I am an ass man!
yeah and the most important thing is that it will not be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
it will be me!
and i swear I will do a really good job.
plus, y’know i love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
so i can do it?
all right!!!
okay!!
all right!
okay-okay, i got to get started on my speech!
oh, wait a minute, internet ministers can still have sex right?
okay.
oh!
my head!
oh!
(he is sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for monica to rub.)
oh!
(entering) hey!
say hello to reverend joey tribbiani!
(holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)
yeah, i just got off the internet!
man, there is a lot of porn out there!
anyway, i started working on what I am going to say for the ceremony, do you want to hear it?
now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (starts to read the piece of paper he brought.)
"we are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that monica and chandler share."
(monica and chandler like it so far.)
eh?
(he continues reading.)
"it is a love based on giving and receiving.
as well as having and sharing.
and the love that they give and have is shared and received.
and through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."
(phoebe nods her approval.)
"we too can share and love and have and receive."
okay you guys, i got a little more written.
are you ready?
(reading) "when i think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, i can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…" and then i can not think of a good word for right here.
(he points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)
yes!
ooh, like the time you and i went to atlantic city and i made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?!
remember?
oh.
okay.
ooh!
ooh!
okay, maybe I will talk about london!
y’know when you two hooked up!
only, only i will not say hooked up.
I will say, "began their beautiful journey…" "…by doing it."
okay.
all right.
umm, so uh, so how did it happen?
did your eyes meet across the room?
and then the next thing y’know you are in the bathtub together and she is feeding you strawberries?
yeah!!
i call that london style.
oh.
yeah baby!
oh.
yeah baby!
hey!
oh, dude I am so sorry!
hey no-no-no-no!
it is cool!
it is cool!
i-I will only be a second, I am still with my bride’s maid, i just—where are those condoms you brought?
ah.
(joey walks to chandler’s bag by getting as far away from chandler’s bed as possible.)
(pause) for just you?
hey listen, why do not you come downstairs with me?
there is some really nice girls down there.
all right, here you go buddy.
(he tosses him one.)
go nuts.
(exits.)
that is what that was?!
‘because that other thing?
i thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
oh… (to chandler) can you imagine if i had not left you that last one?
you two might have never gotten together.
ooh-ooh!
could you imagine if i sent that hooker up to the room like i was going to?!
it is like it was in the stars!
yeah baby!
(chandler glares at him.)
no baby!
and it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(shuts up on monica’s glare.)
hey!
(monica turns and looks at him) now I am a man of the cloth, but i still have feelings!
what?!
that is not fair!
it is not my fault!
i was off with my bride’s maid!
and who is to say i would have even said yes?!
(to monica) i mean i would have said yes.
chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right?
look, everything worked out okay!
this is crazy.
hey.
chandler, come on nothing even happened!
no-hey-no!
if you do not want me to do it, i except that.
i do not care about that.
i just…i do not want you to be upset.
yeah for like a half an hour one night!
chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life!
you are so lucky!
look what i missed out on by not being there!
although you know what?
it could never have worked like you guys did, ‘because you guys are perfect for each other.
y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits.
y’know?
and you just know it is going to last forever.
what?
really?
i can do it?
hey!
(they hug.)
well i do not know remember exactly but, it is-it is pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
hey!
so are guys doing okay?
ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!
here you go.
good for you!
hey, so, uh, how is it going living over at ross’?
bye.
there is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
thanks.
but maybe later.
you know what i want?
i want a lot of things!
i want to be with the woman i love on valentine’s day!
and i want her to love me back!
and i want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that is never going to happen!
oh, okay.
no, I am not sleeping with your friend jane again.
hey!
a dog!
hi!
who, you got to admit, looks a lot like jane.
thanks so much, pheebs!
(to the dog) we are going to have so much fun, yes we are!
(the dog sticks his head between joey’s legs) oh!
not that kind of fun.
get the ball, ready?
get the ball, get the ball!
(joey pretends to throw it, but really does not, and the dog goes running off.)
well, you are cute, but you are not too smart!
(looking at the ball the dog brought back) did i just throw this?
hi.
oh, that is, uh, that is phoebe’s friend’s dog.
i do not know what his real name is, but i call him mozzarella.
(to the dog) c’mere.
hey.
c’mere.
that is rachel.
she is the one who used to live here.
might as well be honest with you—we love her.
but we can not have her.
i really miss her.
well, hey, you understand, right?
you are a guy.
(thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) well, you used to be.
so, between her and me being friends, and her history with ross, it just is not going to happen.
it would be like you falling in love with a cat.
hey.
no.
yeah, sure.
go ahead.
(pause) oh, me, right!
nothing.
we just talked about stuff.
rachel stuff.
he is breathing!
no, no, no, no!
he is fine!
look, look, look!
(picks up the ball) here is your ball!
get your ball!
get your ball!
(he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) get your ball!
my god, what have i done to you, huh?
i broke the dog!
pheebs, i broke the dog!
hey, what is up?
oh, man, I am sorry.
why?
still, that really sucks, man.
especially on valentine’s day.
sort of.
you do not have to seem so happy about it.
oh, i…i d— forget about it.
it is no big deal.
it is nothing.
okay, uh…sit down.
(they do) um… there is this woman that i like.
a lot.
but, uh…it can not happen.
no!
yes.
sometimes i think maybe she could.
but it does not matter, because i can not do anything about it.
well, it is complicated.
she is with this other guy.
for a long time.
someone from work, too.
and i could never do that to the guy, because we are really good friends.
no.
i do not think so.
yeah, he is the best.
oh, i do not know.
i do!
so much!
i can not stop thinking about her!
i can not sleep, i— oh, yeah.
it is rachel.
(from bedroom) whoaa!!
hey.
no, i got to wear this thing for a couple weeks.
(points to the sling he is wearing) nooo.
i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out.
what is this?
fruit?
whoa, jam!
i love jam!
(to chandler) hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
this will just be my batch.
remember when you where a kid and your mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
(with food in his mouth) you talked to him.
are you crazy?
(with his mouthful) hey, i did not stalk her.
i mean (he sprays phoebe with crumbs) aww.
(tastes it) ohh!
put your hands together.
no more jam?!
check it out!!
jam crackers!
yeah, the knicks rule!
let me see.
(goes over and looks at the form) oh, right.
well, right after i did that sex study down at nyu.
(to chandler) hey, remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?
noooo, that is what i was wearing when i donated.
I am kind of surprised there is any of my boys left.
maybe, i should call this place and get them to put my 'days of our lives' on here.
you know, juice this puppy up a little.
orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
hey.
where you going?
sperm or regular?
so you are really doing this, huh?
sounds nice.
no kiddin', hmm.
no, i-i figured you would have picked a blond guy.
i do not know, i just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... hoyt.
it is a name, yeah.
i saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
he is got the body for it.
you guys have one of those signs that says: 'we do not swim in your toilet, so do not pee in our pool.
', you know.
sure you do, it was a gift from me.
oh!
and you have these three great kids.
yeah!
sure!
(monica gets very depressed) but hey, you know this way sounds good too.
oh monica.
(goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.)
wow, this guy's an astronaut.
that would have been cool, (sees monica) for like a day.
(hugs her again).
i called the sperm bank today, they have not sold a single unit of tribianni.
nobody wants my product.
i mean, i-i-i do not get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.)
maybe if they met me in person.
(wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) did i get it?
okay, ross, i realise that you did not expect to walk in and see that, but.. let me explain, okay?
rach, he just saw us.
but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay?
one kiss.
look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.. yeah, but it did happen, so... ross?
no, no, no!
probably.
no, no!
really?
ross.. look, do not you think that will be a little weird?
i do like fajitas.
ah, can i just say i know we are doing this for ross, and that is cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we would be doing on our first date.
I would take you out for a romantic night.
some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home... in a carriage!
hey, charlie!
so, did you bring a little something for ross?
oh.
oh, thanks.
yeah, i did not throw any of that out.. uh, actually, that is.. okay, listen, hey, ross.
why do not you try to relax, okay?
maybe have a drink.
dude, are you okay?
and when are the fajitas going to be ready?
dude, are you okay?
you know what?
i think I am going to stay here and make sure he is okay.
yeah.
I will see you in the morning.
it does not look good, does it?
morning.
here you go.
yeah.
no, no, no.
you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago-soundtrack.
look, ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you do not have to worry about that, okay?
because nothing is going to happen.
well, she and i said from the beginning that we were not going to do anything unless you were okay with it.
and clearly.. it is okay, ross, alright?
i totally understand.
of course you are not fine.
you are.. you are ross and rachel.
that is what i hear, yeah.
come on, i mean, you know me, you know...
I am crazy about her.
i think so.
yeah, but, ross, i mean, you are not okay with it.
no, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me.
are you sure about this?
and we are okay?
(to chandler) dude!
what are yo—you trying to kill me?!
hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe?
huh?
and what about this denise, is she cute?
hey rach, listen i was thinkin’ uh, I am going to have an extra room over at my place… yeah, why do not you move in with me?
it will be great!
we could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about naked thursday’s right?
hey!
(to chandler) dude, some guy just called for you.
i do not know!
how about, "thanks for taking the message."
jeez!
(exits.)
hey, what is up?
but you are still moving in together, right?
because my ad came out today.
(shows him the paper.)
yeah?
i just figured y’know, after living with you it would be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know?
someone i can learn from, someone-someone who is different than me.
and what is more different than me; a guy who is not 19 than say a girl who is 19?
enh?
(points to his head.)
not just a hat rack my friend!
(exiting from chandler’s room with the new roommate) everything on your application looks really good—ohh!
just one last question umm, are you and your friends going to be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
whoa!!
now look, do not be just blurtin’ stuff out.
i want you to really think about your answers.
okay?
oh do not listen to him, he is just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i do not think he is going to get it.
that thing was a hazard!
(to the potential roommate) I am very safety conscious.
umm, listen, ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea?
yeah well, maybe you should go back!
okay?
rachel moves in, and before you know it you are right where you do not want to be!
back together!
that is not going to work out!
then she is going to come home all weepy and you will be tellin’ her, "oh that is okay.
you will find someone."
and then, bamn!
she finds you!
i am telling you ross, she is definitely going to fall in love with you again!
now, is that what you want?
here she comes.
hold on, I am going to make your life much easier.
or not.
uh, rach, why do not you just move in with me?
(rachel sighs.)
no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… it is okay, i mean i—look rach, i know i scared you off with that whole naked thursday’s thing, but we do not have to do that!
thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
(opening the door to the potential roommate) hi!
come in.
thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but i have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
okay now, before i make my final decision i uh, i just want to make sure our personalities match.
okay, so i made up a little test.
now, I am going to say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
okay!
here we go.
pillow.
very good!
okay.
g. excellent!
okay umm, doggy.
ooh, sorry!
no-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye!
(he ushers her out the door.)
oh no, i can not go.
I am practicing; i got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
yeah-yeah, and if i get it by day I will (in a sexy voice) dr. drake remoray, but by night I will be (in an announcer’s voice) joey trrrribbiani!
but the audition’s in a couple hours and i do not even understand the game.
oh really?
that would be great!
you guys can be the contestants!
(announcer voice) all right!
let us play bamboozled!
yeah, is not that a cool name?
all right.
uhh, okay.
our first contestant is ross geller.
why do not you tell us a little something about you ross?
i said a little bit ross.
now, how about you chandler?
excellent!
let us play bamboozled!
chandler, you will go first.
what is the capital of columbia?
it is ba-go-ta, but close enough.
now, you can either pass your turn to ross or pick a wicked wango card.
i should know that.
let us see, just one moment please.
umm, here we are, a wicked wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
this is embarrassing.
(looks it up.)
all right ross you are in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the wheel of mayhem?
okay, this is going to be tough.
hold your breath.
no dude, you got to hold your breath until you are ready to answer the question.
okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, tris…holy cow, that is a big word.
trisc… seriously look at this thing.
chandler, how do you say that?
this one right here.
(ross whines.)
no!
no, fear of the number 13. all right chandler, you are up.
all right.
chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card.
you-you must choose mr. bing.
choose, you jackass!
okay, you picked the gimmie card!
you get all of ross’s points!
(to chandler) in what john houston film would you hear this line, "badges?
we do not need no stinkin’ badges!"
correct!
there is a possible backwards bonus!
yes!
wise choice, how many rungs?
(makes a sound like a monkey) that noise can only me one thing.
okay, it is an audio question, name this television theme song.
(starts humming the theme to i dream of genie.)
yes!
yes, you are back in the lead!
all right!
all right!
uh, umm, super-speedy speed round!
of course!
who invented bifocals?
correct!
which monarch has ruled great britain the longest?
correct again!
but, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
now, over to chandler.
are you sure?
oh my god!
congratulations ross, because chandler, you have been bamboozled!
(announcer voice) it is a pleasure to meet you ray.
(announcer voice) rightie-of ray!
(to the camera) hello, I am joey tribbiani!
let us play bamboozled!
erin, you get the first question!
in hockey, who is known as the great one?
correct!
now, would you like to pick a wicked wango card or spin the wheel of mayhem?
what—why?!
well what is complicated?
you spin the wheel of mayhem to go up the ladder of chance.
you go past the mud hut through the rainbow ring to get to the golden monkey; you yank his tail and boom!
you are in paradise pond!
well what is fun about that?
you expect me to be the host of a boring game that is just people standing around answering questions?
(announcer voice to the camera) let us play bamboozled!
(entering, excited) hey!
so i just talked to one of the dool writers today, and… days of our lives.
anyway, you are not going to believe it!
my character is coming out of his coma!!
and-and-and not only that, I am gettin’ a new brain!!
oh well, they are killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
(seriously) yes, it is a highly controversial procedure.
well, i think it is ridiculous that you have not had sex in three and a half months.
uh cecilia monroe, she plays jessica lockhart.
nice.
oh, tell me about it.
and she is been on the show forever, it is going to be really hard to fill her shoes.
yes, but in drake remoray’s body.
(ross laughs unbelievably.)
why is this so hard for you to get?
i thought you were a scientist!
that was a great scene!
and-and-and that slap looks so real!
how do you do that?
oh anyway, i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are.
say what?
no.
no, I am joey tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday.
i-I am the guy in the coma!
an-an-anyway i-i just wanted to say that since I am getting your brain when you leave the show, i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me… (quickly) i do not know.
why?
did you hear something?
oh uh, one of the writers.
umm… okay.
ms. monroe… (she slaps him) oh there you go.
(she storms off, leaving joey standing next to dina.
they share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)
so you like the nachos uh?
myself I am partial to… see you in 2003.
(she walks away.)
I am so sorry.
look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
no i mean it!
i can not believe they would do this to you!
and to your fans!
i mean they are going to be devastated!
heart broken!
they love you so much!
joey.
uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i, that i came up to you before was because well, I am really nervous about-about being you.
y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character.
y’know?
help me keep jessica alive.
please?
oh that is great!
oh thank you so much!
hey!
now, I have been watching some tapes, how is this?
(in a british accent.)
"jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
ever!!"
yeah.
(shocked) i can do an english accent?!
that baby’s going on my resume!
okay!
(he scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) all right!
okay.
okay.
(he goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
oh well—hey-hey!
maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing.
y’know?
it will-it will give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters.
you are so talented.
hey that is not true!
look at uh, look at angela lansb—angelina jolie!
like-like what?
(impressed) wow!
oh hey come on, do not-do not-do not do this!
umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay?
now when i watch you do a scene, I am thinking, "boy, she-she is a great actress!"
(she is not buying it.)
uh but-but, i am also thinking, "she is hot!"
you own the room.
(she smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.)
we should probably get-get uh… yeah-yeah, i noticed that!
is that ‘because she is so passionate?
yeah!
okay.
(he puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
actually i rent the whole place and, i just got what you meant.
thank you.
hey!

(shrugs) sure.
yep.
okay, bye-bye.
all right, here we go.
(he grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)
thanks for stopping by.
see ya!
(throws them out and closes the door.)
(to cecilia) i-i am so sorry.
i… (notices something in the mail that rachel brought in) oh my god!
they sent me today’s script!
they never send the script!
well no, I am just in a coma.
this must mean i have lines!
(realizes what that means.)
oh… (flipping to the last page) ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
yeah well, I am guessing after this she is not going to be crazy about electricity either.
(as jessica) i do not think so.
oh noo… thanks!
great!
hey!
all right!
well-well what is it?!
the airport?
ohh.
wow!
well how-how, how will you be gone?
that is a really long time.
well i tell ya, i should probably buy a place in the city first.
(realizes.)
and i just got what you meant again—that is—i tell ya, that is a tricky one!
good luck.
oh no, I am sure the xerox machine caught a few.
shut up!
thank you.
there was chocolate on the three.
it looked like an eight, alright?
yeah, we just do not happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
whoa, whoa, whoa, monica, what are you doing?
this is a poker game.
you can not serve food with more than one syllable.
it is got to be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization) about what?
heh... i was bluffing.
you know what, you guys?
it is their first time, why do not we just forget about the money, alright?
(pause)...yeah?
no, i do not think so, see ross, because i think you love her.
alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you do not want to play, we completely understand.
but hey, thanks for teachin' us cross-eyed mary.
you guys, we got to play that at our regular game.
what?
alright, well, I am going to order a pizza.
(gets up) that is fine.
I will just have a tic-tac to hold me over.
uh... phoebe?
phoebe?
me too.
alright, whattaya got.
ahhh, i fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.
(the girls look at him, confused) oh, I am out.
look, rachel, we do not have to do this.
check.
that is ok, ross, you can ask me.
what?
here, i got five, i got five.
(ross takes the money) (to ross): ahhh, that is alright.
y'know, that is a tough hand to beat.
oh!
(triumphantly) the unbearable likeness of being!
wow, the parade is really good this year.
man those horses can crap.
oh my god!
yeah!
i totally forgot I am supposed to be there.
i can not believe i forgot.
i usually write stuff like this on my arm.
i guess I am going to have to come up with a really good reason why i was not there.
the producers are going to be so mad at me.
they sat us all down yesterday and said "everyone has to be there at 6:00 am sharp, that means you tribbiani."
like.. like i was some kind of idiot.
hey happy thanksgiving.. pheebs!
<motions her to come over> i.. i.. i need a good lie.
no, no, no i need a good lie to explain why i was not at a work thing today.
i do not.
somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and i said "hey do not eat that-that is phoebe's" and he said.. <pause> he said.. "joey you stink at lying."
what am i going to do?
oh great, that would be great.
thank you.
uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows phoebe, she looks> oh.. man.. pheebs, i still need some help here oh.. i do not know why this is so hard for me.
you know.. i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor.
hey!
how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's?
do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
i can not believe i won.
yeah he is lying.
he looked down.
i lie better then that, right?
oh, i like that, yeah.
was not at the parade because i had a family emergency.
arg... alright, I will take care of it.
<throws hands out in the air> setting the table.
ooh oooh.. what?
are you out of your mind?
let us throw some jello on them.
actually its not pies, its just pie.
hey!
i did it.
i called my producer.
i told him i had a family emergency, he totally bought it.
thanks for teaching me how to lie pheebs.
oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
(chandler walks back, looking angrily at joey) uhm... (looks down) yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in... maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?
well maybe i love ya’.
yeah!
yeah, why?
what is up?
ye-ye, we go to yours!
how you got three women to marry you, I will never know.
oh, ooh the food smells great, mon!
yeah, hey hey, happy thanksgiving everybody!
well, this has been great!
uh, some of her friends, yeah.
(frustrated) yes, all right?
all of her hot dancer friends are going to be there and they are going to be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really want to go!
yeah, yeah, and the indians taught the pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
rach, you are killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already?
those drunken dancers are waiting!
y-sure!
i know, and only one layer of jam?!
what is up with that?
(turning to chandler in a scolding tone) chandler!
(sad) oh man!
now she is going to start all over!
we are never going to get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
(shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) vomiting stories are funny... did-did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?
(frustrated) still not hot enough!
(to rachel) will you hurry up?
did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janine’s friends are dancers?!
and that they are going to be drinking alot!?
well you are whippin’ so slow!
can not you do it any faster?
oh i am!
ross!
can i talk to you for a second?
okay, look, i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert.
look, when everyone eats that...that...banana-meat thing, they are all going to’ make fun of her, do you want that?
(scolding) dude, they are not objects.
just kiddin,’ I will talk to them, you distract rach.
oh and (ross begins to open the door and joey says some gibberish word to indicate to ross that he is not done yet.
ross closes the door again.)
okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, i learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh!
and smiling (smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?
rachel, there you are!
come on, let us serve that dessert already!
(happily) really?
i like it.
what is not to like?
custard?
good.
jam?
good.
meat?
gooooood.
(pounding the table) i want to gooooooo!
no it is not, i ate that.
nope, got it and i got yours (pointing to jack) too.
so, who is the guy?
well i can promise you, at least one person will be crying.
(points to himself) I am an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
(snaps fingers) are you kidding me?
watch!
(makes funny faces trying to cry) well i can not do it with you guys watching me!
hey!
yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, i had a star named after them.
and i got them a book on karma sutra for the elderly.
i have to go to the bathroom too, but i do not want him complimenting my thing.
i know yeah uh, phoebe!
look umm, i want to apologize about before, okay?
we were being jerks.
parker’s a nice guy and I would like to get to know him.
why?
what-what?
i know I am having the worst time.
there was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when i finally got up to the plates, i slipped on a giant booger!
i guess it could have been, i did not really look at it.
y’know, i just wiped it on chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.
oh hey, you should be excited about him.
there is nothing wrong with him he is a good guy.
yeah.
ya know what i think; i think we were all just being too negative.
actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
nothing… hey.
i do.
there is uh, let us see, guy with a mustache, smokes-a-lot lady, some kids I have seen, and a red-haired guy who does not like to be called rusty.
yeah?
uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time i got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
hey mon, you might want to make some more lasagna too, because something might have happened to a huge chunk of it.
almost cried huh?
hear that chandler?
almost cried!
(about to cry) those two only had each other!
yeah, i saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.
hey pheebs?
hey rach?
that sketch you mentioned?
might it have looked a little something like this?
(he shows her what he is been drawing.)
boy i tell ya, this little talent came in handy before i could afford porn.
(watching the discussion) hey chandler, do we know that lady?
yeah lady!
give us candy!!
what is up buddy?
waiting for candy.
(stepping in and knocking the man over) hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
that is right, it is all ruined!
you guys ruined everything!
you ruined it!
(steps into the apartment and chandler closes the door.)
(joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)
(with his mouth full) oh yeah, sorry about that.
mob mentality or whatever, i do not know… (grabs the note.)
morning!
pretty good.
okay, really good.
anyway i got to go; I am late for work.
yeah—hey, do not worry, she is a terrific girl.
and hey listen, could you do me a favor?
when she comes out could you just mention that I am not looking for a serious relationship; that would be great.
just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork.
tell her uh, I am a loner—no!
an outlaw!
tell her she does not want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
hey, I am going to call her later!
honest!
oh come on, chandler used to do it!
he would even make the girl pancakes!
plus, he would make extras and leave ‘them for me.
fine!
(pause) now, where did we land on those pancakes?
(she chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)
hey!
what is up?
hey-hey, who is your friend?
(erin turns around to face joey, startling him) hey!!
erin!
still here!
why would not ya?
erin is great!
then-then there is you guys.
yeah.
I will uh, I will call ya.
(to erin) okay, good to see you again.
bye-bye.
so, system kind of broke down huh?!
what?!!
no idea?
who do you think brought her here?
man, do you know what guys want!
my beers?!
look you guys, she is a very nice girl.
okay?
we had a good time, but i just—i do not see it going anywhere.
look I am sorry you guys, i-i just do not think so.
hey, do not start judging me!
(to rachel) huh?
you are the one who is in love with her assistant!
(to phoebe) huh?
and you, you are the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
all right, so we should go catch our movie.
i like to see the previews.
(rachel looks at him.)
the candy.
hey!
erin.
(skeptical) what party?

(still skeptical) oh, and how is allison?
(still skeptical) yeah, look how that worked out.
hey.
oh, unbelievable!
we had the best time!
no!
no!
no!
you guys were totally right!
this is so much better than the first time we went out.
y’know?
that was so awkward, we were really nervous.
yeah that really calms me down.
and!
we have so much in common!
she loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that is a… okay.
how can you say that?!
the mets have no closer!
what about game 1 of the series?
you shut up!
(to phoebe and rachel) i love arguing with her.
(to erin) I will be right back.
(returning) hey!
you want to go?
okay.
see you guys later.
(whispers to phoebe and rachel) hey, thank you so much.
(they both exit.)
hey!
oh, it was great!
i mean we walked all around the village.
we went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… and guess what, I am thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
no-no-no-no-no!
it is a surprise, but it is going to be tricky thought because she said she was going to be pretty busy at work for a while.
where are you gettin’ this?
oh.
oh.
no hey rach, it is cool okay?
y’know I am a loner too!
(heads for his room.)
right?
no!
no.
do not do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
yeah?
(coming back out) finally!
all right, i should get going, big day a work.
y’know I am in a coma?
today, they do this test on me and it turns out I am not brain dead.
ah-ah-ah mr. smartie pants, it is just not my character that is not brain dead.
hey, so pheebs, we still on for tonight?
I will see you at 8:00.
(entering) hey!
oh-wha-ho!

mel torme died.

i-i think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back… aww that is nice.
family should be there, huh?
this is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
(entering) hey!
(seeing what they are doing) what do you got there?

oh!
(pulls up his pants.)
sorry.
uh, I have got those plans with phoebe, why?
what?!
tonight?!
after she gave me that big speech?!
she goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?
i think she is trying to pull a fast one on big daddy!
yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?
ohh, then no.
maybe i should hear those specials again.
oh well, that changes everything!
(grabs his menu and starts looking at it again.
the waiter leaves.)
y’know what pheebs?
you were right before.
i mean, friends are so important.
y’know-y’know what i really want?
is to have a long, long talk.
y’know?
get joey out on the open road and really open him up.
yes!
i will have the lobster ravioli.
what is the rush?
what?
whoa-whoa, what is it?
a date?!
no, no pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because i know you would not schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
no, I am going to!!
that is right!
yeah, you made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl!
like-like-like i did something terrible to you!
and now pheebs, you are doing the same thing!
okay, well my girl from the other night was special.
she was a scientist too!
well, she graduated from high school!
fine!
fine!
(to the waiter) what are you still doing here?!
i told you, lobster ravioli!
no!
no!
no pheebs, I am not going to yell at you.
i just y’know, started thinking about you and david and i…remember how bummed you were the first time he left.
and i just… oh pheebs, come here.
(he hugs her.)
are you okay?
hey, y’know you could always visit him.
anything i can do?
whatever you need.
i can give it a shot.
(pulls out a fork) all right, what are we having?
(starts digging in.)
(panicking) dude!
he is right there!
okay, all right, whew!
what do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business?
(ross turns and glares at him.)
hey-hey-hey, i-i-I am just talking here, he-he is the one doing your sister.
(quickly) i call godfather!
sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
(to her) oh, hey katie!
everyone, this is katie.
so, are you ready to go?
oh sure, right back there.
(points.)
i was thinking chinese food.
i do not know.
i mean i like her a lot, and she is really nice, but… (shyly) she keeps punching me.
hey, it is a lot harder than it looks!
okay?
(quietly) she-she-she is hurting me.
(sets the coffee down) y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
uhh, look katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk.
okay?
umm, look i like you.
i-i really do, i like you a lot.
okay?
but sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone is hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
no-no.
yeah, big!
uh-oh, shht!
the misses.
hey!
thanks!
I have been working out.
hey listen, is it obvious that I am wearing six sweaters?
well look, I am breaking up with katie so i had to put on some extra padding.
y'know?
i mean, if she hits me when she is happy, can you imagine how hard she is going to hit me when i tell her I am taking away the joey love?
hey!
hiya!
huh.
uhh….
nah.
what a bad idea!
she is right y'know.
hey ross, will you pass me that knife?
oh, it is okay.
you do not have to be so mean about it.
that is not funny at all!
(hanging up the phone) yes!
guess who is in an audition for a broadway musical?
it is me!
it is a musical version of tale of two cities.
so i think I am going to sing new york, new york, and ah, oh i left my heart in san francisco.
what?

oh, okay.
(to ross) the what?

thanks.
excellent, I will be there.
ahhh!
my ah, my agent said it was not a dancing part.
hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay.
i was not one of the zoom kids either.
yeah, i can dance, y'know.
(starts to dance really, really, really badly) sure, it looks stupid now, there is no music playing.
get out!
i could not stop if a meteor hit me.
well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
(reading) the empty vase.
translucent beauty... whoa, I am not done.

and before you know it, she is with him.
and you will be all, 'ohh, man!'
and he will be all, 'yes!'
and us, we will be like, 'wh-whoa, dude.'
and pretty soon you will be like, (sadly) 'hhiii,' and, and, and, 'i can not go, rachel and mark might be there.'
and we will be like, 'man get over it, it is been four years!!'
so, does that mean the audition is off?
what?!
it is ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.

hey, pheebs, where were ya?
oh, it was great!
yeah, i-i walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know?

(surprised it is lauren) (hugs her) (whispering) where is kate?
(stunned) what?!
oh, ahh, go to the window.
I am want to run down to the truck and show you something.
(grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering) when is she leaving?
(making like he is yelling up to the second floor) I am coming up!
hey!

wh-what is this about l.a.?
but, but wh-what about us?

well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
i mean, I will go to the airport with ya, i-i want to say good bye.

yeah, i guess it is.
(sees kate is watching, he turns lauren so that he can talk directly to kate, but still look like he is talking to lauren) listen, i ah, i got to say good bye, and-and i got to say it quick ‘because this is killing me.
one thing you got to know, is that i will never forget you.
but, you have got things you have to do now, and so do i. and so… I am going to get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I am going to go to blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
but when i return, 200 years from now, you will be long gone.
but i will not have aged at all.
(gets on the ladder) so you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because adrienne, baby, I am going to want to meet her.
well, we were!
but ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
(to monica and rachel) he is talking to london!
well no, not yet.
he is calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
ross!
way to suck up to the family.
(entering, wearing a tux) hey!
do not worry, i had it dry-cleaned.
well, I am doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co-host!
a little uh, good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure, now that is the kind of math joey likes to do!
why do not you like pbs, pheebs?
I am sorry pheebs, i just, y'know, i just wanted to do a good deed.
like-like you did with the babies.
whoa!
whoa!
whoa!
what about you, having those babies for your brother?
talk about selfish!
well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish.
look, there is no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
well, may i ask for one example?
that is because all people are selfish.
are you calling you people?
(chandler rolls his eyes.)
yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds do not exist.
okay?
and you the deal on santa clause right?
that he does not exist.
(to the pledge volunteers) how ya doing?
welcome.
good to see ya!
that is great.
but uh, I am not really expecting a lot of calls.
but I am the host!
you do not seem to understand.
see, i was dr. drake remoray.
(on phone) hey mon!
see, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I am still on tv and that is good exposure.
oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
(he waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on tv.)
hello new york!
(the woman bats his hand out of the way.)
(in a bored voice) pbs telethon.
what?!
what good is that going to do anybody?
now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
come on man!
you have been here all day!
(in an unenthusiastic voice) pbs telethon.
hey pheebs!

all right, so I will call you later.
that would be casey.
we are going out tonight.
no, things are fine with kathy.
I am having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with casey.
yeah-yeah.
and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself!
(laughs) yeah.
why are you getting so upset?
what is the big deal?
it is not like we are exclusive.
you got all that from the back of her head?
who is elaine?
(on the other end at a pay phone) hey, it is me.
listen casey and i were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
we broke down on the parkway, so i have to walk back and get some transmission fluid.
and hey, listen could you please tell kathy that I will be there as soon as i can.
‘because i only have one quarter, and i think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly) yeah?
me too, but i guess i do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real) (on phone) hey dude, it is me.
listen uh, I am really sorry, it looks like I am going to be stuck here for a while.
i got the transmission fluid, but when i went to put it in the car, the transmission was not there!
yeah, it must have fallen out a few blocks back.
i just figured we hit a dog.
listen uh, could you put kathy on, i want to apologize.
aww man!
i can not believe i locked myself out again!
(he knocks on the door.)
(rushing in) oh my god!
what happened here?
did you do all this?
why?
well, you are amazing.
(very excited) a tv as if it appears from nowhere!
that is the dream!
man, how did you afford this stuff?
oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
oh-no-no-no, you are!
you do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, i was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I am going to do that.
no-no-no, i think I am going to see how things go with kathy.
she is pretty cool.
no-no, kathy.
no.
no, kathy.
y’know what i think?
i think somebody is got a little crush on casey.
how ‘bout i fix you two up?
what do you think?
hey!
samboucha margarita?
well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
what is up?
you do?
well, you are timing could not be better.
she is not my girlfriend anymore.
yeah, she broke up with me.
just now, after acting class.
at first i thought she was doing some kind of scene, that is why i let people watch.
well, I have been better.
but, I am all right.
so you like her huh?
no-no-no, no it is uh, it is okay.
yeah.
you know why?
‘because you came to me first.
but hey, listen just so you know, you might have you are work cut out for you.
‘because when i talked to her, i kind of got the feeling that she is into some other guy.
so… who?
what?
and what?!
did you sleep with her?!
what?!!
that is even worse!!
i do not know!
but it is the same!
who cares?!
you went behind my back!
i would never do that to you!
over the line?!
you-you are-you are so far past the line, that you-you can not even see the line!
the line is a dot to you!
is that why you bought all this stuff?!
(chandler makes a face like "well, kind of.")
well, y’know what i will not watch your tv, i will not listen to your stereo, and there is a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I am not going to eat!
you know why?!
because it is all tainted with your betrayal.
from now on this apartment is empty for me!
and I am not happy about you either.
(the bread maker dings) oh, and just so you know, i made that bread for you.
(joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)
probably monica and chandler.
hey guys!
look who is back!
it is ray-ray!
(excitedly) who you what?
who you what?!
(excitedly) wow?
wow what?!
wow what?!
who you—what?!!
what?!
(entering) hello!
hey rach.
(stares at her.)
hey, so where are my parents going to be?
what they are not invited?!
oh no, that is terrible!
they are going to be crushed!
(looking around) you got me.
i do not… well, I am sorry.
i thought parents were coming!
y’know?
your parents are comin’!
chandler’s parents are comin’!
ross’s parents are comin’!
well-well—see?
parents are comin’!
(leaning down to her) maybe you will order a little sangria?
we should really learn how to play the real way.
(moves another piece.)
nice move.
hey!
no, I am performing the ceremony.
I am not wearing a tux.
multi-colored robes!
ooh, and maybe a hat.
i do not think so.
(excitedly) can i come?!
i will not even talk!
you will just hear the noise from my video camera.
oh good!
can i tell her?!
can i tell her?!
okay… hey.
(laughs then seriously) it happened!
why are you taking this away from me?
oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
hey.
yeah, they are not coming.
somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
they…feel a little unwanted.
look mon, if you could just call my mom… come on!
look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there.
let us not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
is it her fault that some of them did not make it to you?
i do not know.
just uh, just tell ‘them it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—no-no-no!
blame it on the post office.
they hate the post office.
and the irish!
but i do not think you can blame it on them so… (he dials the phone and hands it to monica.)
(entering) hey.
listen, i know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is going to start right at six?
right.
right.
the wedding, gotcha.
but i mean, it is going to start a little late right?
i mean, weddings start late.
right?
ah.
yeah.
well look, the thing is it is the same day as my niece’s christening and i really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
‘because my part’s just in the beginning I am not even in the rest of the show—wedding!
okay.
okay, i totally hear ya.
oo how about this?
i vamp a little ‘til they get there?
yeah!
yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd.
ask ‘them where they are from.
‘because in joey tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer.
I am a minis-tainer!
(rapping) there is no one better!
there is no one greater!
(entering) hey!
uh, monica?
chandler?
can i talk to you guys for a second?
no!
no, i-i just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet.
they are so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
okay.
i will.
ohh!
check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
(runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.)
huh?
i wear it like this when i marry you guys, and then this (he tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.
all right, uh… (to ross) oh hey, you have done this before ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
oh, i got it!
how about saying something like, "monica… "…when i look back over our time together…" well, i can not do everything!
look back over your time together.
(yelling through the door) can we come it yet?!
we are dying out here!
hey!
how is "monica, i love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
(shocked) has it been that long?!
hey, it is me!
I am comin' in!
ahh, I am going to go get some chicken.
want some?
okay.
i know!
i mean it is not like we were not cool about it.
(to chandler) you?!
(to monica) and-and you?!
how?!
when?!
in london!!!
but it is a big deal!!
i have to tell someone!
all right!
man, this is unbelievable!
yes, but y'know what?
it does not matter who knows what.
now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
well i did not tell them!
uhhh, phoebe and joey.
and rachel.
i would have told you but they made me promise not to tell!
no.
they know you know.
i could not even if i wanted too.
(entering the hall) oh man!
are not you guys done yet?!
ooh!
i like that!
(to phoebe) oh, okay!
show him your bra!
he is afraid of bras!
can not work  them!
(he swiftly rips open the front of phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
it is not my first time.
so that is it!
it is over!
everybody knows!
i do not want them to move to a volvo dealership!
I am sorry, i just…i like things the way they are.
ooh, look-look-look-look-look!
i got monica naked!
hey.
yeah, you can get a volvo.
if that is what you really want.
hey!
(to chandler) (laughing) funny one!
that is good!
what?
i do not get it.
(starting to cry) i have never known love like this.
if he goes first he can!
(entering) hey!
saw the porsche out there mon, lookin’ good.
when do i get to take that baby out again?
yeah, you got a couple hours?
hey!
so!
you and phoebe huh?
how long have you been going out?
wow!
maybe uh, maybe you and i ought to get to know each other a little better.
so uh, what is your name?
joey.
(they shake hands.)
hey jake, do you like the knicks?
me too!
there is a game on tuesday do you want to go?
pheebs!
listen, you know how uh, when you are wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear?
well, when jake did it i saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!
oh.
(laughs.)
no!
no wait, that is weird!
that is weird!
that is…kind of hot.
yeah, i would not know about that.
yeah well next thing you know, he will be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
hey!
i am secure with my masculinity.
you have seen my huge stack of porn right?
(phoebe nods.)
hey pheebs!
(he sits down next to her.)
check it out.
(he turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows phoebe that he is got panties on.)
how much of a man am i?!
y’know, I am beginning to see what jake was talking about.
the silk?
feels really good!
yeah!
and-and things are not as…smashed down as i thought they were going to be.
yeah!
and you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!
bikini, french cut, thong!
and-and the fabrics!
you have got cotton, silk, lace!
and y’know what I have always wondered about?
pantyhose!
y’know?
they way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here… (he mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.)
i should go take these off should not i?
yeah!
much!
listen uh, not that I am y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but i think i need to hook up with a woman like right now.
yeah!
okay!
(he notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.)
hey!
hi!
y’know, you look familiar.
do i know you from somewhere?
oh!
maybe it is because I am on television.
I am an actor on days of our lives.
yeah.
hm-mmm.
oh, let me get this.
(he takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it.
the woman and waitress are shocked.)
(realizing) (to the woman) these are for you.
i can not believe you said woowoo.
i do not even say woowoo.
c'mon, she is your mom!
uhhhh....
I will just pee in the street.
yeah.
right.
no big deal.
in bizarro world!!
you broke the code!
you do not kiss your friend's mom!
sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
yeah, well, you do not have your racket.
yeah, well you did not call and leave your grip size.
ross, how could you let this happen?
you do not think my mom's sexy?
I will have you know that gloria tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright?
you think it is easy giving birth to seven children?
he forgot to leave his grip size!
so are you going to tell him?
how about because if you do not, his mother might.
uhhhh.... he is not even wearing a jockstrap!
uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
hey, hey, hey, you are lucky i caught them when i did, or else who knows what would have happened.
me neither, y'know what- what are you mad at me for?!
(shouting after him) chandler, i did not kiss her, he did!
(to ross) see what happens when you break the code?
ah!
(points to door) huh?
(leaves and slams the door) (to ross, on the couch) now, here is a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day.
now you tell me she is not a knockout.
c'mon!
just try to picture her not pregnant, that is all.
(laughing) mother-kisser... (sees ross's look) I will shut up.
shh.
he did it.
he told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
no, no.
he said "when are you going to grow up and start being a mom?"
then she came back with "the question is, when are you going to grow up and realise i have a bomb?"
that makes more sense.
i dunno, I have been standing here spelling it out for you!
(goes back to the door) i do not hear anything.
oh, wait, wait, wait.
(looks through the spyhole) hard to tell, they are so tiny and upside-down.
wait, wait.
they are walking away... they are walking away... no, no they are not, they are coming right at us!
run!
run!
you usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
rach, i told you everything i knew last night!
look, it is not that big of a deal, so monica and chandler are doing it.
sorry.
monica and chandler are making love.
(thinks) i do not know.
i do not know.
(thinks) i do not know.
ohh, i know one thing!
they did it right there on the couch.
hey ross!
(eyeing the flattened scone) anybody going to eat that?
(entering from his room) all right!
everybody ready to go to the movies?
really?
oh.
are you sure you do not want to come?
tom hanks, meg ryan, they get mail and stuff.
all right, let us go pheebs.
maybe we should check the trash chute.
that is right, he almost could.
which is exactly how i got stuck there.
(snaps his fingers) he hooked up!
he hooked up with someone.
he hooked up!!
tell us about her!
all right, hold on!
hold on.
hold on.
this is ross, okay?
he is our friend.
he obviously went crazy.
he obviously lost his mind.
phoebe!
do not put ideas in his head!
damnit phoebe!!
all right, put your 20 bucks down.
first one to find the tasty treat wins.
okay?
all right.
let us get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
(he removes the waste bucket that is over the duck and the laundry basket that is over the chicken.)
and they are off!
(he puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
judge rules, no violation.
yeah!
what?!
and the duck gets the nutter-butter!
judge rules, nutter-butter.
yeah.
(entering) hey rach!
hey, you mind if i read my comic books in here?
oh well, chandler and monica are over there and it is kind of hard to concentrate.
umm, hi.
(to rachel) okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
I am not telling, you will have to see it on tv!
no, could not care less.
hey you too!
what?
you were not in it.
oh sorry.
uh-uh, kash?
this is my friend rachel.
rachel, kash, kash, rachel.
(grabbing her) here we go!
here we go!
(starts to pull her away from kash.)
hey!
oh you know uh kash, really liked you the other day.
he said he thought you were charming.
hey, I am with you.
he even asked me if i thought you would go out with him.
i said no.
what?
i…i just figured since you are pregnant you are not going to be seeing people.
i did not tell him.
i did not know if you were telling people.
this is back when i thought kash was still people.
rach look, i really do not think that is such a great… hey!
no.
no.
but I will go see a normal person movie with ya.
it is no ukrainian film.
i set her up with this actor on my show.
no well, i was thinking that it would probably be okay because ross has not gone out with rachel in five years!
hey!
I am an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too!
I am not sure.
i think they are taking the ferry out to some italian place on staten island.
are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
hey kash.
uh hey-hey this is ross.
ross, this is kash.
so what movie do you want to see—and not another one i have to read.
okay?
i get enough of that from books.
all right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it is like enough!
and just wait for rachel to come back from her date?
dude!
what is going on?!
why?
they go on one date and you are worried about them getting married?!
he is not you!
well ross, what did you think she was going to do?
what do you mean?
that is a nice picture.
maybe you can still have that!
hey, can i ask you something?
in this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife rachel?
good call.
yeah.
but, the face ross, the face is not rachel.
i know, but i do not think that is what she wants.
that is okay ross maybe you need a new picture.
okay?
it is not going to be what you thought, but no matter what there is going to be a brand new little baby, your baby.
who cares what the picture looks like?
hey, i tell you what.
let us you and me go out and have some fun.
huh?
whatever you want.
come on!
no, i said fun!
uh… look rach…(ross enters.)
hey ross is here!
hey look!
it is my good friend ross.
hey ross.
hey and look he brought flowers.
thanks ross, but I am really more of a candy guy.
(laughs.)
no.
oh, I am sorry.
i meant no.
oh hey but, before you guys do that (to rachel) i need to talk to you, and ross, i need to talk to you.
(taking chandler aside) hey chandler, can i talk to you for a second?
dude i just did something terrible.
no!
no, that was jack!
rachel thinks i asked her to marry me!
because it kind of looked like i did.
okay well, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand… it was not my ring!
it fell out of ross’s jacket!
and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing!
i guess.
i know!
i know it is awful.
(happily) she said yes.
oh god, what the hell am i going to tell him?
oh, i like that.
yeah… (laughs) now let us not get carried away.
(he walks away as monica comes over and hugs chandler from behind.)
(entering) oh uh, hey pheebs.
uh y’know what?
I will-I will come back later.
(he goes to leave but runs into ross who is entering.)
it can not be me, I am standing right here.
(to ross) we are not peeking?
(follows him.)
hey uh, is it okay to come in?
yeah uh look rach, there is something i got to tell ya.
(watching) yowsa!
(looks away.)
dear lord.
oh uh-uh yeah, i think that… y’know, i do not really know her.
(to god) are you kidding me?!
i do not know!
maybe she is crazy!
(storms out.)
no!
she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
i did not look at it.
stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
look, it is not that easy.
she said she wanted to marry me.
i do not want to hurt her.
you are right.
you are right.
i-I will go tell her now before ross finds out and I will be gentle.
i can do that.
i am a gentle person.
oh, by the way.
two people screwing in there (points to the closet chandler and monica were in) if you want to check that out.
i can come back.
no.
actually, technically, i did not.
no!
no, and i did not ask her to marry me!
no, i did not!
no, i did not!
ahhh!
yeah.
yeah, that looks bad.
but i did not…i did not propose!
okay, the ring fell on the floor and i went down to pick it up and you thought i was proposing.
no, i did not!
no, i did not!
well i tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
(to ross) I will tell you about it later.
be cool.
it was not my ring!
it is ross’s ring!
that is why i felt so bad rach, because he was going to propose.
well, this is awkward.
{see?
i told you so.}
dude, step up!
i proposed.
oh that is right.
there is a lot going on here and i think i ate some bad fruit earlier.
i can not believe you are not going to propose!
oh yeah, dude, i totally understand.
usually after i have a baby with a woman i like to slow things down!
(looking at the ceiling) ah, it is beautiful.
y’know what you guys?
I am uh, I am going to go too.
and uh, I am sorry about everything.
no, rach, i should have told you sooner.
it is just that…man!
that kid is going to town!
(joey makes his awkward exit.)
exellent dream score.
i do not know.
what are you wearing?
hey, hey, chan.
she could work for you.
what the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
how young is young ethan?
young?
would you let it go ross.
it was just a dream.
it does not mean... all right, relax, relax.
just relax, just relax.
be cool, be cool.
services?
(ross looks at him) oh, services.
hey, hey.
how was the first day?
oh... yeah, you do.
(reaches for hi scones) my scones.
all right.
(moves closer.)
so, tell me.
was it like you and chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and chandler?
what?
listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest power ranger is?
stegosaurus!
what about andr�?
they are here already?
uh, moist, yeah.
all right, all right.
(he comes out from their apartment with a huge sandwich in his hand) for the ride.
all right, I am going.
I am going.
all right, all right, all right, let us play one more time, ok?
and remember, if i win you do not move to paris.
just flip!
damnit!
hey!
try it, i can not feel a thing!
(ross starts punching him too) you guys hear a ringing?
hey!
handcuffs!
and fur line, nice!
i did not know you guys had it in ya!
mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend.
maybe richard!
(entering the room) hey.
oh, she is putting emma down, she will be over in a second.
now it just hit her that she is leaving and she is kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
what did i just say?
who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row?
head she wins, tails i lose.
(he stops and starts realizing something) wait a minute... i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
huh, if i had to guess I would say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching.
i really made you think about that thing uh?
(still very emotional) lucky bastard!
all right, let us think about this.
i mean, there is got to be an explanation.
uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
I am sure he is not more bummed out than i am.
oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
(he mimes hitting his head with his fist) who is that dirty old lady?
come on here, have a seat.
chandler, wait, wait, wait... if you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
a little more.
a little more, a little more.
(she stuffs some more down his pants and joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.)
a little more... all right.
okay, all right, let us do this.
yeah.
all right, now give me your best shot.
(in pain) does not work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor) (sees rachel) oh, uh, hey rach.
i uh, i was just coming over here to uh… oh wait, i do not have to lie to you, you do not live here anymore.
uh, I am eating their food.
what are you doing?
whoa, i did not know we could date your sister!
i can not believe ross went out with rachel’s sister!
when chandler made out with my sister i was mad at him for 10 years.
yeah you got 5 years left!
you want to make it 6?!
(crying) you did not cry when bambi’s mother died?
come on man there is got to be something that gets you choked up!
like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
okay, what if the puppy said, "help me chandler.
all the other puppies pick on me."
no!
it is not okay!
it is not okay at all!!
you are dead inside!!
(to the fan) so, you saw me on days of our lives huh?
want me to, want me to do a little dr. drake remoray for ya?
oh, you are phoebe’s fan!
movies?
(laughs) i do not think so.
hey gunther, do not let that guy in here anymore!
he just said phoebe’s a porn star!
uhhh, yeah.
yeah.
but uh, i do not think it is the kind you are going to like.
sort of… (holds up the movie) phoebe’s a porn star!
well down at the adult video place down on bleaker.
all right well, I would better take that back.
we can not watch that!
i mean that is phoebe!
no!
hey no!
this is wrong you guys!
phoebe’s our friend!
well, I am not going to watch it!
yeah.
(sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the tv) you sick bastards!
re!
re!
then i can watch that!
rewind it!
rewind it!
hey!
oh no, not you too!
nice!
that is great, but is not it going to bother that people still think you are a porn star?
you do?
yeah.
(to gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) thank you!
okay.
pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian?
if you want i could loan you some money?
oh, hey, how about this?
want to be an extra on my show?
yeah, yeah.
the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
okay, now.
i got to tell you, being on tv is not as glamorous and exciting as you think.
no it is awesome!
she sure does.
why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
yes you are.
i think it may be time for my sponge bath.
sorry, I am just so used to hitting on the extras.
so, are you excited about your scene?
oh, relax.
do not be.
you will be fine, you will be fine.
they will probably just make you stand in the back.
hey, you know what?
do not worry, pheebs!
it usually takes me three takes too!
(off the director's look) alright, eight.
hey.
well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I am going to replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy."
okay, so he said: "if your puppy friend does not get her puppy act together, I am going to fire her mother-puppy ass."
that is right, you are not.
you are a nurse.
you are nurse with tray.
no, no.
nurse with tray does not know joey, she does not have time for friends.
she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she does not, people die!
(points to man on operating table) man with eye patch!
you get in there and you do your job.
okay.
oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts.
it is okay.
maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
nice.
no, no.
see, you and drake are having a fight.
he slept with you and then never called you.
oh, calm down!
she means on the show!
we need some new extras around here!
please do not fire my friend.
just let me talk to her.
thank you, thank you.
how about i do something for you?
tomorrow, I will bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
hey, listen pheebs.
i was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you do not hit drake, you just wait on the tables?
you are a masseuse.
you have a table with a hole in it.
what?
(to the director) yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security, she will not go easy.
all right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
(takes a glass from the fridge.)
(drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) yep, it is fat.
i drank fat!
we have a half hour.
relax ross, we will be ready.
it only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
hey, ross, want some cider?
glass of fat?
what is a matter ross?
what you are nervous about your speech?
am i in it?
whoa!
what?
how is this your seat?
but then you left.
what is the big deal, sit somewhere else.
well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom).
soo... all right!
you can have the chair.
oh my, would you look at that!
(holds up crossed fingers) I am so sorry.
me too.
in fact, i think i might be a little too comfortable.
monica, how are you going to do that?
wow, what a cool job.
(in a machine voice) 'you have two new messages.'
'please, pass the pie.'
hey, you can not say you are breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
now she sounded breezy.
okay.
(he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave) you said i had to give you the chair, you did not say anything about the cushions.
that is right!
I am taking the essence.
(entering) where is my underwear?!
because, I am not wearing any underwear now.
it is a rented tux.
okay.
I am not going to go commando in another man's fatigues.
okay, you hide my clothes.
I am going to do the exact opposite to you.
hey, opposite, is opposite!
(leaves) okay, buddy-boy.
here it is.
you hide my clothes, I am wearing everything you own.
look at me!
I am chandler!
could i be wearing any more clothes?
maybe if i was not going commando... yeah.
whew, it is hot with all of this stuff on.
i ah, i better not do any, i do not know, lunges.
(starts doing lunges) yeah, ross, way to ruin it.
i was just going to get dressed.
you could drink the fat.
yaaaay!
let us see what else he will do!
(enters) hey you guys I am going to take off.
i just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
(he looks around the room) this is not the right room, sorry folks.
(leaves) why are you so tired?
you know what you should have done, you should have told yourself that little story.
hey so where is ross?
is he still mad at us?
that is not fair!
i can not do that.
see this is what i was afraid of, i did not think i should be here either but somebody (looks at chandler) said he would be over it by now.
(entering) hey.
(ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it is joey he just ignores him and turns back around.)
ross, i know you are pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
fine, fine okay.
but i got to say technically, i did not even do anything wrong.
i said i did not technically.
look, can i just stop you right there for a second?
when people do this (makes quote marks with his fingers.)
i do not really know what that means.
(ross just looks at him) you were saying?
i know i should have.
(makes quote marks again.)
"I am sorry."
no, come on ross!
(he grabs his bag so he can not leave) look, ross, we have to get past this.
no, look, i do not know what else to do.
i said I am sorry!
you should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
why not?
you will feel better!
I will feel better, and you know you want to.
i can see it in your eyes.
a little bit.
little bit.
(excited) a little bit more.
no, hit me hit me.
hit me!
(interrupting) hit me, hit me.
(shouts) hit me!
hit me!
I am sorry!
it was a reflex!
i could not help it!
when a fist comes at your face, you duck!
look!
(he goes to punch ross, expecting him to duck, but he does not and joey punches ross.
gunther is amused.)
you were supposed to duck!!!
why did not you duck?
good, good yeah, (grabs the bags) maybe while we are there, they can check your reflexes.
(joey opens the door and it hits ross in the face with it.)
(makes quote marks.)
"oops."
hey, so how is it?
your thumb?
that is weird.
(makes a fist.)
you sure you are punching right?
make a fist.
(ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.)
maybe later.
ross i feel terrible.
you, you want me to help you with that?
name?
(ross looks at him.)
i know ross but what is it short for?
you know like, like rossel or rosstepher.
it is pretty, okay date of birth?
sure, may...tember.
occupation?
dinosaurs.
alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
come on, you guys are more then that!
i mean, you are going to get together right?
but you two were supposed to be together.
come on, ross, that did not mean anything!
she just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
so?
wow.
really?
and you are okay with that?
hey, for what it is worth, with rachel i do not think you will ever be just (makes quote marks.)
"anybody."
(makes quote marks) "thanks."
you know, ah, I have been thinking about this and i got to tell ya, it is not my fault.
it is a natural instinct.
hey ok great, what would you do if i did this?
(swings to punch chandler, he moves and he ends up punching ross, knocking him off the stool.
ross then gets up and just stares at joey.)
chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
whoa, dude, look out!
you almost crushed my hat!
(he picks a hat up from the floor.
it is one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
oh!
yeah, look there is this play all right?
and I am up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy.
a real clothes horse.
so i figure that everyone at the audition is going to be wearing this kind of y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
great!
thanks, rach!
all right.
are you all right?
pheebs!
sorry!
pheebs, I am so sorry.
all right, then you would better show me some of that too then.
really?
a purse?
it looks like a women's purse.
see look, women, carrying the bag.
(he puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.)
but it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
maybe you need sex.
i had sex a couple days ago.
well, i are not going to say no to that.
hey!
what?
are you referring to my man's bag?
at first, i thought it just looked good, but it is practical too.
check it out!
it is got compartments for all your stuff!
your wallet!
your keys!
your address book!
yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
(removes a sandwich and starts eating.)
why would i return it?
i love this bag!
fine!
do you take vasa or mustercard?
(he is holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)
all right relax, look I will pay you with the money from the acting job i am definitely going to get thanks to you.
you-n-i-sexy?
(smiles provocatively.)
hey pheebs, I am so sorry.
here, i brought you some flowers.
(he pulls them out of the bag.)
(approaches, wearing his glasses) hey you guys, check it out.
check it out.
(moves his hand towards and away from his face.)
it is like it is coming right at me.
(chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)
what did you say to him?
(entering, with bag) hey!
I am off to my audition.
how do i look?
y'know what?
make fun all you want.
this is a great bag!
okay?
and it is as handy as it is becoming.
now, just because you do not understand something, does not make it wrong.
all right?
so from now on you guys are going to have to get used to the fact that joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag!
(exits.)
(reading from the script) well, you must be new here.
why do not we get a table and I will buy you a drink.
yeah, sure.
(he takes it off and starts reading.)
well, you must be new here.
maybe we should—I am sorry, can i ask you something?
(he stops and asks a question.)
well, first it is not a purse.
i mean if-if you are thinking it is a woman's bag, it is not.
it is a man's bag!
all right look, let me show you the catalog!
(does so.)
see?
huh?
it is the latest thing!
everyone is got one!
men!
women!
children!
everyone is carrying them!
noooo.
no-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
yeah but i did not read anything.
okay!
all right, I will see ya.
(as he is walking off stage.)
(patting the bag.)
we got it!
we got it!
(dejected) hi.
estelle said i did not get it.
(sits down next to rachel on the couch.)
yeah, i thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
well to tell you the truth, they uh, (pause) they had a problem with the bag!
y'know what?
it was a stupid play anyway!
i do not want to give up the bag.
i do not have to give up the bag!
do i rach?
(she is avoiding his eyes.)
oh, you think i should give up the bag!
i can not believe I am hearing this!
hey, would not be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby?
we could call it chuck.
(with a disgusted look) what was it?
no, it is too wrinkly to be a mole.
yeah, right.
so pheebs, do they know about each other?
hey.
(going over to him) well?!
well what is it?!
oh!
maybe they will name yours after you!
y'know, they will call it, the ross.
and then people would be like, "awww, he is got a ross."
whoa, that does not necessarily mean that he is breaking up with you.
yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
whoa-whoa-whoa.
what ah, what happened to playing the field?
okay, good, so there you go.
go with vince.
oh sure, go with the sissy.
oh no-no-no-no, i meant chandler.
whoa!
for a rich guy he is got, that is a pretty small tv.
look at this!
a millionaire's checkbook.
hi, how ya doing?
(looking at the checkbook) wow!
look at this!
he wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to hugo ligrens ring design.
(monica is stunned) oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
yeah, yeah.
he is got a, he is got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can not do anything about it.
is there something you can do?
boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
i got this pair marked excess, i got to tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
that is right ross, i can see you in your new apartment!
and you can see me!
same as yesterday, (to monica) same as the day before.
nope.
op, wait!
there he goes.
(waving) very funny ross!
very life-like and funny.
okay.
(notices that a woman is waving back.)
oh no-no-no, i was not waving at you lady.
(she just stares at him.)
(joey sees how beautiful she is.)
whoa, maybe i was!
hey, monica, this totally hot girl in ross's building is flirting with me.
yeah, i-i-I am down with that.
(he turns back to the woman.)
okay, here goes.
(thinks.)
how (holds up his hand like an indian) you (points at her) a-doing?
(does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks.
she smiles and waves again.)
(to monica) it worked!
she is waving me over.
(towards the woman.)
okay, i-i-I will be right over.
let us see, she is on the third floor… tell me about it, huh?
(realizes that she can see monica.)
oh no-no-no, I am not with her, she is just monica!
(he pantomimes that out.)
ewwuck!
(he pushes monica away and makes a disgusted face.)
this is your place?
but i counted, you are not supposed to live here!
oh man!
(runs away.)
ugh!!
i ended up at ross's place.
oh, i musta missed counted or something.
(looks out the window.)
damn!
she is not there anymore.
oh, l-l-look, ross is doing his 'watching tv' bit.
(we see ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)
did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
what happened?
you kissed him?!
i bet that kiss is not looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
yeah!
(chandler makes a noise) no?
oh rachel look, do not say that, i think you just need a hug from joey.
come on.
come on.
(she hugs him and joey looks out the window.)
she is back!
hot girl's back!
no, in ross's building!
(he throws rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.)
she is back!
she is back!
(pantomimes) okay, wait there, I will be over in a second.
(he counts where she is again.)
got it!
(runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)
damnit!!
did you move?!
(looking around) uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
yeah.
sorry about that.
(he walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.)
oh, hey little girl.
uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
later!
(he runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.)
oh man!
(walks down the hallway in desperation.)
hot girl!
hot girl!!
(entering) hey guys!
(sees their state of undress) what 'cha been doing?
(has a silly grin.)
i do not know.
but i can see through your sheet.
(he looks out the window.)
yeah, yeah, that is her.
but y'know what?
does not matter, I am never going to get to meet her anyway.
because it is impossible to find her apartment!
she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
no.
no.
no.
she lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
i did not know that!
thank you monica.
(starts to leave) i can not believe i almost lost another girl because of counting.
dahhhhh!!
(ross has a puzzled look on his face.)
no!
noooo!!
(storms off.)
there is the waitress.
excuse me, miss.
hello, miss?
no, no... how come you are working here?
I am sayin’ i see a difference.
i do not care.
phoebe’s phoebe.
ursula’s... hot!
yeah.
hey pheebs, guess who we saw today.
nope.
nope.
not from where i was standin’.
i went back to riff’s.
i think ursula likes me.
all i ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
she is so hot!
pheebs?
you think it would be okay if i asked out your sister?
so that if we went out on a date, she would be there.
cool, thanks.
hey.
phoebe, could you do me a favour?
could you try this on?
i just want to make sure it fits.
oh, no no no.
it is for ursula.
i just figured, you know, size-wise.
yep.
ice capades.
i do not know.
i like her, you know.
she is different.
there is uh, something about her.
hey, phoebe, i asked you, and you said it was okay.
okay... well maybe now I am not okay with it not being okay.
out.
(spreading his arms wide) yes.
well, not that it is any of your business, but, no, we have not, okay?
you meant sex, right?
hey!
you are back!
(hugs and kisses all around.)
a couple?
like two people?
like (points to himself) one (points to phoebe), two people?
y’know what?
why do not you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
hm-mm!
yeah nice necklace!
you are welcome buddy.
whom.
(everyone looks at him shocked.)
that is right.
yeah!
you got to tell a girl before you tape her.
such a rookie mistake.
yeah!
ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
hey, hang up!
you get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.
all right!
I will have a sandwich!
oh i think we do.
y’know what?
do not worry about it, you still got me and phoebe.
personal thing?
what personal thing?
i do not know.
(laughs) yeah i knew what you were talkin’ about.
hey.
sure.
what?
about uh, you showering with your mom?
whoa, for like months?
six months?
whoa that is rough.
the sky’s blue ross and i had sex yesterday!
okay.
okay.
umm…ooh!
oh-oh, i got something.
it is this story i came up with, very romantic.
i swear any woman that hears it; they are like putty.
okay.
now you are going to want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
okay.
(clears throat) years ago, when i was backpacking across western europe… have a nice six more months ross!
(starts to leave.)
i was just outside barcelona hiking in the foothills of mount tibidabo.
i was at the end of this path and i came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.
and there were tall trees all around.
(whispering) it was dead silent.
gorgeous.
(softly) and across the lake i saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying… whoa!
what are you doing here?
how did your date go?
hey!
look, if it did not work it is because you did not tell it right!
show me how you did it.
how long since you have seen a girl naked?
I am not feeling it.
no!
no!
no ross!
I am not hot!
are you hot?
well you are not selling the story!
it is like; it is like you do not believe it!
look, i got to go.
i got a date, but try this.
do what i do when I am preparing for an audition.
okay?
I will set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you are doing wrong.
all right now… all right, you are all set up.
you are good to go.
just hit record.
all right?
good luck.
yeah?
(trying not to laugh) that means a lot to me man.
(exits.)
y’know what?
this is not fair to her.
let us just forget the tape!
you are right.
(mouths, "i know you will show me, right?)
loud and clear!
(mouths, "you will show me," and nods.)
y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably did not give you real names either.
oh yeah?
(to phoebe) hi, ken adams, nice to meet you.
uh no rach, he is gone.
but listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
(confused) are we watchin’ the tape or not?!
(to phoebe) I am so happy!
how do you know about that story?!
(raises his hand) some guy!!
(points to himself.)
(raises his hand and points to himself again) ken adams!!
hey... hey listen... what do you guys know about investments?
well, I am starting to make good money on the show and I am thinking... i should probably do something with it.
well, i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.
(realises that anyone could have overheard that) i did not say that!
it is in a bank guarded by robots!
uh, yeah... this guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm.
that would be kind of cool huh?
pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus... (laughs) yeah!
right!
(points at monica) people eat birds... bird meat... now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "excuse me, I will have a bucket of fried bird."
(laughs again) or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...) real estate, huh?
hmmm... hi I am joey.
this is chandler.
is there anything we should know about the apartment?
well, you seem pretty insulted by that.
what?
I am not good enough for you?
you know what it is?
it is a nice place but i got to see i do not know if i see myself living here.
oh, oh, oh, let me see... (joey sits down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) yeah, i could see it.
what?
ooh!
a tape with a girls name on it.
it is probably a sex tape... (realises) wait a minute... this says monica... (looks around) and this is richard's apartment... (realises some more) hey dude, what is up?
did you take that tape?
i do not know.
who'm I am married to?
she hot?
how did she get me to settle down?
guess i do not know.
my experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... she does not say no to much else, i tell ya... (backs off) what?
whoo... what?
all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame... (chandler turns his back to the tv.
joey puts the tape in the vcr, switches it on and watches what is on the tape... it is clearly a american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...) well it is okay, its like... its just a football game.
yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
you do not want to see what i just saw!
(at this moment monica comes home, and sees chandler flat on his back on the floor and joey pinning him down) (laughs) monica, look... i do not think you and i have any secrets anymore... (monica keeps looking at joey) not ready to joke about it yet, okay, i see you later.
(joey walks out) guggly worm.
glow-pop giggly jammer.
(examining it) ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
(monica drops the sandwich) (going over and picking up the rod) that is all right.
hey you guys, you know what is going to be great about the fishing trip this year?
when my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "joey, what are you doing with your life?"
stuff.
i can say, "well, I am doing a movie with charlton heston dad.
what are you doing with your life?"
look, there is nothing i can do for him right now, he is still in his sweat pants, that is still phase one.
y'know?
I will be back for phase two, i would never miss phase two.
gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.
which helps him get to phase three, picturing yourself with other women.
yeah.
(entering) hey-hey!
oh my god, you guys have no idea.
yeah, three days on the lake without a shower.
plus!
i fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand!
hey, how-how is he doing?
(goes over to chandler) hey buddy!
how is it going?
(to the rest of the gang) hey, see that?
he just needed his pal to come home.
all right, uh, I have got to go memorise my lines.
(starts to go his bedroom) me and charlton heston bright and early tomorrow morning!
yeah-yeah!
(running from his bedroom) oh my god!
i overslept!
i was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago!
i got to get out of here!
look, i know i feel asleep before i could shower and now i do not have time!
they are just ten blocks away, if i run, i can make it.
(rushing in) hey!
joey tribbiani!
I am here!
I am here!
look at that, charlton heston eating a liquorice whip!
(trying to act like he is not the one that stinks.)
whoa!
yeah, what the hell is that?
what smells so bad?
y’know, i can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who i think it is?
no-no, it is uh, it is heston.
yeah, the man wreaks!
smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
really, a shower huh?
and uh, which-which room might that be?
interesting.
how ya doing?
i guess you would not believe me if i said i was kurt douglas, huh?
no-no-no, no, no, wait.
you see, I am an actor, joey tribbiani, I am doing a scene with you today, and well, i stink.
yeah-yeah, I am one of the cops that will not work with you ‘because you a lose cannon.
anyway, look, I am really sorry, but i stink!
yeah.
oh no-no-no, you do not understand… oh yeah, yeah.
yes sir!
yes sir, I am-I am—(he starts to leave) yeah.
oh, yeah.
i do not want to.
i wanted to go to the strip club!
yeah, all right.
(ross enters.)
can i see the comics?
okay, may i see the comics?
yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
well ross was hangin’ out over at our place, rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from chandler.... anyway!
her and ross just started yelling at each other.
well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
i had the same dream!
oh, i had the opposite dream.
yeah, i mean it is never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
rach, it is, it is ah, it is not that we do not want to, really.
(quietly) are we talking models in their underwear?
(he turns around to chandler looking for approval to go with rachel, chandler mouths ‘come on!’) (turning back to rachel) ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
oh yeah.
you are smoking again?!
(obviously cold) hey, can you close that window chandler?
my nipples can cut glass over here!
it will be great for next weekend.
it will be great for next weekend.
i mean, (in an irish accent) it will be grrreat.
uh, pheebs we kind of need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I will stay.
(to chandler and monica) hey, does anybody else feel bad about ross?
what?
mine are not tinted.
oh, now i have to go!!
what is going on?
relax okay, i-i-i can get this open.
anybody have a coat hanger?
look, i just need a wire something to jimmy it.
oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
come on!
who has the biggest boobs?
whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
if you want to get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
thank you phoebe, that is very, very generous.
(opening the door) and there you go!
oh yeah, smokey joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
okay, done.
that is ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
arrrghh!!
guys, do you think we should ask ross to come along?
i-i can not handle this, you guys.
(pause) what?
(pause) what?
yeah, and not put us in the middle.
oh what, wait, wait a second, i mean, what are we doing?
who is going with who?
come on man, you drove all the way up here.
(impressed) wow, that was great!
you really wrote that?
i *love* my job.
rach, these are for you.
no, but with this new car smell, you will think you do.
uh-huh.
and for ross, mr. sweet-tooth.
they are ribbed for *your* pleasure.
ahh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma?
hey-heeyyy - look at that, it is a christmas miracle!
hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?

this guy says hello, i want to kill myself.
ohh.
and you never knew she was a lesbian... alright ross, look.

c'mon, you are single!
have some hormones!
i say push her down the stairs.
(comforting her) and hey, you need anything, you can always come to joey.
me and chandler live across the hall.
and he is away a lot.
what, like there is a rule or something?
who is paul?
hey, paul!
here is a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
hey pheebs, you want to help?
I am thinking we have got a bookcase here.
(picking up a leftover part) what is this?
which goes where?
done with the bookcase!
hey-hey-hey-hey, if you are going to start with that stuff we are outta here.
ross, let me ask you a question.
she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv- what did you get?
you got screwed.
shut up!
what are you talking about?
'one woman'?
that is like saying there is only one flavor of ice cream for you.
lemme tell you something, ross.
there is lots of flavors out there.
there is rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing!
cherry vanilla.
you could get  them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream!
this is the best thing that ever happened to you!
you got married, you were, like, what, eight?
welcome back to the world!
grab a spoon!
great story!
but, i uh, i got to go, i got a date with andrea--angela--andrea...  oh man, (looks to chandler) right.
thanks.
it is june.
I am outta here.
(exits.)
congratulations.
listen, while you are on a roll, if you feel like you got to make like a western omelet or something... (joey and chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.)
although actually I am really not that hungry... morning, paul.
that was not a real date?!
what the hell do you do on a real date?
yeah, I am an actor.
i doubt it.
mostly regional work.
look, it was a job all right?
i will not take this abuse.
(walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
you should both know, that he is a dead man.
oh, chandler?
(starts after chandler.)
(sitting on the arm of the couch)of course it was a line!
(bursts out laughing again) i can not believe you did not know it was a line!
i can not believe what I am hearing here.
oh, you would not know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
hey pheebs!
listen, uh can you do me a favor?
i forgot the pin number to my atm card can, can you get it for me?
uh, i scratched it on the atm machine down on the corner.
that is it!
thanks pheebs!
no!
(she nods no to chandler) because he did not believe in my movie!
which is a big mistake because it is real!
real!
uhh, my stunt double.
yeah, and y'know, he is getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
uhh pheebs, i heard that.
can you put him on?
do not come out here!
i got that!
i forgive ya!
do not come out here!
well, I am totally over it chandler.
friends forever!
do not come out here!
uh, entertainment tonight.
[cut to chandler] yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and do not come out here.
all right.
(hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)
hi!
what-what are you guys doing here?
i thought i told you not to come.
uhh, because I am shooting a scene right now.
yeah, i uh, i play a gladiator.
uh, y'know what?
hold-hold on a second.
(to no one in particular) can we cut?
yeah, my-my friends are here, I am going to take a little break.
they uh director.
uhh, her.
(points to an old woman standing behind him.
who glares at him and walks off.)
all right, all right, it is not a gladiator movie.
i work here.
well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I am working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
look, I am sorry i did not tell ya.
(to chandler) I am sorry man.
yeah, what-what is going on?
dawson?!
aww, there we go.
ooh, so close.
whoa!
whoa!
guys!
please!
come on!
come on!
this is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
hey-hey do not look at me!
i just work here!
(walks away.)
hey, y'know in roman times this was more than just a hat.
yeah, sure!
sure!
they would uh, they would scrub the floors with it!
they would use it to get the mud off their shoe.
and sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right… all right well, I will take you someplace nice then.
look!
a guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000.
can you believe that?
$5,000!
wait a minute!
why do not i do what that guy did?
I will take this $100 and turn it into $5,000!
and then I will turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
chandler!
i do not need luck.
i have thought this through!
(to the dealer) can i change a hundred?
(he hands him his chip.)
(betting all 100) let us ride.
hit me!
(he does so.)
ohh man!
(joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards joey notices something.)
wait!
(he holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)
chandler!
you are not going to believe this!
i have found my identical hand twin!
my identical hand twin!
what is it sound like?
it is a guy with my identical hands!
it was incredible!
chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me!
it-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
do not you see what this means?!
i can forget about that stupid movie.
I am going to be a millionaire!
look, i do not have it all worked out yet, but it is got to mean big money!
come on!
identical hands!
this is vegas man!
people will pay to see freaky stuff!
okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (holds up his left hand) twice?
huh?
hey, are you unsupporting me again?
pheebs!!
i found my identical hand twin!
(entering) hey-hey-hey you made it!
all right!
hey-hey!
who is your friend?
he is hot!
(ross laughs and rachel smacks him with her purse.)
no, do not be sorry.
i do not need it anymore.
i found my identical hand twin!
my identical hand twin!
the person whose hands are exactly like mine!
this thing is a gold mine!
okay.
well, if that is how you feel about it, fine!
none of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion!
except uh, you pheebs.
you can live in the thumb.
(entering) uhh, hey.
where is the other guy?
he is kind of tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this.
(holds up his hand.)
see?
okay!
(walks away, then turns back.)
how you doing?
right!
okay.
(heads for the bathroom.)
oh-oh-oh, yeah!
(he grabs some towels and takes them to him.)
that is right, you take good care of those babies!
it is me, joey!
(holds up his hand) joey!
okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
look, you and i have been given a gift.
okay?
we have to do something with it.
like-like, hand modeling!
huh?
or-or magic!
and you know nasa's going to want to talk to us!
(stopping him) whoa!
whoa!
whoa!
whoa-whoa!
we could have our own show!
y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it!
huh?
and-and-and i wrote a song for us!
(singing, to the tune of this land is your land) this hand is your hand!
this hand is my hand!
oh wait, that is your hand!
no wait, it is my hand!
(following him) but you have not even heard the chorus!
hey!
hi!
look-look-look you guys, i need some help!
okay?
someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
yeah!
I am fine!
thanks!
(he starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.)
hey rach, how you doing?
ross, do not let her drink anymore!
(exits) (sitting down) ahhh!
(slides his hands across the table.)
no-no, i do not really have any money.
not yet, anyway… (shakes his hands.)
(throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world.
{y'know, looking at it now, they really do not have that similar of hands.
joey's are bigger.})
ooh-ho-ho!
(the dealer stares at him and he stops.)
hit me!
(he does so.)
uhh, ms. phalange, may i ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
would not you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
me?!
oh come on, man!
you can not do this!
come on!
(being dragged out by the guard) I am your hand twin!!
hey!
yeah!
she is cool, and she is so smart!
her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being joey, he mispronounces "amonious").
(pause) that is not how she used it...?
hey, if you want to grab a bite before work we would better get acrimonious.
no?
am i getting close?
(sipping red wine from a glass) who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
heeey!
come on in, how are ya?
can i offer you a drink?
uh-oh.
i hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today i had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself) yeah, definitely, definitely.
ok, what do you want to see first?
(looking puzzled and nodding) ok!
i know, yeah!
ok, let me stop you right there.
the mets suck, ok?
you want to see the yankees.
which one, they all suck!
(looking puzzled) i do not think so.
ross!
i need to talk to you about charlie.
yeah, I am...
I am kind of having a little problem.
no, look, you know charlie, right?
she is cool, she is funny, her body is soo... yes.
it is just that she is so much smarter than all the girls I have ever dated!
combined!
i do not want her to think I am stupid!
(checking) eh, what do you know!
right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and i do not know how to talk about that stuff.
you got to help me out!
please, c'mon, you are the smartest person i know and i really like this girl, ok, i do not want to lose her.
thanks.
the metsss!
(realizing) oh, that is what she meant!
(pause) you know, if they are going to shorten it, they should call it the muse!
you know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
ok, all right, so I will take her to the met.
geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
whoa, whoa, whoa!
slow down, you go way too fast.
ok?
just go back to the met, ok?
you got to tell me exactly what to do there.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
so, i walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left.
ross then bends joey's arm to the right and joey nods) (gesturing at an imaginary painting) note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas.
monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!)
no, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
phonetically?
(looks confused) ok. ah!
I am an actor!
i can memorize anything!
last week on "days" i had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
no idea!
but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means "you are going to get eaten by a bear".
ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure.
touch it, it is really bumpy!
(reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).
come on!
you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again) hey!
(to charlie) you are ready?
(aside, to ross) hey ross!
that art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
although some of that stuff was not where you said it was going to be, but... (confidently) i made it work.
(entering) hey ross!
listen, do you want to go see that new imax movie on tide pools?
(laughs) no.
but i got knicks tickets for you, me, and chandler.
all right, well finish your coffee; let us go.
to tape the game?
you do this every time ross, you are not going to be on tv!
oh, you are switching apartments?
but rachel has an apartment.
she is?
i guess i did not really think about it.
hey!
oh, okay.
i…i ate way too much.
ooh.
(notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.)
so umm, i was talkin’ to ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
i was kind of hoping you would stay.
no room?
it is a baby.
it is like this big.
(holds his hands about a foot apart.)
y’know, i mean you-you could you could put it over here.
(a desk.)
or-or-or we could put it right here.
(the chair.)
aw, it is cute, right?
or-or we could put it over here.
(by the bathroom door.)
you would not even notice it.
where is the baby?
(mumbles that it is over in the corner.)
i could use a challenge!
it is getting pretty easy.
i love living with you so much.
i just wish things did not have to change.
y’know i blame ross for this.
I am going to miss you, you are the hottest roommate i ever had.
hey!
uh, this is just to give you an idea.
okay well, we can put screens here, (in front of the crib.)
so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib.
and uh—oh look!
here is a baby monitor (holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies.
huh?
ahhhhhhhhhhhh….
that-that-that is really just to show where the baby would go.
y’know why do not i hold on to him so that there is no confusion?
(takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)
I am loud!
I am up all night!
hello!
look, if I am bringing home a woman who can not stand being around a baby, then maybe i do not want to be with that woman!
or maybe we will just do it in the bathroom of the club!
yeah!
all right—look, i know sometimes it will be hard, okay?
but, it will also be really…really great.
please rachel!
i-i-i really want you to stay.
ohh!
i know!
i found it on the street.
yeah.
i do not know.
ew.
ooh!
ah!
okay!
(quickly drags the crib outside.)
is not that great?
hey!
no.
y'know how we are always saying we need a place for the mail.
well, i started building one.
but then i decided to take it to the next step.
no, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in.
it is a one day job, max.
oh yeah.
these are my old work pants, sergio valente’s.
power saw kind of got away from me there.
her what?
hey, monica, who would yours be?
it is just a game mon.
(makes a ‘can-you-believe-her’ face to the rest of the gang.)
rach, how about you?
hey-hey!
i know.
oh, I am sorry.
did i get ‘ya?
calm down, do you want this unit or not?
well, you should have told me that before, I am not a mind reader.
hey, we are out of beer.
I am going to monica’s.
oh monica, listen, i ah, i saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale.
if you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
nothing.
it is just old and dingy, that is all.
oh yeah.
if you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.
(monica gasps) yeah.
relax.
here hold this (hands her his beer).
this old stuff just comes right off.
(he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)
(manages to pry off only a small piece) aw!
look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down.
it would take forever to pry this up.
you should ah, you should just leave it.
(starts to walk away, but monica grabs him) eh!
there you go.
(yelling from bathroom) hey, does somebody want to hand me one of those tiles.
ooh, very official.
why do not we just go on two.
because it is faster.
all right, but in the future... so we are going on two?
wow, it is big!
maybe, my ruler’s wrong.
look it is not that bad.
so what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
yeah, listen, before i forget that side is still wet.
y'know what?
i bet ‘ya ya i could fit in there.
(points to a hole in the center) get out your checkbook, mister.
you are dogged man!
i totally fit!
thank you.
cha-ching!
(chandler starts to leave) oh, well hello mr. lincoln.
better luck next time buddy.
(chandler leaves and closes the door) and the drinks are on me!
hi everyone.
well, chandler's old roomate was jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... happy chanukah, everyone.
what is up man?
(to everyone) oh my god!
he is trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre!
(on phone) chandler, listen.
(says something intentionally garbled) ok... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library.
we have a winner!
it is never going to happen.
you and rachel.
because you waited too long to make your move, and now you are in the friend zone.
ross, you are mayor of the zone.
priesthood!
look ross, I am telling you, she has no idea what you are thinking.
if you do not ask her out soon you are going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
yeeeeaaaahhh!
what is messing you up?
the wine?
the candles?
the moonlight?
you have just got to go up to her and say, 'rachel, i think that...' (rachel comes into the room behind them) are you going to do it?
do you want any help?
good luck, man.
ok. (ross goes out on the balcony to talk to rachel) hey, where are you going?
you can not go out there.
because of... the reason.
i, um, can not tell you.
ok, you have got to promise that you will never, ever tell ross that i told you.
he is planning your birthday party.
(as phoebe enters) you would better act surprised.
hey, do not look at me.
this is ross's thing.
sorry, that was wax.
(does a maniacal laugh) bwah-hah-hah!
hey ross.
this probably is not the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for monica.
whoa-whoa, treeger made you cry?
I am going to go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
all right that is it, school is in session!
(exits and slams the door.)
hey!
you hold on pal!
now you made my friend, rachel, cry.
so now, you are going to go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
have you heard about a little something called, not making girls cry.
i have actually not heard of that.
why do not you tell me something i do not know!
(he storms out, and once treeger closes the door behind him, joey makes an ‘oops!’ have.)
well uh, i went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he would better come up here and apologize.
I will see you later.
(starts to leave) he said that he was not going to apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he is going to do is have you evicted—I will see you later.
well he made rachel cry!
all right!
I will try!
but if i can not, you can stay with chandler and i until you get settled.
all right, all right, all right.
(starts to leave, stops, and turns around) i mean I will have to check with him first, but I will think he will be cool with it.
(monica shoos him out.)
please do not kick monica and rachel out, this was not there fault, it was mine.
no you can not do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames.
I am the chick and chandler is the duck.
come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I will do whatever you want.
yeah-yeah, absolutely.
what, what is it?
that is not, prison lingo, is it?
yeah, there is this superintendent’s dance, the super ball.
i do not know, and he wants to impress marge, this lady super that he is a crush on.
well, he is too shy, he does not thing he is good enough to dance with girls yet.
aww, man, now we will not be bank buddies!
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!
like-like when I am doing something exciting and i do not want to get too excited, i just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah chandler!
no-no, thank you.
all right, I am here, let us ahh, get this over with.
whoa-whoa, do not we need to do some kind of preparation first?
like ahh, get really drunk?
no, it is okay, but if I am marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
come on man, you are not a potato.
come on treeger, do not say that.
you just ahh, you just need more practice.
here, come on, let us ahh, let us try it again.
come on.
(they start dancing again) plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.
i mean, y’know, I am not really that comfortable dancing with a—(treeger throws him) we-he!!
hey!
ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
(he walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)
what?
no i did not.
no, I am not!
and it was not a hop it was a pademarie.
all right, well maybe I am enjoying it a little bit.
i mean I am getting pretty good at it.
hey-hey, hold on, this is not some kind of like girly dance.
all right, it is like a sport, it is manly!
all right.
i do not know how to lead.
what?!
(to mr. treeger) so you ah, ready for our last practice?
look, you want to use our place?
we did it!!
i know, it was amazing!
i mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
oh well, okay, good luck.
unless you want to practice the foxtrot again?
or-or the tango?
okay.
go get ‘them treeger.
(intrigued) really?
no, I am good.
(to rachel) do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
oh!
hey rach, listen umm… i got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
ooh, great!
thanks!
you sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I will tell ya… hey, y’know what?
why do not i take you out?
yes i do!
and we are going to go out, we are going to have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out… I will be fun.
no, I am picking you up for our date.
these are for you.
(hands her some flowers.)
and, a brownie!
(hands her a bag with the brownie in it.)
well, half a brownie.
actually, it is just bag.
it is been a long walk from the flower shop and i was startin’ to feel faint so… hey come on now, this is a real date.
uh, so…nice place you got here.
foosball, huh?
pizza box.
oh, a subscription to playboy, my kind of woman.
i would like to meet him.
he sounds like a stand up guy.
ah… hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?
oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
no-no-no-no, he is not!
no!
why are you trying to ruin the game?
come on!
y’know what?
bring her both, and I will have the same.
(the waitress leaves.)
oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff.
okay?
we are on a date.
no!
no.
umm, just myself and if they do not like me for—(laughs.)
I am sorry i could not even get through that.
oh alright.
umm, well, okay, i usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
well it does when you combine it with, "this is so embarrassing, i just want to have a normal life!"
oh okay, how about this one.
i was going to wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you are so beautiful…i do not think i can.
alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.
that is your move?
boy rach, you are lucky you are hot.
(exasperated) queens.
yeah, with my mom.
yeah, not so much with my dad.
i do not know.
i guess there is just always been this distance y’know—i mean we both try to pretend it is not there, but it is.
yeah, it is.
it is really tough.
y’know sometimes i think—wow!!
nice move!
"where did you grow up," it is so simple!
yeah.
yes i am!
again so simple!
oh come on!
just pick one!
between monica, phoebe, chandler, and ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
chandler?
me too!
hey rach, can i just say i think this is the best date i ever had!
i never laughed so hard—did you see the wine come out of my nose?
i got to say, i never knew i could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
huh.
huh.
ah!
okay, well then you do not judge me.
I am going to suck on the cellophane from the brownie i had before.
(they both do as they planned.)
ah, well, if i want the girl to kiss me, first thing i do is make my lips look irresistible.
now you can not tell anyone, but uh…i put on shiny lip balm.
yeah, like a moth to a flame, I am telling ya.
okay all right, so now you go.
why not?
more embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!
(rachel just looks at him.)
i did not say raspberry before did i?
all right just-just tell me rach, just tell me!
(stunned and turned on) yeah.
why—yeah, that would work for ya… oh.
(she kisses him.)
yeah.
(she goes into her room.)
me to.
(he then starts to freak out.)
hey!
oh yeah, i still can not believe you have not seen cujo.
what is wrong with you?
have you ever tried to sit through citizen kane?
oh yeah?
all right, let us do it tonight.
oh right!
yeah.
oh my god!
you did too?
it totally freaked me out, what was that?!
oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
yeah me too, all night.
yeah well that is because uh…i stayed in my room.
yeah, you do not want to look in my hamper.
no-no!
I am fine.
it is just… hey, can i ask you something?
have you ever looked at someone that you have known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?
yeah.
yeah, that…that is exactly it.
you are right.
yeah.
(deadpan) ooh!
yeah.
so yeah, so you know exactly what I am talking about.
oh yeah, sure.
(she gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and joey watches her go.)
ehhh.
(incredulous) alone?!
hey, did you get to the part where they are trapped in the car and cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?
oh uh, it did not work out.
oh uh, okay.
yeah.
oh sure, yeah, why not?
(sits on the arm of the chair.)
all right, i know!
i know.
yeah, it will be okay.
terrified.
(but for a totally different reason.)
hey!
I would be lying if i said i have not thought about it myself.
chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong.
good...(he winks)...but wrong.
aww, i do not know monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
and i think he would tell you it was a mistake.
oh...how much?
two thousand dollars!?
what do you think i am?
i soap opera star!?
that is right i am!
(opens drawer and rummages through it.
rachel enters) oo...what is in the bag?
oh...baby-proofing... why is this such a big deal now?
y'know, when i was a kid it was like.. "whoops!
joey fell down the stairs!"
or er.. "whoops!
joey electrocuted himself again!"

(shrugs) (to himself) i am on fire!

oh no no no no no... it was not... it was not because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
something personal.
boob job.
well it is...it is not that crazy okay?
making them smaller, that would be crazy.
rach?!
(he walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) rachel!!!!?
(he walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover.
it will not come up.)
so i can not do anything i like????
because she is!
mmmm hmm!

ah hah!

better take all i can carry.
who knows when I will be able to get in here again!
(entering with phoebe) come on pheebs!

hurry!
hurry!
hurry!
hey!
ross and rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
is not that why you guys are here?
well!
what happened?!
did we miss it?
mornin’ pheebs.
(sits down.)
well, my movie has officially been canceled.
nah, I am too depressed to eat.
I will probably eat in like 5 minutes.
so i guess I will just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?
i do not need that anymore.
i do not want to drive all the way back by myself, i get so lonely.
(gets an idea.)
oh—ooh!
how about you come with me?
it will be great!
we-we could talk, and play games!
huh?
this could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
sure?
hey.
where is the waitress?!
I am starving!
oh, here is where i win all my money back!
(gets up and heads for the buffet table with chandler in tow.)
sure!
what is up?
(he grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs.
chandler just stares at him and joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)
oh my god!
that is huge!
(hugs him.)
wait a minute, why come i was not invited?
and who was going to be your best man?
do not say, "ross."
do not say, "ross."
oh!
tell her she is not marriage material.
girls say it to me all the time!
and believe me, if she is anything like me, she is just going to be relieved.
they let you get married when you are drunk!
most people who get married in vegas are drunk!
an annulment?
ross!
i do not think surgery’s the answer here.
(wakes up) what?!
all right.
all right.
really?
i do not… (starts singing) i want to rock and roll all night!
(falls asleep.)
(to himself) man, this is a long drive!
are my eyes open?
no!
(he opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
do not you think i asked him that before he got in?!
ooh, I will play!
I will play!
come on pheebs!
i can not take this anymore!
let-let me make it up to you.
huh?
(starts singing.)
ground control to major tom.
commencing countdown, engines on.
take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
pheebs, i am so sorry!
i know i promised you a fun road trip with your friend and i did not deliver.
but-but-but now i know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship!
so, so, so i will strive to-to stay awake for as long as i know you.
well, thank you.
so, can we play 20 questions now?
I have got a really good one!
I have been thinking about it since kansas.
yes.
that is incredible!
you are the master!
what are you doing?
i can fix it.
hold on.
(he goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) look out.
look out.
(pries at the door a little bit.)
I am not finished.
man, this is bad!
and I have had my share of bad reviews.
i still remember my first good one though.
(quoting) "everything else in this production of our town was simply terrible.
joey tribbiani was abysmal."
yeah!
yeah monica!
you listen to me, okay?
and I am not just saying this because I am your friend, I am sayin’ it ‘because it is the truth.
you are food is abysmal!
(entering) hey uh monica, i can not remember.
did we say we were going to meet here or at the movies?
okay, I will see you there.
(starts to leave) sure, i can hang out ‘til i have to meet ya.
(to chandler) what uh—how come you are not going?
i thought you already have a job.
wow!
how do you know how to do that?!
what is it?
you cooked him?
either eat it, or be in it.
thata girl!
huh?
we should get out of here; there is a new class comin’ in.
hi.
when you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
cheese makes me thirsty.
all right.
i can an a?
in-in school?
(to joey) hey, I am a dork.
yeah!
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
i do not want to go.
I am having fun.
hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it is time to go, it is time to go.
(starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)
well i had a great time!
learned how to bake, ate great food, that is the first a I have gotten since seventh grade, and i did not have to sleep with the teacher this time.
what the hell!
yeah, this was a stupid idea.
(exits.)
(coming in from his bedroom) what is that?
maybe he found you flip-flop.
whoa!
is this porn?
what did i do?
i must have hit something on the remote.
no, we did not even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.
maybe we should not pay our gas bill?
(stops and thinks about what he just said.)
(to chandler) why would he turn off the tv?
(chandler shrugs.)
yeah, so no one touches the remote.
and no one touches the tv!
imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
hey.
pheebs!
you are blocking the porn!
look out!
yeah right.
yeah, he likes porn.
hey!
yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
you play hard to get.
then you go to tokyo.
way to be strong, man!
oh yeah, sure, that makes sense.
yeah.
‘because you already told her you love her and she did not say it back, then she called you and told you that there is another guy, so yeah, go to london that will scare her!
ross!
ross!
if you are going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those toblerone bars?
(chandler nods his head no.)
(pause) nothing.
no, nothing.
hey.
same kind of thing happened to me!
woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
noo!
nothing!
i think you are right.
one.
that is kind of nice.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah!!
hey, great!
all right!
what?
no, no, no!
no, no... no... no, no... no, too much is changing, okay?
first, phoebe getting married (to phoebe) congratulations!
(pointing to monica and chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs... well, it comes and goes.
i would not trust it.
no, no, no.
my hugs are reserved for people staying in america.
hey!
no!
get your france-going-arms away from me.
(he walks out, and rachel follows him) hey phoebe.
I am just mad at my agent.
there is a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i did not even be put up for it!
she would better have a good reason.
well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I am want to hear it, because she keeps doing this.
ok. why?
i love that saying!
hello?
i was just going to call you!
that is weird.
yeah, actually i am!
that is it?
you know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
no, no, look.
all I am saying is that you are my agent, ok?
and you are not getting me into any auditions and I am tired of it.
I am saying that… (pause).
this is not working for me anymore, ok?
estelle, you are fired.
goodbye.
(he hangs up the phone).
yeah, i just… i just feel bad about firing estelle.
this is got to be killing her.
i do not know.
she is got to be taking it hard, i was like her only client.
except for this guy who eats paper.
and I am guessing he eats more money than he makes.
look, i know she is not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years.
I am going to call her and hire her again.
why?
(impressed) you blow me away.
i promise.
and that means, never having to give a reason.
(phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves) oh my god.
(still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) hello?
estelle?
(still scared) ok-ay.
i just, i can not believe you are calling me?
no, no, no!
(starts looking around the room, terrified) do not drop by, do not drop by!
can i ask you something?
uhm, what is it like there?
thanks for everything estelle.
bye.
(hangs up and reads the phone display) "out of area".
boy, I will say.
thank you all for coming.
we are here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (joey looks at the photograph) ..inside.
as estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.
(joey looks for his notes.
the man next to him is chewing something.)
dude, where is my speech?
(the man swallows something and looks at joey.)
that is entertaining.
al zebooker everybody.
(he applauds and al shows that there is nothing left in his mouth.)
say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game.
fifty-six!
hey!
how is new england not a state?
huh?
they have a sports-team!
46. wow!
who is well educated now, mr. i-forgot-ten-states?
(gets up) all right.
do not look at my list, ross, because there is a lot on there that you do not have.
but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
do not worry, chandler, it is not a globe of the united states.
what the hell is in there?
yeah that dog left!
(interrupting him) do not do it!
told ya.
(waves bye-bye.)
look, chandler, i told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing.
it is like ross not likin’ ice cream.
half hour.
(rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you?
all right?
because if he does not like you, this is all a moo-point.
yeah, it is like a cow's opinion.
it just does not matter.
it is moo.
fine!
take their advice.
no one ever listens to me.
when the package is this pretty, no one cares what is inside.
(through the window) all right, he likes you back!
huh?
told ya, you should go for it!
(realizes what he said) street noise drowned any of that out?
(rachel moves madly towards him) no, all right, i see you later, okay... (turns away embarrassed) (entering) okay, I am in my sweat pants.
bring on the food!
(sees that chandler has a worried look on his face) what is the matter?
so?
bring the dog back, you are a hero.
chandler, it is like a big gerbil.
ross, you need some help?
(sits down next to ross) first of all, utah?
dude, you can not just make stuff up!
hey!
tag's still talking to the police.
if you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
oh no-no-no-no-no-no-no!
he went over to ross' to bring the dog back here!
you think?
vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
(he goes into a song and dance number.)
whadja think?
c'mon, you guys, it was not that bad.
it was better than that thing i did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
the estelle leonard talent agency.
wow, an agency left me its card!
maybe they want to sign me!
who is rick?
i could not do it.
when I am with a woman, i need to know that I am going out with more people than she is.
(on phone) uh huh.. uh huh... oh my god!
okay!
okay, I will be there!
(he hangs up and to all.)
that was my agent.
(he tosses and catches the phone.)
my agent has just gotten me a job...in the new al pacino movie!
can you believe this?
al pacino!
this guy's the reason i became an actor!
"I am out of order?
pfeeeh.
you are out of order!
this whole courtroom's out of order!"
"just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in!"
...I am his (mumbles) ...I am his butt double.
'kay?
i play al pacino's butt.
alright?
he goes into the shower, and then- I am his butt.
c'mon, you guys.
this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that is big!
okay, okay, fine!
make jokes, i do not care!
this is a big break for me!
here.
i need to borrow some moisturizer.
whaddya think?
today's the big day!
thank you!
(he goes into the bathroom.)
uh, listen, i just want to thank you for this great opportunity.
me?
right.
okay.
losing the robe.
(he takes off the robe.)
and the robe is lost.
well, I am- I am showering.
oh.
well, the way i see it, the guy's upset here, y'know?
i mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... i think his butt would be angry here.
i was going for quiet desperation.
but if you have to ask... nope.
i got fired.
yeah, they said i acted too much with it.
i told everybody about this!
now everybody's going to go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and... my mom will.
y'know, I have done nothing but crappy plays for six years.
and i finally get my shot, and i blow it!
hard to tell, i was naked.
yeah?
that is so nice!
(they hug.)
(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?
(phoebe and mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.)
have you not talked about it yet?
(they say nothing now, but smile) am i making you uncomfortable?
(smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to mike) if you were bigger you would hit me, huh...?
aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar) (sitting at his table) oh, i know it... it is amazing these little things open doors... huh!
(mimes opening a door with his own keys, phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
ooh.
i-i do not know chan.
I am not so good with remembering lines.
i know, right?
(chandler has really big eyes, and nods) wh... wh... why are we doing this?
seriously?
she actually said that?
nooooo!
being funny is your thing!
without that, you just got "lame with women".
(sees monica) fire trucks!
(chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to monica who does not understand what is happening.
then he turns back to joey, who says "you are welcome" without a sound) hey!
(looks surprised) really...?
guys do that...?
that is... weird... that is like a woman wanting to be a... uhm... a penis model.
(monica can not believe what is she is hearing and ross pats joey on the back.)
anyway, hey... did you tell chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you have ever met?
really?
do you not know chandler?
so what?
being funny is chandler's thing... you know, like ross's thing is... (he can not come up with anything) ...no... (he just can not seem to grasp it) monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay.
because he is feeling like... (the door opens and chandler walks in with a pizza) heeeyy!
hey!
yeah.... not knowing when to shut up... yeah!
allright!
hey, hey ross.
check it out!
sandy taught me hot-cross buns.
noooo... three blind mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder) me!
I am up for puppets!
i want to be mr. wigglemunch.
(and makes a "there" nod to ross) (kind of emotional) i am learning so much from you.
allright.
see you later!
(to monica) did that guy really make that joke?
wow!
you blow my mind... aaahh... how much do i owe you?
it is like the cheapest college ever.
ok, you know what blows my mind?
women can see breasts any time they want.
you just look down and there they are.
how you get any work done is beyond me.
no plans, huh?
why do you have to break up with her?
be a man, just stop calling.
my god, angela.
no, yeah, no, ok, but not yet.
i do not want to seem too eager.
one mississippi, two mississippi, three mississippi.
that seems pretty cool.
(he walks over to her) hey, angela.
you look good.
you do not say.
bob?
who the hell's bob?
come on, we were great together.
and not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
what?
fine, fine, so, why do not the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight?
you know, as friends?
you know, you and bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, monica.
monica, I am tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
come on.
this guy's great.
his name's bob.
he is angela's... brother.
he is smart, he is sophisticated, and he has a real job.
me, i go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but bob is... what?
eww!
look, I am asking a favor here.
if i do this for her brother, maybe angela will come back to me.
(proud) i know, but, i made a huge mistake.
i never should have broken up with her.
will you help me?
please?
yep.
which what?
no, but he is... oh my god.
i suddenly had the feeling that i was falling.
but I am not.
so, you and angela, huh?
you are a lucky man.
you know what i miss the most about her?
that cute nibbly noise when she eats.
like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
yeah, but it is not going to last.
she is too much for me in bed.
sexually.
what?
come on, they are close.
oh, like you have never gotten a little rambunctious with ross.
well, who is to say what is true?
i mean... all right, look, I am not proud of this, ok?
well, maybe i am a little.
ow!
wait, wait, wait.
you want him, i want her.
he likes you.
yeah.
I am thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
excellent.
(to phoebe) look at you.
since when do you roller blade?
cool.
well, you might want to make a little extra, y'know you will probably be hungry after the sex.
hey.
check the freezer.
if there is none in there, then we are probably out.
are you just getting in from work?
it is late.
i discovered I am able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
oh, i was reading it last night, and i got scared, so.
well, safer.
y'know, i mean i never start reading the shining, without making sure we have got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
have not you ever read the same book over and over again?
the question should be rach, what is not so great about the shining.
okay?
and the answer would be: nothing.
all right?
this is like the scariest book ever.
i bet it is way better than that classic of yours.
all right, you got it.
okay.
ah, now rach, these ah, these little women.
how little are they?
i mean, are they like scary little?
these little women.
wow!
oh yeah!
amy just burned jo’s manuscript.
i do not see how he could ever forgive her.
but jo’s got a crush on laurie.
(ross nods his head) oh.
you mean it is like a girl-girl thing?
‘because that is the one thing missing from the shining.
no wonder rachel had to read this so many times.
(noticing chandler) what are you doing?
(he pushes chandler back to his side of the couch) get back over on your side of the... (sees robert in all his glory) hello!!
(to robert) hi, I am joey, we have not met.
hey robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
hey!
(starts to laugh.)
how is it going?
hey, rach, how you doing with the shining?
oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub... all right I will talk in code.
(to ross and chandler) remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank.
oh no-no-no, no, the end when jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away.
aww!
hey!
mine was by accident!
all right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
beth, beth dies?
is that true?
if i keep reading is beth going to die?
then why would you say that?!
beth is really, really sick.
jo’s there, but i do not think there is anything she could do.
yeah.
(nodding his head) okay.
they do!
come on rach!
look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
(screaming) why god?!!
why?!!
we had a deal!!
let the others grow old!
not me!!
(he buries his head in phoebe’s lap for comfort.)
(screaming) and now chandler!
we are all gettin’ so old!
(looking up) why are you doing this to us?!
(turns away crying.)
yeah, you are roommate is a soap opera star.
hey, what is the horsepower on this thing?
but it hurt’s my joey’s apple.
well actually… dude, you soooo need this car.
yep.
(starts for monica’s room, but chandler stops him.)
now that you are a couple, we do not get two presents from you guys?
will you quit hoggin’ it!
(to the waiter) hey!
are those crab cakes?
(the waiter nods) did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
yeah!!
oh, i do not know pheebs.
it will be okay.
that is not going to happen.
no.
(looks up) because we have a new deal!
like what?
hey, y’know what you guys?
i think I am going to go walk her home.
(gets up and runs out.)
pheebs!
wait up!
(she stops.)
listen uh, close your eyes.
(she does so and joey passionately kisses her.)
maybe that is one thing you can cross off your list.
oh, and plus I am 1/16th portuguese.
oh, come on rach!
my turn just started!
oh.
okay.
hey, can i ride this outside?
okay!
(runs off downstairs.)
yes!
(entering, limping, and holding his arm) i do not like this anymore.
(he sits down with them in pain.)
(crying) why god?!
why are you doing this to us?!
(he buries his head in ross’s shoulder.)
all-all right!
(they run and jump in the car.)
start it up!
let us go!
no.
hey!
what is going on?
hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
hey, maybe i should stop by!
she could be a soap opera fan!
it is very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
(pointing at himself) celebrity.
(going out with the vcr in his hand) well, i guess we will never know whose it is!
(form the other side of the door) hellooo?
anybody in there order a celebrity?
guys?
everything ok?
it is me, joe...
guys!?
what is going on?
everything does not sound fine!
well, you would not let me in, so i thought you were in trouble.
but you called me 'bert'!?
that is our code word for danger!
we do not?
we really should.
from now on, 'bert' will be our code word for danger.
(quivering with anger) i did not care for that!
ok, ok!
(he leaves) i forgot my bat.
(to chandler) bert!
bert!
bert!
bert!
uhm... ok... uhm... well, yeah... you have got some nerve, coming back here.
i can not believe you never called me.
oh... yeah... probably you do not even remember my name.
it is joey, by the way.
and do not bother telling me yours, because i totally remember it... lady.
yeah!
i waited weeks for you to call me.
no, no!
do not try to turn this around on me, ok?
I am not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
really?
think about it.
come on!
you are a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh?
if i had your number, why would not i call you?
no, no, hey, no!
too late for apologies... ok?
you broke my heart.
you know how many women i had to sleep with to get over you?
(and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked) (acting sad) no!
i waited a long time, i can not wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him) laura!
(and points to her, very confident) hey!
18, uh?
(starts to prepare himself to say his "how you doing" line) what, what!?
it is for her hot friends!
and starting to think about settling down!
I would love to!
yeah!
(to phoebe) we were supposed to bring presents?
oh, yeah!
how was i supposed to know?
yeah, but for a one-year-old.
what is the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup.
just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer.
and he is standing next to this cow and the cow says "el-moo"!
(joey starts laughing) yeah... that is a funny cup!
hey mr. and mrs. geller!
let me help you with that.
oh man, this is great, uh?
the three of us together again!
you know what would be fun?
if we gave this present to emma from all of us!
hey pheebs, you know what?
i was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe i could do something for emma using my talents!
no, no, no!
my talents as an actor!
you know, i could like maybe... i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
hey, i think emma might like it!
um, my present!
actually we prepared performances.
but equally real!
(unconfidently) of k. hey, i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma’s books.
uh, why, it is a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) “riding the storm out.
coping with post-partum depression” eesh!
(he puts the book back and picks up another) “love you forever”.
love you forever.
by robert munsch.
published by firefly books.
printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in mexico.
a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I will love you forever, I will like you for always, as long as I am living, my baby you will be”.
(the picture fades and joey is now finishing the book).
and while he rocked her, he sang “I will love you forever, I will like you for always, as long as I am living, my baby you will be”.
I am so confused!
got it!
(goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) hey hey hey!
(to chandler) where do you think you are going?
alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we are going to be here for a li...(stops and thinks) wait a minute, there is a window in there!
well, that one did not have emma's face on it.
no.
ok!
(opens the door for them) nighty-night!
bye, bye.
hey, hey, hey, hey!
I am not going to mess with jack, he is a great man, he fought for our country.
(shocked) oh!
well that is it!
he is the last one to go.
I am locking you guys in.
(turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it) oh!
i forgot you used to live here!
hello?
hey!
(smiles) (smile fades) what audition?
what?
you never said anything about an audition!
a monologue?
i do not have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") i got it.
(hangs up) (announces to the room) aah!
so...
I am going to take off!
oh!
i got it!
ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten.
alright?
whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
okay, monica picks ten, i call nine!
anyone else?
or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the.. right.
ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
(they do so) come on robot!
way to go robot!
hey, good race you guys.
okay, if ross and rachel ask, I have been here the whole time.
the whole time!
(to ross and rachel) I have been here the whole time!
what is wrong with me.
it looked more delicious when it was a penis.
what?
what is going on?
oh my god!
is that why you guys had to get married?!
ah.
(to chandler) slow swimmers?
(chandler looks at him.)
i can not!
i-i do not have any other clothes here.
I am sorry!
okay?
i went down to the gift shop and it is either this or a bathrobe!
look, what is more important, the way I am dressed or me being with you on your special day?
that is better, now just bend your arms a little more.
there you go.
okay, look straight ahead.
now this time i want you to really put your ass into it.
(they do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)
i do not believe we have met, joey tribbiani.
wow, I have admired your work for years.
you-you have done some really amazing stuff.
wow dennis phillips!
that is great!
how did you guys meet?
chandler.
will you see if your mom can give my resume to dennis phillips?
‘because if i can get in a broadway show then i would have done it all, film, television, and theater.
the only think left would be radio, and that is just for ugly people.
uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
uh, i do not even really know where i left those.
sorry.
okay fine!
I am a seven!
all right, i have surprisingly small feet.
but the rest of me is good, I will show ya!
hey!
did you talk to dennis about me yet?
no-no!
no!
no!
you do not tell a broadway guy that!
now he just thinks I am a soap actor.
hey!
(clinks his glass) I would like to propose a toast.
to monica and chandler, the greatest couple in the world.
and my best friends.
now, my when i first found out they were getting married i was, i was a little angry.
i was like, (overly angry) "why god?
why?
how can you take them away from me?!"
but then i thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories.
(does a fake laugh.)
and-and there was some sad memories.
(starts to break down and cry.)
I am sorry.
and-and some scared memories—whoa!
(he jumps back, startled.)
eh?
and then, and then i realized I will always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity.
(starts to walk away, but realizes something.)
oh!
to the happy couple!
so did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
well, I would like to think there was something for everyone.
look, i know you are casting for this new show… oh, see that is where you are wrong.
whatever it is i can do it.
and if did not see it up there, just-just try me.
well I am not proud of this, but… (he turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)
shh.
shh.
do not try to talk, we will get you up to your room, we will soak your feet, you will be okay.
yeah.
tell me about it, i feel like I am holding down the fort all by myself.
yeah.
thursday?
but that�s halloween.
[it�s just] so spooky, that�s all.
i know, you-uch.
what about me, he?
only had one lunch today.
no, they�re comin�, we�re waitin� right here.
maybe we should just eat now.
wha-a how about this: another table leaves, right?
but there�s still some food left on their place, okay, what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?
but it happens?
(waiter leaves) i�m got to go to the bathroom.
if you ask me to stay, i�ll pee.
(leaves) (returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) finally you guys made it.
(looks up, turns left to phoebe�s chair) pheebs, who the hell�uhuhh!
thank you.
(stands up and kisses her lips.)
waiter!
�lright, this is going to be fast, so try to keep up: risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden chanterelles and a bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff i just said means snails.
(hope, *i* kept up.)
oh, uh, again.
can i make a special request: can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready?
appetizers, entrees, we don�t care.
that�s a great story�can i eat it?
(mumbling) never hit a woman.
never hit a woman.
ross bruises like a peach.
he bruises like a peach.
and remember whatever comes up first.
okay?
and hurry, because � son of a bitch!
why are you going?
he said, she wanted the shrew!
(runs after the waiter) (returned) no, no, it�s okay, i already told the waiter what they want.
chandler, control your woman!
(to chandler and monica) well, what is going on with you two?
so?
did have sex, right?
see ya.
well, this is just us.
do, do you going to do it now?
no-ohoh.
(the bings leave, the waiter comes) nah, just me.
all alone.
(all the food is served) dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
excellent.
the shrew in particular was exclusive.
joey!
joey.
that�s the best birthday ever.
hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
great, you can cover chandler.
come on man!
you never want to do anything since you and janice broke up.
chandler, you have to start getting over her.
all right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it will take your mind off janice, and if you do not play, everyone will be mad at you ‘because the teams will not be even.
come on.
says who?
your mom?
all right, we have to pick captains.
thank you.
(to his team) all right, huddle up, right over here.
i got it.
(catches the ball) set....hike!
haaaaa!
hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball.
yeah!
wow, your like from a whole other country.
hi-hi, I am joey.
I am sorry dutch, i did not get that last little bit.
her name is dutch, and also marklan.
mar-klan.
i think so.
thanks man, but i think it makes a stronger statement if i ask for it myself, y'know.
oh, yeah, that.
all right, means that much to ya, I will let you have her.
well i do not like to say it out loud, but, yeah!
do not feel bad man, we all have our strengths.
you are better with numbers and stuff.
fumble!
what the hell’s the matter with you?!
this is my favourite jersey.
all right, that is it.
y'know i was still going to let you have her.
but now, forget about it.
prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
pheebs, run!
after!!
it is hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to dutch girl.
what are you going to do?
okay.
here you go!
yeah, chandler finds me so intimdating that it is better if we are on the same team.
ah well, the ah, pennsylvania dutch, come from pennsylvania.
nice try.
(to margha) see the netherlands is this make believe place where peter pan and tinker bell come from.
whoa, whoa, no, no, i-I am not playing with this guy, now.
wait a minute!
wait a minute!
she obviously did not understand the question.
nice going.
you just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
this sucks, i was just up by that much!
(looking at the timer) thirty seconds left on the timer!
when they are hungry enough, they will come in.
hey.
what are you doing?
(laughs) why would you want to do that?
rach, there is a decent place to… no.
no.
no.
no.
rosita does not move.
as in rosita does not move.
the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it is at the perfect angle so you do not get any glare coming of off stevie.
(glaring at her) is there a problem?
i told you not to move it!
rach, how would you feel if say, i wanted to move you mom, and you said do not, and i did it anyway and her head fell off?
(slowly turning and glaring at her) she is not even cold yet!
that is true.
yeah, i… (shuts off the tv.)
i do not want stevie to see her like this.
no i will not.
because, i know what i like and what i do not like!
it is not the same thing!
i do not know why you say that so soon.
francette?
what is she?
a couch?
poor thing.
cut down in her prime.
well, i guess you are right.
maybe, maybe I will take her down to the incinerator.
it is going to be so said, and kind of cool.
(he goes to remove the back, but it does not come off.
so he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.)
she is heeled!
no it is not weird, it is a miracle!
oh there is!
if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
(interrupting her) can you tell me how this happened?
miracle!
someone like an…angel?
(angrily) get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
(she gets up and heads for her room.)
yeah, me too.
(he flips up his armrest in disgust.)
fine.
no.
really?
(quietly) my chair heels itself.
well, it looks like it was not heeled after all!
yeah!
so, i guess this chair is mine now!
(sits down in it and groans.)
your chair?!
so, there was no miracle?!
(sarcastic) oh no this is devastating!
my faith is shaken.
I am so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
how do you figure?
that is right!
yeah!
we are!
oh yeah.
ahhh…… (to rachel) eh?
hey!
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!!
none of that, not while you are living under my roof!
look, just because i know about you two, does not mean i like looking at it.
well, I am sorry if I am not a middle-aged black woman!
(starts for his room.)
and I am also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition!
okay, look, if i have to pretend i do not know about you two, then you two are going to have to pretend there is nothing to know about.
(from the bedroom) i can hear that!
i can still hear you!
hey!
argh-argh!!
(catches the coat.)
ooh, soft.
is this mink?
hey, ross, you are okay with that?
(after ross is gone) what is he doing?
what, emily, thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies?
no!
everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know?
emily will not let ross see rachel, we are not going to stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us!
no!
but y'know, I am an actor, I will act cool.
I will take it!
ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!
(he drapes it around his shoulders.)
enh?
all right, what do you think?
what is the matter ross?
that is way uptown!
that is like three trains away!
(phoebe pinches him.)
which is great!
i love to ride that rail!
now he is movin'?
man, what is emily doing to him?
(phoebe pinches him again.)
ow!!
he is not even here!!!
uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
yeah, you fogged danny.
dan just moved in downstairs.
yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the andes.
nice fella.
ohh.
hey, remember when i ran into this thing (the shutters that close off the kitchen.)
and it kind of knocked me out a little?
uhh, are you saying that you are not entirely happy about this?
you do have a choice!!
ross, why are you listening to her?!
are you, are you crazy?!
it is not right what emily wants you to do!
she is totally-(the gang enters behind joey and phoebe pinches him again.)-owww!!
stop pinching me!
look, now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right?
well he just told me that he is not entirely happy.
we all hate emily!
yeah!
yes!
yes!
unreasonable!
i kind of feel like it is my fault.
well, I am keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
(he glares at chandler.)
look, ross, i feel really bad.
i mean, you are going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk.
look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
hey, y'know ross, i think i kind of understand why i kind of lost it today.
yeah you see umm, well, I am an actor.
right?
so i got to keep my emotions right at the surface y'know?
see what I am saying?
i got to lot of balls in the air.
(makes like he is juggling.)
y'know what i mean?
it is tough!
guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you are alone… (thinks) I am not sure.
rachel please!!!
just have dinner with us!!!
all right, i-I am sorry.
I am sorry.
you see rach I am an actor… it is almost as if he knew.
well uh, i do not know about who is here, but i can tell you for damn sure who is not here and that is rachel!!
i think it is going okay.
looks like he is smiling.
you can totally tell!
here look, watch me.
(he stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.)
smile!
frown.
smile!
frown.
(the camera cuts to ross outside hanging up the phone.)
smile!
(ross turns around and sees joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)
what happened?
what happened?
since always.
it is like dating language.
y'know, like 'it is not you' means 'it is you'.
yeah.
cushions the blow.
"warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.
but you will have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
thanks!
let us keep going.
"i just want to go back to my cell.
because in my cell, i can smoke."
what?
whoah!
hey!
no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette.
y'miss it?
that is ridiculous!
y'okay, phoebe?
what are you talking about?
keep it!
so when do we get to meet the guy?
let it go, ross.
you can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
(shouting to chandler) chandler!
he is here!
know what was great?
the way his smile was kind of crooked.
alan.
...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?
oh, (imitating ross) "you do, do you"?
do you have any respect for your body?
(dragged in by monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) what is going on?
even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. oh, god!
(hurriedly closes his legs.)
so that is it?
it is over?
just like that?
okay!
morning, roomie!
fifth day's a charm.
hey, it is great having you back.
you know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
she is probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
no, hey, it is been great.
yeah.
and look, i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?
and even if they were not, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump... wow!
so, how are you?
really?
well, actually it... wow, really?
sure, i know lots of girls.
ooh, names?
hey.
i was just going to get something to eat.
you want something?
I am fine, I am fine, it is just, it is just weird what is happening with her and ross.
you know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
why are they doing this?
you know what is crazy?
these jars.
what is it, like two bites in here?
i know, i know.
and when they moved back in together, i figured y'know, that is where things were headed.
yes, and they should name one of their kids joey.
i may not have kids; someone is got to carry on the family name.
yeah, because it is slim pickings.
i had this date last night: yuck!
but we should probably keep it down; she is still in the bedroom.
i know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
ooh, that is a great plan!
shhh!
not so loud, we do not want to wake up, uh... hey.
all right!
who is he?
she is this really boring woman.
she is a teacher!
yeah, yeah, she is really into history and foreign movies... and oh, oh, she loves puzzles.
huh?
come on, who loves puzzles?
oh my god, you are right!
she even reads for pleasure!
what?
I am not allowed to know smart women?
i met her at the library.
i went in to pee.
well, okay, I will - I will just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
ooh...i hear that is bad.
ah, yes, the plan!
(laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like santa claus.)
yeah, you know, it is not that fun.
oh, great, pretty soon they will be back together.
hello?
emma?
hey!
hi!
how are ya?
how are ya?
where are your babysitters, huh?
why is the bedroom door closed?
you can not have s-e-x, when you are taking care of the b-a-b-i-e!
because you two were having sex!
do not you lie to me!
i could tell by chandler's hair.
(to chandler.)
you are so lazy.
can not you get on top for once?
hey!
it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room.
I am going to have to tell rachel about this.
hey, i got to!
unless... unless you name your firstborn child joey.
hey, i may never have kids, and somebody is got to carry on my family name.
(beat) (laughs.)
you almost had me.
uh-huh.
it is easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
we are geniuses!
yeah, look at them, look at them, they are really bonding.
where?
can you believe they are still not here?
i know, I am so bummed.
can we have our free crab cakes now?
we have been stood up.
(sniffles) and we want our free crab cakes.
no, look.
(shows him the magazine.)
i know, i know, but look at the knobs on her.
why?
hey, you can stay with us!
we will take care of ya!
yeah.
okay.
ross?
not a problem.
and listen, hey!
since you are going to be here for a while, why do not—i was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
hey, all right!
(to chandler) you are fake laughing too, right?
hey.
nothing.
(smiles) kind of.
dude, you should have gone out once and a while.
come on, chandler, ross is our friend.
he needs us right now, so why do not you be a grown up and come and watch some tv in the fort!
sorry.
ahhhhhhhhhh… hey!
want to play some foosball?
please?
no-no, no!
we have to move the table into my room, yeah!
because of all the boxes.
come on!
all right, i have one question.
what is the deal with this?
(imitates ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he is waving good-bye.)
no, the quiet down thing!
um-hmm!
look, i-i-i do not know how much more of this i can take!
did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with some show about bugs!
my god!
what if that had been porn?
all right, i guess i can hold out a little longer.
let us have a game.
yes!!
um-hmm.
(entering) hey!
you guys got anything to eat?
i just went down to johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we going to eat?!
umm, yum!
mine!
(he grabs it.)
oh that is mine too!
(grabs it and ross looks at him.)
I am italian!
but it is available now!
is not it?
hey, let us go look at it!
(they both jump up.)
okay!
yeah!
somebody was using his head.
hey, let us check out the rest of the place.
but hey, ross, this place is available now!
yeah.
oh, it is perfect!
he knew we were trying to get rid of him.
he knew!
(pause.)
you think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping ross get back on his feet!
yeah!
yeah!
i do not know.
maybe pizza?
oh!
oh!
hello!
(listens.)
oh yeah!
(to chandler) it is the apartment manager; ross put us down as references.
(to the apartment manager.)
ross is the greatest guy you will ever meet!
yeah, he is very reliable.
(getting up) dude, I am telling ya!
I am fine!
(he tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)
hey!
you are kidding!
but you can not stay with phoebe, ross!
we are-we are roomies!
well, we got plenty of space!
there-there is still some over there (points to where the window is but sees that there is not any space there and points towards his door.)
by-by that speaker.
please, just stay!
definitely!
all right!
dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
(joins him) i got to get one, too.
yeah, we know, but there is a baby suckin' on it.
uh, does it hurt?
chandler?
ok, i got one, i got one.
uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
monica what are you doing?
you can not go shopping with her?
what about rachel?
(a guy walks by) bijan for men?
(another guy walks by) bijan for men?
(another guy walks by) bijan for men?
(an attractive woman walks by.)
hey annabelle.
who?
what is he doing in my section?
well, he is going to.
I will see you a little later, ok?
(to the hombre man) hey, how ya doing?
listen, i know you are new, but it is kind of understood that everything from young men's to the escalator is my territory.
yeah.
bijan for men?
(to a guy) bijan for men?
(to a guy) bijan for men?
(to a woman) bijan for... (sees it is a woman and stops.)
(to annabelle who walks up.)
hey, annabelle, uh, listen, i was wondering if maybe after work you and i could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
(to a co-worker) hey, it is not the first time i lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.
(a customer walks by.)
bijan for men?
(the customer ignores him, and joey starts to chase him) bijan for men?!
what is the big deal?
(tastes the breast milk.)
yeah, it is kind of sweet, sorta like, uh... exactly.
(sitting on the otherside of the counter from chandler) give me a box a juice.
well, they switched me over to hombre.
or maybe it is because this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.
(chandler pours some juice in a glass.)
you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
i know, but, i was the best, you know?
i liked being the best.
(he downs the glass of juice in one swig.)
i do not know.
maybe i should just get outta the game.
they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
yeah i guess you are right.
I am going to do it.
(he downs the juice in one swig again.)
mornin'.
(the hombre man ignores him) i said, mornin'.
yeah, I am ready.
these new kids, they never last.
sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'.
listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now?
oh okay, okay!
one more push!
one more push!
come on honey, we are almost there!
we are almost there!
oh, i love you too.
that is always appropriate!
(back to the matter at hand) oh, okay.
one more push!
one more push!
what?
what is going on?
aaaah… really?!
oh, y’know what?
maybe uh, you…you should come to me.
I am a not, I am not wearing any bottoms.
oh my, oh my god!
mia hamm?
oh that is amazing.
(drops the sheet.)
whoa-hey-oh!
sorry!
hey ross!
the baby’s kicking!
a dreamless sleep.
well i got stuff going on in here (rubbing his belly) if you want to feel.
wow!
can i get a copy of that?
whoa, monica runs a pretty tight ship over here.
what are you doing?
why not?
i do not know.
ooh, i bet it is richard.
well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she is having her cake and eating it too.
you being the cake and richard being the too.
or!
i saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh.
y’know it would not kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy!
(he walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.)
stupid closet full of bugs!
oh hey whoa-whoa, do not worry.
okay.
when my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
absolutely.
but, we are going to stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay?
I will page ross on the way.
come on.
okay rach-rach-rach look at me, look at me, everything’s going to be fine, trust me.
okay.
take my hand.
here we go.
(rachel grabs his hand.)
oww crushing bones!
hey!
so?
so but everything is normal.
and-and there is no danger to her and the baby?
calm?!
i was not calm!
I have never been more scared in all my life!
well what do i know?!
I am not a doctor!
you sure?!
(seeing ross) oh hey-hey!
something called braxton-hicks contractions.
hey uh, what is with the candy?
oh hey, do not worry about it man.
do not worry about it, no big deal.
oh uh, hey.
not as good as this guy!
(grabs ross around the shoulders.)
he brought twizlers!
easy there captain kirk.
oh, do you have a bobby pin?
then why do you throw like one?
sure.
"monica."
uh, really good.
really good.
yeah, i should be ready to kill myself any day now.
(chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to joey.)
wow, you sure found that quick.
(he tries the pin in the lock.)
i just—i wish i did not feel this way about rachel anymore, y’know?
i wish things could go back to normal.
i mean, i love living with her and god, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now i think…i think ross feels left out.
y’know?
when i had to take rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought i was the father.
god… you should have seen the look on ross’s face.
(pause) by the way, i have no idea what I am doing here.
for all i know I am just locking it more.
oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
yeah.
oh, i just…i feel terrible.
what is going on?
pickle?
pickles make her sick.
giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
I am on it!
(takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
dude relax!
it could happen to anyone.
hey uh, can i, can i talk to you guys for a second?
uh, sit down.
i want to talk about our situation.
the thing is…because i live with rachel I am here for a lot of the stuff, okay?
(to rachel) and ross…ross is missing everything.
so… maybe you two should live together.
oh no-no, no-no i love living with you.
it just seems that…if you are going to have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.
all right now, so?
what do you think?
well, i was due.
hey.
well uh, i wanted to have a few beers, but uh, i got rid of those because rachel could not stand the smell of them.
but i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though.
and uh, it is a couple weeks past it is expiration date, so it is got a bit of a kick.
are you kidding me?
I am great!
yeah, I am uh; I am better than great.
i am good.
and now that she is gone, i can uh, i can do all this stuff around here that i could not do before.
y’know?
like umm, i can walk around naked again.
y’know?
i can uh, i can watch porn in the living room.
right?
this is uh, this is good for me.
y’know?
i like being on my own, I am uh, better off this way.
I am uh, a lone wolf.
y’know?
a loner.
alone.
all alone.
forever.
what is a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
(chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
okay, pick a card, any card.
(monica picks one) all right, now memorize it.
show to everybody.
got it?
all right, give it back to me.
(takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.
i can not tell you that, no.
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really want to know how i did it, I will show ya.
when you handed me back the card, what you did not see was, i looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.
(picks up a card and quickly looks at it) i just did it.
(does it again) i just did it, again.
here, I will slow it down so that you guys can see it.
(looks and the card in slow motion) man, i remember the first time i saw that girl katherine, after we broke up.
she was just walking with her friend donna, just laughing and talking.
god, it killed me.
sorry, i just, any excuse to tell that story y'know.... i do not know, chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘them around... chandler!
oh my god!
how many of these things did you have?
these are pure vodka.
no, only for sex.
hey!!
hey-hey-hey!
(angrily entering, to chandler) can i talk to you for a second?!
come on!!
(motions for chandler to come with him) i just got off the phone with my sister.
mary-angela.
yeah.
why do not you ask chandler, ‘because he is the one that fooled around with her.
she told me you said you could really fall for her.
now is that true?
or are you just gettin’ over janice by groping my sister.
really?
that is great!
you and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.
waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry.
what about you?
you are so the man!
(motions him to come in, and he does) now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘because my grandma does not know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off.
she was like the sixth person to spit on mussolini's hanging body.
yeah.
she is right in there.
(motions to the living room) what is going on?
what?!
how could you do that, how could you think she was mary-angela?
well, that is usually what i would do.
but i just never thought you would be on the receiving end of it.
how could you do this?!
no!
no!
no!
no, I am not going to punch chandler.
no you will not.
look he knows he did a terrible thing and i believe him, he is sorry.
but, (to chandler) you have got one more apology to make, all right, you have got to apologize to mary-angela.
all right.
cookie, now you can punch him!
all right, that is it!
he cannot do this to phoebe.
(gets up) this guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime!
(stops and turns around and asks rachel) but, is he a big guy?
do not you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
three tickets to today's rangers game!!
oh.
yeah, they are great seats too!
center ice.
so we will leave before it is over, we will be back in time.
dude, two times that happened!
right, i guess.
alright, so see you at four.
that is some gentle comedy, dude.
(he and ross leave) yeah!
oh, bob, get off the guy!
i know, yeah.
yeah.
i am sorry he is not here too, but i got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where chandler should have been) i am really enjoying nacho chair.
ohhhh!
these seats are great!
(looks at the time) wow, hey, we would better get going.
if we do not leave right now, we will be late for dinner.
i do not know... okay.
how late are we?
wow (he opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
okay.
rachel and phoebe are already there, okay?
so they probably started without us.
we could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
(he raises his hands and on his right one there is a rangers foam finger) oh, no, no, no, no, no.
you just want to put it on your hand!
you are not at thanksgiving?
we figured we could be late because you guys were going to be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls) yeah, where were you!
wait a second, wait a second, where have i seen that cowgirl outfit before... (realizing) oh!
that is alicia mae emory's outfit!
all right.
hey rach, while you are in there, throw something on alicia mae.
no.
here (he tears off the pocket from ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
(whispering) who do you think its from?
i hate that thing, it is like a... bolt of lightning.
(smiling from ear to ear) ah-haah!
i win!!
that is fire.
beats everything.
ooh!
well played, phoebe buffay, well played.
i had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
(ross picks it up) (holds his fist up) water balloon!
(he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to ross) (to ross) just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know?
look them in the eye.
i know i can get them to forgive us.
I am telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out.
he stares at ross like this without blinking) i can do it.
oh!
it all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing... (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at monica and chandler as he did with ross earlier in the hall) hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
come on you guys, we want you to know we are (his eye widen even more) very very sorry.
(monica and chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) right guys?
(smiling) now let us not ruin this day.
you worked so hard.
let us move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
hey!
I am getting a little tired of this okay?
we said we are sorry.
it is thanksgiving for pete's sakes!
a day of forgiveness!
(to ross, mouthing) do not make me come up there!
fine!
let us just go.
i do not need your stupid dinner.
sorry!
yeah!
you three have a nice thanksgiving.
yeah!
you, chan, and the vein!
ha!
oh-oh!
I am stuck!
no seriously...
I am really wedged in here.
(in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh stop!
stop!
I am worried about damaging my head.
alright, hurry up, you got to do something.
i just want to say that I am sorry i referred to the vein as a seperate person... oh, that smells good!
okay.
it is not working.
well hurry, i can not feel my ears!
interesting... i left them at the park.
it is really starting to hurt.
ooh!
stop putting things down my pants!
yeah!
come on!
(looking at himself) man, I have got food all over me.
oh, i know how you feel... sure.
i went through the exact same thing with alicia mae emory... the waiting, the wandering... then one day... i get that call from toys "r" us... she was in stock!
yeah!
oh my god!
(to chandler) is this what it is like to be you?
oh, you have no idea.
and-and when we are on stage i get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it is like somebody is ripping out my heart!
uh, pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
hey, kate!
listen, i ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week... (to himself) and i ate the food, i had the fish, it was good, yeah.
it was good, yeah... oh, hey!
joey tribbiani.
(looks at her, shocked) what?!
get out of here, really?!
yeah?
they gave me the shaft all right.
well ahh, (he sees kate and the director kissing) yeah!
yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
all right.
come on baby, do not go.
please?
what do you say?
(to kate) that guy’s like a cartoon.
what do you see in him anyway?
hey, I am not interested in her sweater!
it is what is underneath her sweater that counts.
and besides, since ah, since when do you care who I am going out with?
do you want me to want you to care?
what?
come on baby, do not go.
please?
what do you say?
hey, it is going to be all right.
what?
oh, yeah, with the mug painting.
yeah.
i was so listening to that.
but ah, y'know what, i think i kind of need to work on my stuff tonight.
okay.
(he gives her a peck on the cheek) okay.
(to kate) ah, are you okay?
i do not know.
how do you mean?
maybe he could slip her the tongue.
yeah, yeah, and then adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
and then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
something like that?
yeah.
(to ross) hey.
(to monica) hey.
hey.
no-no, things ah, finally happened with kate.
oh, it was so amazing.
after the (pause) love making... yep.
i just, i just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out.
and then i knew she was dreaming ‘because, ‘because her eyes keep going like this.
(he closes his eyes and moves them around, kind of like he is been processed by the devil, or something.)
hey.
so i ah, talked to lauren, kind of told her how things were with us.
did you ah, did you talk to marshall?
y'know, about what happened with us.
what are you talking about?
it was a big deal.
i mean, come on you can not tell me last night did not mean something to you.
i-i was there, you are not that good an actress.
nooo.
hi, lauren.
(on phone) well, so anyway beth, what I am saying is i should have considered your feelings before i went home with you that night.
I have ah, I have recently learned what is it like to be on your side of it, and I am sorry.
so, do you think you can forgive me?
(listens) great.
thanks.
okay, bye.
(he sits down and crosses out something, and dials the phone again.)
hello, jennifer?
(listens) oh hi, mrs. loreo, is jennifer there?
(listens) oh, she is not home huh?
(listens) well ah, actually i kind of need to talk to you too.
wow, pheebs!
that sounds great!
hey!
ooh-ooh, pheebs, you want a strong name?
how about, the hulk?
oh, want a good name, go with joey.
joey’s your pal.
joey’s your buddy.
"where is everybody?"
"well, they are hanging out with joey."
oh well, hey, joey’s loveable too!
but the thing about joey is, if you need him, he will be there.
what do ya say?
what do ya say?
i knew i should not have mentioned it!
that is what i wanted to name my kid!
hey!
no, but I am going to!
oh!
oh-oh, you got to pick joey!
i mean, name one famous person named chandler.
someone you did not make up!
yeah, that guy really hurt us.
all right look man, i did not want to bring this up, but chandler, is the stupidest name i ever heard in my life!
it is not even a name; it is barely even a word.
okay?
it is kind of like chandelier, but it is not!
all right?
it is a stupid, stupid non-name!
I am sorry man, i did not—I am-I am sorry.
I am sorry.
(goes over and comforts him.)
so i guess it is joey then!
(answering the door.)
hey, how did you do that?!
come on in.
(he brings them inside.)
dude, i am sorry about what i said!
it is not that bad.
so, you are just bing?
no way are you cool enough to pull of clint.
see you later, gene.
what is up with gene?
nah, you are not tall enough to be a mark, but you might make a good barney.
ohh!
(realises it was all a trick to get phoebe to name the baby chandler.)
ross, did you really read all these baby books?
hey ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?
(measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) this is your baby.
(in baby-like voice) hi daddy!
(in baby-like voice) how come you do not live with mommy?
(pause; shows ross less than amused) how come mommy lives with that other lady?
(pause; ross still looks less than amused; joey smiling) what is a lesbian?
(playfully hits ross) i love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... need a new table.
that is the rule.
how did you get to that?
you knew about that?
ok, ok, how about if we split it?
yeah why not?
why, are you moving out?
you would tell me if you were moving out right aw, i know all about kip!
well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me?
so what is it going to be?
(monica whispers in joey's ear.
ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest) or an uncle... hey, chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
feminist issue.
that is where i went!
will you pick one, just pick one!
here, how about that one?
(points to a table) so what, like people are going to come in and think, "uh-oh, I am outside again?"
of course!
i do not know, birds just do not say, "hello, sit here, eat something."
all right, how about the ladybugs?
fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
who cares, we will eat at the sink!
come on, let us play!
no-no, she kicked our butts.
you could be on the olympic standing-there team.
yes, now is when you swoop!
you got to make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she is got to know that you are everything he is not!
you are like, like the anti-paolo!
wha- hey!
uh, it is 2:30 in the morning!
oh yeah!
(hearing rachel and jumping up with his plate) oh god!
that is rachel!
no-no, i can not!
i can not!
not after the other night, it is just it is…too weird, okay?
do not tell her I am here!
(turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.)
do not eat that!
(runs to the bathroom as rachel enters.)
yeah, a naked bagel game?
(picks up his dropped bagel.)
(to chandler) dude, i do not know.
that is a pretty small hole.
i can not!
y’know?
you guys do not know what it is like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
all right so, so what do i do?
yeah.
okay.
(goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.)
whoa!
(stops.)
i almost forgot this was on your… hey.
hi.
(entering) hey!
so you uh, have a…big work problem?
huh.
okay.
(awkward silence.)
so uh, i think I am going to take off.
yeah?
yeah?
what?!
oh my-oh my god!
what he wants to buy your baby?!
that is crazy!
okay, how did this even happen?
man!
when you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby i figured it was something about maternity leave.
do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
(entering) hey!
not a problem.
oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
let us just say i took care of it.
do not worry!
do not worry.
i just told him, very nicely, "you do not go buying people’s babies, so back off!!"
what?!
why?!
and you could not think of anything else?!
you lied to me!
so?
what-what-what happened?
i know.
i know.
hey you are right.
yeah, it is kind of been like us again a little bit.
me too.
i mean i…have not thought at all about how i put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you did not feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
oh, nothing, no.
it is an acting exercise, I am practising my fake laugh.
what-what is so funny?
yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
well, have-have you told him how you feel?
so, we are walking down the street and i turn to you and i say, “hey, let us go hang out at totally nude nudes,” remember?
and then, and then, you turn to me and say, “nah, let us just hang out at your place.” well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
yeah, come on, think about it.
you are 18, okay, she is 44, when you are 36, she is going to be 88. look, the point is, there is a lot of women out there you have not even had sex with yet!
yeah, in a poem maybe.
now, wh-what, what is that like?
(to ross) why can not i find that?
well, i want it!
i do not know, maybe i can not.
i mean, maybe there is something wrong with me.
then you hold on to it!!
all right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
(hugs him) i could not help it, there love is so pure.
hey!
hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
every night!!
(he is recorded his voice on the tape) joey’s your best friend.
you want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday.
(he laughs) and you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
hey ross, check this out!
(he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, i can not do that!
hey!
(he throws the basketball against a table again) (he stops chandler from posting the message) no, no, no... what do... you can not do that to him!
dude!
(he opens his arms to receive the ball from ross' hands) (after ross leaves the room) aaand send!
(he hits the send button) oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye!
chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near emma's cot) rach... what is hugsy doing in the crib with emma?
(he looks puzzled) (still very puzzled) oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it is a stuffed animal... you know... it is for kids... not for adults... i know that!
rachel... let us be clear on this, ok?
i do not love hugsy.
i like him a normal amount... why would not she?
he is a wonderful person!
look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.
(he picks up hugsy) it is okay, emma, you stay asleep.
(emma cries) it is okay, it is okay rach, it is me.
put down the scrunchy.
well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy.
(placing hugsy back in the crib) there you go sweetie... (to emma) this is not over.
hey, look who is here!
it is joey, and he brought home a friend.
no, no, it is not a girl, it is... a brand new hugsy!
no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh?
the other hugsy, i do not know, i guess I will just take it back.
make the transfer!
(she does so) oh, no do not worry about that, i swallowed that years ago.
but he is the same.
but he is the same.
he is the same!
(to the new hugsy) you are not the same!
original or crappy?
no, sorry have not seen him.
it is monica, ok?
alright!!
fine!
it is original hugsy!
no, now i know that emma wants him but he is mine and i need him.. ... she is being unreasonable!
it does?
really?
she... she loves me?
ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... .
if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him.
look forget it forget it... i can not do it.
how do you think i got him in the first place?
done!
i did it!
heh, who is stupid now?
(he smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)
well, i know what I am giving you for christmas.
ohhh!
hey, mon!
I am not doing anything, why do not you fire me?
good enough to get fired.
hey!
that must be why i got fired last week!
does this orson wells guy direct burger king commercials?
what are you talking about?
lots of things rhyme with rachel.
bagel.
mail.
jail.
bail.
able.
may-pole.
sure!
where are the seats?
now, wait a second!
you make food and robots?
yeah, lady, i do!
i got a problem with that!
oh, what are you going to do?
you are going to fire me?
(entering) hey!
(checks his watch) damn!
(runs out to work) (entering from the dining room) hey.
hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket?
(sees there is a burn spot on it) you got it!
oh-oh!
(he starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)
it is still a tiny bit on fire there.
yeah.
listen uh, I would prefer it if you did not call me joey.
since i do not know anyone here, i thought it would be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
(opening an envelope) there is like-there is like 300 bucks in this one!
no madam.
i am so-so-so sorry.
i was going to do it!
really!
but i was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and i was thinking, "wow!
it is been a long time since i had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can not) 327 + 238 dollars!"
and i got to pay rent!
look, how-how about this?
you do not fire me, instead i stay here, i gain their trust, and they will start listening to all the nice things I have been saying about you.
well nothing yet, they really hate you and i want to fit in.
(interrupting) hey!
chef geller!
y’know that little speech you made the other day?
well i got a problem with it!
you bet i do!
i just ah, was not listening then, that is all.
what are you going to do?
you are going to fire me?
well i guess i should have thought about my wife and kids before i talked back to chef geller!
yep!
looks like it is going to be a leeeeean christmas at the dragon house this year.
(leaving) lean-lean-lean!
i can not believe she would say that too you.
(interrupting him) uh ross!
are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
well, I have just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that did not have naked chicks on it.
oh-ooh-ooh!
y’know what is a good visual aide?
why not?!
hey!
any good mail?
ooh, it is probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I am kind of….
hmm that is weird.
i do not remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
let me see that!
(reads it) oh, i can not believe this!
this sucks!
when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know?
and it would not matter.
now i got to be careful?!
all right well, i guess i got to go get a job.
I am going to go see my agent.
(mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross the street.
(turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)
(entering) hey estelle, listen… what are you talkin’ about?
i never left you!
you have always been my agent!
yeah!
estelle, you got to get me some work.
i-i lost my health insurance.
why?
bastard!
(in obvious pain) hey!
so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I will have my health insurance back in no time.
what?!
nothing!
well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, have not been able to stand up since.
but um, i do not think it is anything serious.
no way!
‘kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it is going to be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
(rolls over and shows chandler.)
why did i have to start working out again?
(looks at the weights he was using.)
damn you 15s!
dude!
hernia operations cost like, a lot probably.
besides it is getting darker and more painful, that means it is healing.
thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i do not want that hanging over my head.
okay?
besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want!
yeah, I am thinking I will probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
hey!
look, I am telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here (he puts his hand down his pants, like al bundy on married…with children always used to do.)
it does not hurt that bad.
sure, now I am scared.
yeah, but i do not want to die!
(in a gravely, painful voice) okay.
"hey, timmy, I have got a surprise for you."
oh yeah, sure, no problem, I will just—hold on one second.
(he turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.)
(in a relaxed voice.)
"hey timmy, I have got a surprise for you!"
so that is why i feed my dog purina one!
pick up a bag today!
(he turns, looks at the bag and realizes he will not be able to pick it up.)
exactly.
or, i could just point to it!
huh?
blah, blah, blah, purina one, point to a bag today.
(she just looks at him.)
i did not get it, did i?
yeah, okay.
(leaves) hi.
I am joey tribbiani; I am here to audition for (groans) man.
yes!
(barely audible through the pain) thank you.
yeah!
and hey, thanks for coming with me.
and thanks again for helping me take a shower.
(to the director) hiya!
hi alex!
(to the director) and uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants.
(holds them both up.)
"take could care of your momma son."
(alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.)
"take could care of your momma son."
(alex does nothing.)
"come on son!
your momma’s good people!"
ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if i, if i scream right up until you say action?
okay.
(starts screaming.)
(he stops screaming at action) "take good care of your momma son."
(again alex does nothing.)
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!
you just take a big, big swing.
now, do not hold back.
(he dons his protective helmet (why, i have no clue.)
and phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as chandler and monica enter.)
hey-hey-hey!
hey!

i didn�t feel a thing !
hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around yeah, yeah.
hey, they totally match!
they look great!
they look great!
how you doing!
thank you so much.
listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
comb my eyelashes.
hey!
ha, oh, of course.
your eyebrows look weird.
(talking to a pineapple in his hand) god, you are beautiful...why are we fighting this?you know you want it to happen as much as i do.
i want you.i need you.let me make love to you.
oh, ehm...I am...I am rehearsing my lines.they gave me a big romantic story on days of our lives.
it is the first time my character's got one.
I am so nervous, you know, i really want it to be good!
yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) oh, hey!d'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I am doing ok?
yeah!hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
right!
(he starts to ape her)"oh my god, is this the men's room?
oh, i feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"
(he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts) i do not know, but one of the extras sure did!
(pause) hey, listen rach.
thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
also so gay!
well, at the christmas party him and santa did some definitely gay stuff!
oh, wish me luck!
rach, i got to say...if you were not here wondering if these guys were gay i do not know if i could do this!
hey!
oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they are not as good as me!
ow, I am just going over the script now!
you want to read lines with me?
oh, all right, i can ask monica.
right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
what?
ah, rach, it does not say that!
but, but.. hey!
(touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) oh man!
i thought i got it all!
i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
and i could not find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...?
turns out very!
what?
oh...i do not think it is going very well... well, I am feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow... a little.
yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that I am in love with olivia.
so...I have never played that!
uh...well...just once...with you... (looks at her for a moment) what the hell are you talking about??
(approvingly) oh!
ok, yeah, i think i can do that.
yeah ok, there is this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can not... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you did not know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
well.. hey, you know what else i could use?
there is a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she does not know he is there - which never happened with us!
and he knows he should not be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?
(in a romantic voice) and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful... (rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
(excited) thanks dude!!
!this is great!!
(leaves rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room) it is all london, baby!
here we go.
(he takes a picture of a less than enthused chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)
yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser.
you do not want to lose that.
ohh!!
(runs to his room.)
woo-hoo!!
london baby!
(louder) london baby!!
bye, pheebs!

(and rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)
come on!
do something!
okay, here!
(gives him the camera.)
i want to be the on camera guy.
all right, first stop, westminster abbey.
(joey folds out his "pop-up" map of london.
all of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)
it is london, baby!
all right, the hotel’s here.
(points to the map.)
wait.
no, we want to go… no.
i know.
(sets the map down.)
I am going to have to go into the map.
(so joey literally steps into the map.)
i got it!
(picks up the map and starts walking.)
here we go.
shhh!
(pause) man, you made me lose it!
(he goes into the map again.)
all right!
westminster abbey!
hands down, best abbey I have ever seen.
hey!
(pushes chandler in front of the camera.)
okay.
what do you think of the abbey, chandler?
really?
to what?
man, you are westminster crabby.
(he starts chasing chandler towards the abbey.)
hey!
check this out?
huh?
(joey has this big tall hat with a british flag on the front of it.)
yeah.
that is the stuff.
what do you think?
well, i like it.
here you go.
(he pays for the hat.)
oh, i embarrass you?
oh yeah?
(puts the hat on.)
if you are going to make me choose between you and the hat?
i choose the hat.
thanks.
hey.
oh.
(takes off the hat.)
sorry!
me too.
noo!!
I have had the best day ever!
dude, check this out!
sh-shh-shh!
(he motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
(on tape) okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
(on tape) oh, chandler.
that is fergie baby!!
well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right?
so, I am in my map and-and…(ross enters) hey!
wait up!
(they both run to the bathroom.)
yeah.
(pause) hey, i hope ross did not think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
(on phone) hey, pheebs!
it is joey!
that just cost me four bucks.
but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
kind of, but I have just been having way too much fun.
no, i do not think so.
who is seven?
ahh, the babies miss me?
what?
you ordered pizza without me?!
two pizzas?!
wait, well, where did you get it from?!
what is in it?
(looking up at the waiter)that is not food...no, i do not, no...(taps chandler on the shoulder.)
everything's different here...i want to go home.
i...i miss my family.
i miss the coffee house.
i can not even remember what phoebe looks like.
(pointing  at chandler.)
your different here too.
your mean in england.
(chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration.
they walk away from each other.)
hey, best man number two, joey tribbiani.
now I am not good with the jokes like chandler here.
boy...but ahh, i just want to say congratulation to the happy couple.
i first met ross in this coffee house back home...home...new york city...where everybody knows my name.
well anyway, i love you guys.
(pointing at everyone.)
but not as much as i love america.
(looking at chandler.)
could we please..go home now?
(putting his arm around her.)
I am not going anywhere, sweetheart.
hello?
hey.
i spent the night out.
i met this cute bridesmaid.
she is so... ahh pheebs, you know you are still my number one girl.
ohh great!!!
(confused.)
but, he loves emily?
okay.
hold on.
hold on.
(picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.)
rachel coming.
do...something.
right!
hey.
have you seen monica?
(with a confused look on his face.)
what?
look we have got to find her.
phoebe just called!!
rachel’s coming to tell ross she loves him!!
i know!
that is why we got to find monica!!
you know where she is?
(whispering.)
pisst, monica.
alright, we really need to start looking out for rachel.
I will cover the front door.
you watch that big hole at the back of the building and i got chandler covering ross.
okay.
(they both walk off to watch for rachel.)
hey, felicity.
yeah.
(in a new york accent.)
fuggetaboutit.
(she giggles.)
how you doin?
oh, yeah.
(smiling.)
ohh great!!
(putting the phone to his ear.)
hello.
(he begins to escort her down the aisle.)
no, but it is okay.
she just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
no.
ah, I am-I am walking down the aisle...still walking.
(mrs. waltham takes her place.)
I am about to pass the bridesmaid i hooked up with last night.
(looking at the bridesmaid.)
hey!
(talking to phoebe.)
i told her "hey."
and now I am at the front with ross.
it is phoebe.
(he shows ross the phone.)
he looks pretty mad.
uh...I would better go.
how could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
no, still too ethnic.
my agent thinks i should have a name that is more neutral.
plus, y'know, i think it should be joe.
y'know, joey makes me sound like I am, i dunno, this big.
(waitress looks at him funny) which I am not.
stalin...stalin...do i know that name?
it sounds familiar.
(writes it down) joe stalin.
y'know, that is pretty good.
joseph stalin.
i think you would remember that!
where have you been?
(to chandler) hey!
he beat ya.
i can not believe it, ross.
this sucks!
is not there any way you can keep him?
how do you get a monkey into a zoo?
did you call the cops?
(entering) you know there already is a joseph stalin?
apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people.
you would think you would have known that!
phoebe.
whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing... i dunno what to say, ross.
uh, it is a monkey.
marcel, I am hungry.
hi, uh, I will be reading for the role of mercutio.
holden mcgroin.
ahhhhhh, i did not get the job.
i dunno.
some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.
he is not even jolly, it is all political.
ah, I am going to be one of his helpers.
it is just such a slap in the face, y'know?
hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
hi.
hi, sorry I am late.
nice shoes, huh?
(he wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle) you know more than one fun bobby?
ooh ooh ooh ooh, there is no room for milk!
uh, four.
yeah, and i met this really hot single mom at the store.
what is an elf to do?
sandy!
hi!
c'mon in!
(she enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...you brought your kids.
wow, that is, uh, dirty.
hey, kids... (approaching) hey fun bobby!
whoah!
who died?
there y'go, kids.
you seen sandy?
looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
nonono, you can not kiss ross, that is your brother.
alrightalrightalright.
(kisses him.
ross takes a photo) there.
(laughing and turning off the tv) so, what did you guys think?
(on phone) mom, so what did you think?
(he walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they are going to say.)
(hangs up the phone) wow!
well, my folks really liked it!
so what-what did you guys think?
(phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.)
it was not that good.
(entering from bathrooms excitedly) you guys!
you guys!
you are not going to believe what my agent just told me!
ooh, sorry.
sorry.
you finish, go.
I am going to be on two tv shows!
oh, you were not finished?
uh rach, if you are going to start another story, at least let me finish mine.
(groans in disgust) wow, it is really long.
well, these really are the days of our lives.
well, since you ask.
they want me back on days of our lives!
I will be playing drake remoray’s twin brother, stryker!
(jumps up) well—i got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
hey terry!
it is been a while, huh?
wow, it is funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
so!
stryker remoray huh?
when do you want me to start?
okay.
(looking between the pages and him) audition?
i thought you were going to offer me the part.
well, i was dr. drake remoray, stryker’s twin brother.
i mean, who looks more me than me right?
y’know terry, i-i do not really need to do this.
i got my own cable tv series, (pause) with a robot.
well.
i guess you think you are pretty special huh?
sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building.
makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh?
well y’know what?
(throws the script away) this is one star who is hoop… this is a star that the hoop—this hoop—i was dr. drake remoray!
hey.
was she happy you gave her the job?
(on phone) hello?
(listens) oh hey!
can you, can you hang on a second?
(to phoebe and rachel) it is the producers over at mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.
can you excuse me for a minute?
(on phone) hey, funny you should call.
i was just looking over next week’s script.
(listens) canceled?!
(listens) like they are taking it off the air?
(listens) ohh.
(listens) all right, see you monday.
(listens) we are not even shootin’ them anymore?!!
(listens) all right, bye!
(hangs up) they canceled mac and c.h.e.e.s.e!
why would they do that?!
it was a good show right?!
how could this happen to me?!
yesterday i had two tv shows!
today, i got nothing!
uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
well maybe i got a little upset and maybe i told them where they could go.
because they wanted me to audition!
hey!
terry.
wait!
terry!
wait—look—wait i-i… look, I am really sorry about before.
i was an idiot thinking I am too big to audition for you.
you got to give me another chance.
wait!
terry!
please!
look, i just lost my other job.
okay?
you have no idea how much i need this.
please, help me out, for old times sake.
(jumping up and removing the bandages) I am back baby!
ha-ha-ha!
(enters) guess what?
(they all look expectantly at him) i finally got that seed out of my teeth.
(enters) hey guys.
no, thank you.
but no, it is not close.
you said it was in escrow?
i could not even find it on the map.
you know what?
you are my friends, i want to be supportive, i will come with you.
shotgun!
what?
no, the only reason I am going to their stupid new house, is so i can point out everything that is wrong with it, so they do not move.
I am going to make them stay here.
hey, hey... i can convince people to do anything, you know.
i bet i can even get mike to do that "thing".
what is it?
i am not going to help you do that!
goodbye!
(he leaves) me too.
yeah, this place is great.
I am so happy for you guys.
although, you know, i hope you like fungus.
fungus!
yeah.
place is full of it.
okay.
then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
maybe.
so this is the living room huh?
ooh, it is pretty dark.
(starts feeling around him like he is in a completely dark room, touching chandler, who backs out and hits him) (squinting his eyes) are you kiddin'?
i think i just saw a bat in the corner!
(glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) maybe.
well, i just think you guys can do better than this house, you know?
or any other house for that matter.
fine, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay?
i just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.
(he turns his back to them and starts humming) hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... no... hmmmmm... it is not... hmmmmmmmmmm (turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) ow!
oh, hi, I am joey.
my stupid friends are buying this house.
who are you?
(understanding) oh.
i hate my friends.
(they shake on it as if they just made a pact) alright, look.
there is got to be a way that we can stop this from happening.
(thinking) uhm... oh!
okay.
you come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
woah, uh!
okay, let us hear your great idea.
(frustrated) ahh!
there is got to be a way.
i mean, you know, if monica and chandler move out here and now phoebe is married to mike.
that just leaves me and ross and rach, you know what i mean?
what am i going to do, i feel like I am losing my friends.
oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you are young.
me, I am set in my ways.
yeah, yeah, i guess.
(having difficulty admitting it) yeah, maybe.
(in near tears, realizes she is right) i hate to admit it, but you are probably right.
how did you get to be so smart?
(his mood changes instantly) just when i thought we could be friends.
(he leaves the room) (entering) hey!
oh, just er... you know, looking around.
but you know what?
this house... is great.
oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
(frightened) what?
that is not funny!
you know I am afraid of little girl ghosts!
what?
i get my own room?
oh my god!
(they all hug) oh!
hey, can i have an aquarium?
and a sex swing?
why not?
I will keep the tank clean.
i mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am i missing opportunities?
you know, I have always thought of myself as a serious actor.
i mean, should i be trying to do more independent movies?
hey bear, i need some career advice.
I am tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
morning, hey, you made pancakes?
(sarcastically) good morning.
(under his breath) kiss her!
kiss her!
b-bye janice.
so when ya' dumpin' her.
come on, quite yankin' me.
this is janice.
okay.
all right.
you look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you are not breaking up with her.
no blinking.
(entering) their not breaking up.
chandler and janice.
their not breaking up.
he did not blink or anything.
cute!
this is janice!
you remember janice?
there you go!
that is the spirit I am looking for!
what can we do?
huh?
all right who is first?
huh?
ross?
yeah, we will call that plan b. all right?
wheel!
fortune!
this guy is so stupid.
(yelling) it is count rushmore!!
i say, 'i am there!'
cool!
aw, is ross going to?
jan-ice.
because i, just, i feel bad for ross, you know, we-we always go together, we are like the three hocke-teers.
no, yeeees.
god, how do i say this.
(walks into the kitchen, chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled).
oh, hi, you know that girl from the greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?
look, i do not hate janice, she is-she is just a lot to take, you know.
oh, hey.
come on man, do not look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
look, what do you want me to say?
i can not.
it is like this chemical thing, you know.
every time she starts laughing, i just want to (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that i can have something to throw at her.
yeah, then-then who is the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
(chandler gives him a look like 'you stupid idiot!')
i, ah, i never said hate, i was very careful about that.
and you got a 'hate' from that?!
your taking a big leap there... but what does that going to do... okay.
I am in.
does it have to be a whole day?
yeah, i know, i sleep in the next room.
hey!
yeah, yeah.
we went to a mets game, we got chinese food, and you know, i love this woman.
you have got competition buddy.
I am sorry man, i tired, i really did.
but, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and i survived, and what is even more amazing, so did she.
it was bat day at shea stadium.
no man, that is huge!
now, i know i can stand to be around her, which means i get to hang out with you, which is kind of the whole point, anyway.
oh, hey, chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into ross.
hey, if it makes you feel any better, i do it too.
oh yeah, i always picture your mom when I am having sex.
hey.
sure, neighbor come on in.
uh, no, she is at dance class.
yeah, but, hey look, do not go through her stuff.
she gets really mad.
(chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)
(looking around the room.)
it is???
no.
no.
(with big eyes.)
all right, you are right.
I will talk to her.
I am a man.
(grunting) hmm.
(monica opens the front door and comes in.)
or maybe, it is because you are hanging around here at 11:30 on a wednesday.
(everybody gets up.)
hey.
uh, can i talk to you for a second?
this, uh, kid in this picture.
do you, uh, know this kid?
is that like a relative or something?
yeah, that is what i was afraid of.. okay, uhh…look janine i really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff.
it is…too girly.
like this.
(pointing to the picture) pictures of cute babies we do not know.
we..we can not have that.
look i do not know this baby.
i do not know if she is a famous artist or not.
you know, and i do not want to be a jerk but you are changing too much around here.
yeah but it is too much stuff.
you know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
I am sure it is a famous watering can, okay.
but, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
ohh, well, that is ok then.
but, okay my towels for instance.
i come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it.
it is up here on some hook..and…smells different.
yeah, well, it feels different.
alright, i can make my peace with the clean dry towels…also what is with these chips you bought?
(voice cracking) well that is like summer in a bowl.
hey chandler.
come on in.
we are knitting pot holders.
so what is really neat.
if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
ohh, i love birds.
(monica leaves.
chandler shuts the door.)
what?
hey.
hey look i am still joey, okay.
flowers they are just, you know, they are nice to look at.
and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist.
of a famous baby.
no I am not.
why would you say that?
that is just mean.
it is not what you said.
it is the way you said it….oh my god, I am a women!!!
hey, uhh, i need to talk to you.
I am sorry but we have got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.
i, uh, i got to be a man!
okay.
the living room has to remain a guy place, okay?
that is just the way it has to be.
great…great…and thanks for being so understanding.
i mean, i did not want to make a big deal out of this, you know.
(she starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.)
you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room.
i mean, if you want to.
and, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
and a couple of these little tiny boxes.
(smiling) okay.
so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
oh hey rach!
maybe you could take charlie shopping.
are you kidding?
rachel loves to shop!
and she has great taste!
yeah, she is the one who taught me, you do not wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you are trying on clothes.
(to charlie) ok, you are going to come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, slutty!
what is the matter, pheebs?
oh, are not that nice?
the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
(to charlie) alright, have a good time.
(they kiss) just... seeing what it would be like to be a paleontologist... it is fun, yeah!
bye.
all right, so.
how did it go at the fertility clinic?
so you are ruling out surrogacy?
so, i do not have to learn what that means?
enough said, I am there for you man.
where is she, upstairs?
come on ross, be a good guy.
step up and do it!
hello?
no.
no... eh... she went shopping with rachel.
why?
what is up?
oh!
how is it going?
what!?
but i already bought my ticket to bermuda!
fine, I will rent a car and drive...!
ross, you have to get that job!
well, just wake him up!
uh!
that is a tough one.
oh!
wait a minute, this happened to me before!
yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
(impressed) wow!
you look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot!
which is like the highest level of hotness!
then do not go!
alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike.
and afterward you come to my place and I will get you good and drunk!
how many times do i have to tell you!
ya, turn and sliiiide!
y'know, turn and slide.
look, we are not throwing it out!
i built this thing with my own hands!
all right.
but, you are going to have to tell them.
(he opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)
looks good, uh?
hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
what kind of profit is that?!
and you call yourself an accountant.
oh.
what do you do?
what?
what is wrong?
(to chandler) dude, phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni... well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, i do not think any of them are going to work out.
pretty nice?
(to peter) good for you!!
(looking at the flyer) yeah-eah!
200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
uh, pheebs, about your mom... (pause) how is that going?
that is so sweet.
(pause) I am going to get some coffee.
(gets up and leaves) this is the unit for you my friend.
sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
oh yeah!
i got in there myself once.
my roommate bet me five bucks that i could not, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
yeah.
it was funny ‘til i started feeling like i was in a coffin.
oh yeah?
(opens up the center and takes out the stereo) if i can not, I will knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
okay.
(he gets in the unit and closes the door) see?!

(to gene) i know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I am just like you!
(pause) only better looking and richer.
(on the screen there is the word "supermarket") uhm... ok. it is a store, like a supermarket.
(there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he should not have said 'supermarket'.
the next word appears, "notebook") oh!
i see-i see what i did.
yeah, ok, ok, uhm...
I am writing in my... noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... damn it!
(next word appears: "blueprint") oh, if I am building an house, the plan is not called the 'shmoo-print'... can not say that either?
woha... hey... (the last word is "football field" and there are 5 seconds left) in high school, i once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the... yeah!
but that is not what they are looking for.
(time's finished) oooh!

hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard!
like why would there be a ghost in my fridge?
(pause).
yeah!
(to henrietta) my friend rachel has a kid.
i totally know nursery rhymes!
(makes a thumbs up sign) oh, .. uh... uh... pass.
(next word: "rotunda") pass.

oh, then pass.

yeah, ross.
you and the baby just need better blocking.
oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the rainbow room?
is it real expensive?
I am takin' ursula tonight.
it is her birthday.
when is that?
oh, man.
what are the odds of that happening?
what can i do?
look, i do not want to do anything to screw it up with ursula.
well, if she is my friend, hopefully she will understand.
i mean, would not you guys?
(entering quietly) hey.
your sister stood me up the other night.
I have been trying for two days.
when i called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk.
i can not believe she is blowin' me off.
urse... ..ah, what are you doing here?
I have been trying to call you.
no, no, no, do not say "listen."
i know that "listen."
I have said that "listen."
i do not get it.
what happened?
what about everything you said under the bridge?
you do not drink.
oh, urse... (he tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)
why?
is it because I am friends with phoebe?
(thinking carefully) no.
no, i, i could not do that.
then, uh, then I am sorry.
i know... i do not know whether it is just because we are breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
pheebs?
we just got the message.
�hola, amigos!
(hey, everybody!)
i can not believe it.
when you guys come back, you are going to have a baby!
that is so weird!
but just think, ok?
what if everything goes right?
what if this woman does pick you guys?
I am going to say someone I am going to have sex with.
(the girl leaves and phoebe goes toward the couch) (to phoebe) hey!
so... who is your friend?
ow, why, why, why?
oh, name one friend of yours that i did that with.
mandy, uh?
uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
i know why i do not remember her, huh?
(he winks at rachel) ok, i may not have treated your friends well in the past, but i have grown up a lot, really.
honest, rach?
(pointing at himself) growth!
ok, thank you.
and i promise you i will not forget this one.
(he starts writing on his hand) mandy.
saraaah.
i can see why, nice shirt!
stupid gap on every corner!
hey.
well... nope.
oh, really?
you know what your great friend did?
we are out to dinner, ok?
(he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) we are getting along, having a really nice time.
i was thinking she was really cool.
and then, out of nowhere... hey, hey, look!
it is not about a few fries... it is about what the fries represent.
all food!
hey, hey, hey, hey.
look.
i take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants!
the more, the better!
all right?
just do not order a garden salad and then eat my food!
that is a good way to lose some fingers!
(mad and pointing a finger to himself) joey does not share food!
(he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) i like that!
a sharing buffer!
yeah!
I will order some extra fries!
maybe a plate of onion rings.
yeah.
and a shrimp cocktail.
and some buffalo wings.
maybe an individual pizza, uh?
and some mozzarella sticks.
(he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) what were we talking about?
i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
(now laughing a little) dude, i really do not think you should be wearing that.
(looking a little agitated now) looks like someone is the ladies!!
oh, that looks great!
good ordering!
oh, i did not know you liked french fries.
help yourself!
what is mine is yours.
(sarah reaches over and takes a few fries) uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
how about those fries though, huh?
(holds the plate between sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his) (spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) you are beautiful, you know that?
oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back) (visibly annoyed) now look what you did!!
i do not like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
well, i did not mean it!
I am sorry, I am overreacting.
okay, it is just when it comes to food, i have certain rules, okay, i mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) there are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you do not do (he takes a bite from it).
i really am sorry about, you know..before.
i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you.
(jokingly) well, stuffed clams.
uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
(more to himself than anyone else) so stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to oh, all right, I will just have what she is having instead.
oh yeah, sure.
no problem.
sure i do.
(holding up his own dessert) coule?
(laughing) really?
yeah, of course.
i can control myself.
(laughs uneasily and sarah leaves the room) (to the torte) stop staring at me!
why, just a tiny little... oh-oh!
I am not even sorry.
(nods) so, why are you still wearing it?
ooh... not so good.
yeah, and you know what?
we could do a lot worse.
(shouting to ross) joey does not share food!
hey ross, is uh, is staten island really an island?
ohhh.
i thought it was like long island.
hey, what time is it?
wow!
you realize that we have been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
yeah.
i realized it about a half-hour ago but i did not want to say anything because i did not want to jinx it.
oh, i-i, i think that is the first time i ever missed a meal!
(checks his pants.)
yeah, my pants are a little loose!
hey!
what the hell is that?!!
that, is not a cat!
{i have to agree with joey on this one.}
it is not a cat!
it is not a cat!
uhh, the ball thing.
hey ross, would not it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
okay!
(catches the ball) uh-oh.
i have to pee.
and rachel's in the bathroom!
man, i did not think we were going to make it!
maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
hi!
i do not know.
oh, i do not know….
yeah, can not do it.
yeah, we have not dropped it in… (looks to ross.)
oh, do not worry, it is not a cat.
that is right baby.
oh yeah, that is right!
whoa-whoa you guys, it is not a cat!
i do not know who made you the boss?
all right?
we (ross and him) invented this game!
did you get your money back?
oh hey, here pheebs.
(he throws her the ball.)
man that was great!
huh?
can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
oh, yeah, good idea.
ooh, ross, look!

(points behind ross.)
right over there!
right there!
look-look-look!
(to the rest of the gang) somebody help me out here!

i want to go on a ride along!
(returning from a deli) okay, i got it!
this place makes the best sandwich in the world!
oh-ho, yeah!
yep!
(dejected) yeah okay.
(to chandler) even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
yeah, okay.
did i say you could smell it?!
half the taste is in the smell!
you-you are sucking up all the tastiness!
okay, imagine the best sex you have ever had.
are you thinking about monica?
yeah, what is that like?
come on man!
(to gary) listen so uh, are you going to squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
oh what?

yeah, what is up with that serpico?
is everything okay?
(to ross) you okay man?
hi.
yeah, i did not know that.
cut it out ross!
i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
dude!
how come you took off?
is something wrong?
okay.
that is what this is about!
oh my god, you hate ross!
of course you do!
i saved him!
you are mad at me!
it all adds up!
you want ross out of the picture.
i do not know, but i do not like what I am hearing!
ohh, you are upset because you think i chose ross over you!
no!
i…knew…you could take care of yourself.
y'know, i mean ross, he need help.
he is not street like us!
well, no, not exactly!
all right, look, i, i was not trying to save ross.
okay?
my sandwich was next to ross.
all right?
i was, i was trying to save my sandwich.
i know it does not make much sense… look chandler, it was instinct!
okay?
i just went for it!
i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is (goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!
no!
i would never do that!
you-you are like my brother!
yeah!
in fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (he unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for chandler) here.
no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it is not a hot dog!
how good is that?
see?
oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
yeah.
with a bite!
(takes back the sandwich.)
gee-e-e-eez!
yeah, hero sandwiches.
(points at ross who points back.)
hey!

you are not going to believe this!
i just got off the phone with my agent… okay.
i got nominated for my part on days of our lives!
no-no.
no!
I am up for a soapie!
no, no, no!

and it has been since 1998.
(rachel returns from the bathroom.)
hey rach!
rach!
I am up for a soapie!
thank you!
well, i guess now i know who I am taking to the awards.
(points to rachel.)
many are scheduled to appear.
(pretending to be an announcer) and the winner is…joey tribbiani!
(he then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a bottle of maple syrup as the award.)
oh… wow!
i honestly never expected this.
i uh, i did not prepare a speech.
but umm, I would like to thank (rachel enters quietly) my parents, who have always been there for me.
I would also like to thank my friends, chandler, monica, phoebe, rachel… yeah may-maybe you do not tell anyone about this.
really?
what award are you practicing for?
oh, hey listen!
the soapie’s called today and i also get to present an award.
yeah!
(confused) what you-you do not think I am going to win?
yeah.
no-no i-i know i might not win, but it is just…I have never even been nominated before!
i want it so much.
hey!
(likes it.)
you practice losing the grammies too?
ah.
is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
whoa!
ross has a boyfriend.
how did you get over that teacher?
(to ross) problem solved.
(to rachel) this is it!
this is my category.
yeah, i got my speech!
yeah.
(does it.)
okay.
can i squeeze your ass?
‘kay!
what the?!
(joey pounds the table and starts yelling at rachel, and which is drowned out by applause.
rachel is desperately trying to tell joey that he is on tv right now.
he finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)
(angrily and monotone) any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home.
unfortunately only one can.
(shakes his head in disgust.)
the nominees for best supporting actress are from passions erin goff.
(there is applause, which joey disgustedly waits to dye out.)
from one life to live mary loren bishop (they start to applaud again, but joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from all my children sarah mchann, and from days of our lives jessica ashley.
and the winner is…(opens the envelope)…jessica ashley from days of our lives.
(applause) uh, unfortunately jessica could not be with us tonight so I will be accepting this award on her behalf.
(realizes something) and I am sure that jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me.
she would also like to thank my friends, chandler, monica, ross, phoebe, and rachel who is sittin’ right there!
(points at rachel.)
(the music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
rach we had to get out of there because, look what i won!
(he whips out the award for best supporting actress that he accepted for jessica.)
no-no!
no, I am accepting it on her behalf.
(he puts it up above the tv to display it.)
sure i do!
it is a verb!
as in, "i behalfin’ it!"
but why?!
i should have won one and i really want it and she did not even care enough to come to the thing!
it could also be a grammy.
come on rach!
no one saw me take it!
there was a whole table full of ‘them.
no!
i want an award i did win!
but nobody’s giving me any of those!
plus—hey rach, if-if i put it up there (points to the tv) right?
when people come over they will see it and they will think i won it.
i can scratch that right off.
all right!
I will take it back tomorrow.
(opening his door) if i can not have it you can not have it!
(rachel walks away angrily.)
okay wait-wait p-please be cool!
okay?
i work with this woman.
hey jessica.
ah, this is my friend rachel.
uh listen, here is your soapie.

(hands it to her.)
well, that-that-that is it?
you are going to, you are going to put it on your self or anything?
(to rachel) take it back?
y-y-yeah!
(as they start to leave, rachel pauses and steals a vase with flowers in it.)
yeah you do.
(they exit.)
(entering, dancing and singing) oh mommie, oh daddie, i am a big old baddie!
oh mommie, oh daddie, i am a big old baddie!
(he dances around the dinner table and exits) good.

yeah, that was real.
i hate this woman!!

she told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks.

oh, hey, how about this one.
ah, it is says so in the script!
y'know ah, i-i do not know why my character likes you either, i mean it says in the script here that you are a bitch.

just because she went to yale drama, she thinks she is like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
god, i just, i hate her!
i hate her!!
with her, ‘oh, I am so talented.’ and ‘oh, I am so pretty,’ and ‘ooh, i smell so good.’ hey, chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?!
y'know?

then how come i keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
well, why do not you tell me what you are supposed to be!
huh?
because i sure as hell can not figure it out!
i talk to you and it is nothing.

hey, listen you ah.... ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.

oh, we are supposed to just get him a ticket?!
that guy is always mooching off of us!
oh wow that is a great idea!
and i still have his credit card.
hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, i got this one.

(hands gunther chandler’s card.)
y’know i got to tell ya, sometimes i just—i do not get chandler.
y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you do not get all upset.
all the time!
(entering) hey!
whoa-whoa-hey-hey!
(motions to chandler, "what is going on?")
hi, paul is it?
(paul nods yes and still hugging joey.)
yes, it is in my… in…in my pocket.
(paul has not dropped him yet.)
(chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.)
my back pocket!
my back pocket!
oh hey listen i got us tickets to a knicks game tonight.

from now on, it is going to be joey and ross, best friends.
(they shake hands.)
okay!

(to ross) i think we got to end the freeze out.
oh my god!!
and-and-and-and-and-and, and we are going to be friends again!
oh it is water under the bridge, forget it!
i think I am going to cry!
(holding an empty tissue box) where is all the tissues?!
(throws the box down in disgust.)
(entering) hey guys.
whoa-whoa-whoa.
jokes?
you guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
let us go watch it at your place.
chandler, chandler, y’know what we should do?
you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses.
no, that is vh-1.
i got to tell you, the music these kids listen to today .
.
.
it is like a lotta noise to me.
i do not know… i uh, oh!
because, uh, i have not really paid the bill no, chandler.
look, forget about it, okay?
look, i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out.
oh, was she hot.
i know!
yeah, but, look i can handle it.
all right?
look, i can listen to the radio, huh?
and ross gave me this great book (holds up the playboy magazine).
sure.
not so much.
you forget how many great songs heart had.
oh, you guys, with this joke.
i got to say, i know i cracked up, but I am not even sure i got it.
ah, gunther, i can not pay for this right now because I am not working, so I have had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.
uh, i do not know.
ya see, it is just, see i was a regular on a soap opera y’know?
and to go from that to this, i just… plus, I would have to wait on all my friends.
what?!
maybe i could be a waiter.
could i use the phone?
(sheepishly) i finished my book.
(chandler and monica slowly retreat back to bed.)
hey ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘because I am heading up there.
sure.
(to monica and rachel) coffee?
‘because I am going up there.
(to a table of strangers) you guys need anything, ‘because I am heading up there.
you got it.
just being friendly.
(he gives monica a ‘what is wrong with you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
nah, it is okay.
right, gunther?
(winks at him as if they are in on a secret together.)
okay, but i do not see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
no.
yeah?
it is kind of embarrassing, y’know.
i mean, i was an actor and now I am a waiter.
it is supposed to go in the other direction.
i mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know?
i guess I am going to be hanging out here anyway.
i might as well get paid for it, right?
i just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
okay, i guess it does not seem that weird.
see, now it is weird again.
thanks, rach.
look, you guys are just terrific.
y’know?
now, how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers.
it is all about turnover.
oh, I am sorry, ross.
I will get it for you right now.
and since i made you wait, I will toss in a free muffin.
hey, gunther.
can you uh, can you cover for me?
i just got an audition.
really?!
i like your natural color.
come on man, it is a great part.
look, check it out.
I am the lead guy’s best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat.
listen-listen.
‘I am sorry, that seat’s saved.’ okay, maybe he is not his best friend, but … oh, man, i could totally get that part.
‘I am sorry, that seat is taken.’ no, no, i did not mean you.
but, you believed me, huh?
so, you would hire me, right?
exactly!
all right, everybody, listen up.
the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
yeah, it is for the kids.
to keep the kids off drugs.
it is a very important issue in this month’s playboy.
I am sure you all read about it.
not good, no.
i did not get the part, and i lost my job here, so … well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed.
so, i went anyway, and then he fired me.
yeah, what are ya going to do?
that is great.
thanks rach.
I am not answering that.

he starts talking in a fake french accent, making gestures with his hands) "bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" (phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, joey seems very proud though) see?
(offended) oh well i think i am, yeah and i think I am definitely going to get the part.

(closes his eyes to do so.)
oh-hey, there is carol again!

(to chandler) hey, if i hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
that is great!
that would be great!
let us do that!
oh right great!
welcome aboard!
all right!
now hey, i need to use the bathroom.
since i do not need any assistance in there, take a break!
(holding a plate of what looks like rice crispies treats) i know, here-here!!
(hands her the plate.)
(shaking rachel’s hand) hi!
well, it is always nice to meet the fans.
(turning and whispering to monica) she is not crazy is she?
(to rachel) so uh, how you doing?
(entering) hey there you are!
all right, here is a list of things for you to do today.
man, this going to be so great!
thank you so much!
all right, i got to go to work I am delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
(exits.)
(entering) hey!
is uh, is she going to be all right?
oh great.
(starts to go in.)
(to chandler) hey!
go take off those pants, they look ready!
all right, and over there is brady’s pub where i like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
well, that is a large piece of television equipment.
(points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.)
and uh that is an old man!
hey old man!
all righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
why?
(in drake’s voice.)
why can not the world stop turning, just for a moment?
just for us?
uh, yeah but uh, (in drake’s voice) i may have said those things before but, i never truly meant them.
until now.
okay, you watch too much tv.
thanks!
(looks at it.)
yeah, there is pulp in that.
(hands it back.)
i thought we talked about this.
i do not like pulp.
no pulp.
pulp is not juice.
all juice, okay?
oh my god, I am sorry, I am being so rude.
(turns to rachel.)
rachel, would like a soda or something?
because chandler would run right out and get it.
(to chandler) iced tea.
(to rachel) did i not just tell him?
(to chandler) okay look, chandler, if this (motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.)
you have got to listen!
(tugs on his ear.)
(chandler glares at him.)
you are going to throw that juice at me, are not ya?
(entering) hey!
hey chandler look, i know you are mad, but i just want to say I am sorry.
i-i was a total jerk.
completely of-over the line.
uh, i just i hate pulp!
y’know?
i mean, y’know how monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
yeah, of-of-of-of-okay anyway, i just wanted to say I am sorry.
here.
(hands him a cup.)
fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp!
just the way you like it.
oh my god!
that is great!
congratulations!
what is the story?!
are you kidding me?!
i love archie!
and the whole gang!
wait a minute.
that sounds a little familiar!
did they already do that one?
‘because i think i read it!
i know.
(joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls.
you will have to see it to know what i mean.)
yeah, his name is pat.
(climbing down from his chair) do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?
pretty cool, huh?
but if you are thinking you can put a fish in there and it would not get sucked up into the mechanism, well you would be wrong.
it is uh, right through there.
(points.)
yeah, life’s pretty great is not it?
well, with dr. drake they always tell me what to say.
and with joey, i pretty much have to make it up on my own.
yeah you did.
here you go.
let me ask you a question.
when was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
come, come here.
(entering) morning!
yeah.
well he actually saw you a little bit too.
no!
no!
no, not after seeing that.
wh-why?
that is ridiculous!
I am not a "star," just a regular famous actor.
rachel, would you stop saying that?!
hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when caprice was dying and she gave me… wow!
uh okay, well uh… (he gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)
sure!
as long as they do not find out you can keep whatever you want!
and i want you to have it.
yes!
yes!!
and every time you look at it, i want you to remember that you are a good person.
okay, you have had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you did not.
and that is what this ring stands for.
look, do you want the ring or not?!
hey!
all right!
whoa-whoa-whoa!
you are not going to use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
(not quite sure of how to answer that) well uh, look ross i uh, i think carol’s great and I am sure you are a very attractive man, but i….
you?
wow!
all right!
so, was it amazing?
just okay—did you do it right?!
huh.
but still ross, you are worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day!
y’know what i mean?
but you got to be with both of them, right?
not the other one?
yeah, you do not want that.
well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
you got a little bored?
yeah?
what did ya have?
sounds good.
I am tellin' you ross, she wants you.
you are in!
excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the she will?
thanks.
yeah, you are going to go up to her and say, "here is your egg back, I am returning your egg."
think it will work?
actually, tomorrow night kind of depends on how tonight goes.
no, no, no, do not you dare bail on me.
the only reason she is going out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend.
pathetic mess?
i know, but—come on, man, she is needy, she is vulnerable.
I am thinkin', cha-ching!
(rachel throws a roll at joey.
he picks it up and eats it.)
thanks.
look, you have not been out with a woman since janice.
you are doing this.
(looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) how do i look?
no, no, no, do not!
I have been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine.
just calm down.
(at the urinal) can you stop yellin'?
you are makin' me nervous, and i can not go when I am nervous.
good for you.
(jumps suddenly) uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
(to lorraine) we can not do that.
uh, can i talk to you for a second, over there?
uh, we might be leaving now.
she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.
I am not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it.
you are right, I am sorry.
you are right.
I am outta here.
here is my credit card.
dinner's on me.
I am sorry, chandler.
(in disbelief) whoa.
i do not know.
you dumped her on new year's.
(to chandler) if you do not do it, i will.
okay, pick a card.
all right now, memorize it.
(pause) you got it?
(holding up the queen of clubs) is that your card?
(he winks and smiles.)
(reading the card) whoa!
this guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!
(ross gasps) ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!
(ross and carol stare at him, then joey realizes what he just said.)
i mean, way to go ben!
(gives ben the thumbs up, which ben returns.)
man!
I have been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
I am always on the swings!
what am i doing wrong?!
luck!
whoa-whoa, but her birthday is not like for another month.
ross!!
we are having a surprise party for rachel!!
done.
they are going to do it together.
what, so i got to shut it down now?
whoa-whoa dad?
there is a dad in the commercial?
whoa, hey, maybe I will go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad.
i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather.
what?!
are you kidding?!
all right!
hey!
I am in, they are going to let me audition!
i know!
i know!
it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so i steered clear of her… oh yeah, yeah!
he is done tons of commercials.
I have seen him in like sugar smacks, playstation, and that one for the phone company.
in fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies.
chandler was mad….
that is great.
listen, would not it be great though if i got to play ben's dad?
i look more like him than you do!
(he winks at carol.)
(also downtrodden) yeah, i had to teach ross my bit because i actually did not get a callback.
(happily) yeah i did!
well, unfortunately, i do not get many callbacks so… who knows?
oh this is great!
i might actually get to play ben's dad!
man, this is going to be kind of weird.
hey pheebs!
(to the guys) hey!
ross good, I am uh glad you are here.
i want to talk to you about something.
well, I have been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against ben, the two of us competing, and that can not lead to anything good.
so, i think I am just going to step aside.
I am going to tell them that i will not audition.
that is it?
you are-you are going to let me do this?!
this-this is my career we are talking about here!
i just said that so you would not let ben do it!
look ross, if anyone should step aside it should be ben!
what?
chandler!
tell  them!
at least i care about his feelings!
do you know how hard this is going to be on him when he does not get it?
oh, come on!
have you seen what my kid can do?!
huh?!
i mean he dials phones!
he-he-he eats tortilla chips!
he-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
you just give him a spoon baby!
yeah!
because this commercial belongs to me and mitch!
yeah?!
so is yours!
hmmm, soup!
(tries again.)
hmm soup!
(tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.)
hmm, soup!
oh yeah, no problem.
(goes over to ben) hi ben!
so you want to be an actor huh?
i got to tell ya, it is no picnic.
there is tons of rejection.
no stability.
one day you are dr. drake remoray, the next day you are eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
(angrily) ross!
hi!
uh-oh.
well this is noodle soup and uh, I have been working with tomato.
but that is okay, no problem.
no problem.
hmm, noodle soup.
oh, what did i say?
how is that different?
(she looks at him until he gets it.)
oh!
yeah!
hmm, noodle soup.
okay.
hmm, soup.
(pause.)
i mean, noodle soup.
i mean soup!
no!
no!
i-i can do it one more time!
see?
look!
(eats another spoonful) hmm, noodle soup.
damnit!
(storms out.)
hey.
yeah right!
(gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
yeah?
well look ross, you do not have to.
okay?
it is not your fault i suck.
i mean what kind of an actor can not even say, "hmm, noodle soup."
(nods his head in disgust.)
what you do mean?
wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
well, you are way sounds a lot better than mine.
(thinks about it.)
yeah.
yeah!
it is not that I am a bad actor… no, it is just ah, i care so damn much about little ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
thank you!
so, did-did he get it?
eh, what are you going to do?
okay, uh pheebs, quick.
look!
this (his video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say?
y'know before it all starts?
i got to get the before shot!
oh!
(in an announcer type voice) and so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
(he grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)
ooh, something hurts!
are they?
i did not know i cared that much.
oh my!
not in my head.
(in a sexy voice) yep!
there is always room for jell-of… oh, it is easy.
yeah, i-i can do it with anything.
watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) grandma's chicken salad… (entering) ross!
get a shot of this.
(he is carrying an issue of the usa today and hands ross the camera.)
hey babies!
these are the headlines on the day you were born!
okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies… (throws the paper away to reveal a copy of playpen, which is the tv version of playboy magazine.)
check it out, huh?!
this is what naked women looked like the month you were born.
all right, now let us dive right into the good stuff.
(joey opens the magazine and ross sticks the camera in it.)
oh, a couple of nurses asked them out.
maybe they are with them.
yeah, i was bummed too.
i think saturday—(groans in pain again).
(entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) hey, you guys!
look what i found in the giiiiiiift shop.
(he doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.)
get up!
get up!
get up!
(the old man waves him away.)
umm, well, what else could it be?
or?
well, maybe a little.
i wish you had not seen me throw up.
(interrupting) whoa-whoa!
no-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up!
okay?
up, up is not an option—what is a urethra?
(monica whispers what it is in his ear.)
are you crazy?!
ohh, get these things out of me!
i want the drugs ross, i want the drugs!
(he starts rocking back and forth, taking ross with him.)
argh!
argh!
oh my god.
they are so small!
(both he and ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.)
(entering) hey!
(goes to the fridge.)
(holding a turkey leg) there is gravy?
i think i left a donut up here.
hey!
(to ross) that-that is a good trick.
chandler, look they are actors.
they are there to do a job, just ‘because they work together, does not mean they are going to get together.
i mean just ‘because it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it does not mean it is going to happen with them.
tom cruise and nicole kidman.
okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
well okay, so then you are fine.
the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
okay?
so as long as it is hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
it is when the heat goes away, that is when you are in trouble.
look, you guys have been to every play I have ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?
noooo!!
hey mon!
want some pancakes?
yep!
grab a plate.
no-no, stay right there.
(monica stops and joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.)
gettin’ closer.
listen also we are uh, we are watching the game here saturday night, if people want to come over.
oh yeah, who is playing?
all right pheebs, stick out your plate!
i do not know, it smells good.
(holding a magazine) wow!
the new playboy!
come here.
oh, yeah, totally!
that is such a turn-on!
oh-ooh, that is the turn-on.
oh-oh-oh-oh, how i do it is, i look a woman up and down and say, "hey, how you doing?"
(to phoebe) hey, how you doing?
well, you got to give him something that he can not say no too.
like uh, knicks tickets!
invite the guy to a knicks game, you are guaranteed he will say yes!
absolutely!
and if it does not, can i get the extra ticket?
what the heck is that?
no!
forget her, man!
you do not need her, you do not need that!
dude, tell me she actually told you this.
whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory!
there is a lot of theories that did not pan out.
the lone gunman.
communism.
geometry.
okay, for next time, what do you say?
what is ready?
i do not know, it looks the same.
oh yeah!
how did it go?
hey!
whoa-whoa-whoa!
before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, do not you have to decide who your best man is going to be?
what?!
he got to do it at your first wedding!
come on ross!
look, i-i do not have any brothers; I will never get to be a best man!
(pause) I will never get to be a best man!
(impatiently tapping chandler on the shoulder) what about me?!
you-you just said i could!
i can not believe you are not picking me.
yes!
(to chandler) shame about you man.
(entering) hey!
do you guys have like a big bowl i can borrow?
(grabs it) thanks.
oh, we are having a big party tomorrow night.
later!
(starts for the door.)
nooo, later.
(walks out the door.)
oh, it is ross’s bachelor party.
are you bachelors?
are you strippers?
then you are not invited.
(starts for the door again.)
oh-whoa, what party?
baby shower.
wow!
that sounds sooo like something i do not want to do!
later!
(finally, he makes his exit.)
this is what I have got going for the party so far, liquor wise.
get a lot of liquor.
okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I have got you, me, and chandler and I am going to invite gunther ‘because, well, we have been talking about this pretty loud.
all right—oh!
listen, i know this is your party, but I would really like to the number of museum geeks that are going to be there.
okay!
we will need a six-pack of zima.
you got it.
well, there is going to be strippers there.
he did not say anything about no strippers.
oh, i chose not to hear that.
yeah?
oh-whoa-wait, gunther do not-do not forget your shirt.
(he gives gunther his shirt and gunther leaves.)
oh, little party favours, check it out!
(it is a shirt that reads, "ross geller, bachelor bash 1998") oh-oh!
(shows him what is on the back, "best man joey tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)
oh, hey, do not forget your shirt.
okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over.
okay.
wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
there you go.
back to your parent’s basement.
all right.
(the museum geeks exit and joey unlocks his door and let us the chick and the duck out.)
come on boys, come on out!
here you go.
all right.
yeah!
oh yeah-yeah.
and i got the duck totally trained.
watch this.
stare at the wall.
(the duck complies.)
hardly move.
(the duck complies.)
be white.
(the duck complies.)
oh thanks.
thanks.
it was great meetin’ ya.
and listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a tuesday… oh unless you uh, you want to hang around.
yeah.
I will let you play with my duck.
hey, (realises he does not know her name.)
stripper!
(he notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it is empty and starts to panic.)
(running and banging on chandler’s door) the stripper stole the ring!!
the stripper stole the ring!!
chandler!
chandler, get up!
get up!
the stripper stole the ring!
the ring is gone!
dude, this is not funny!
what am i going to do?!
i go to bed last night, everything’s cool!
i wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!
of course!!
(shrugs.)
ugh!
i do not know what I am going to do!
i called the company that sent and th-they do not care!
then i called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this is not an emergency, then what is?
hey… so uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh?
man, that is nice!
i was uh, i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, i might want to get one of those… (laughs, softly) yeah, the stripper stole it.
dude, i screwed up, you do not have to turn me in!
oh, yeah, well i already did that!
they said they are going to look into it right after they solved all the murders.
i did that too!
they would not give me her real name or her number.
they said, "if i bothered them again they would call the police."
i said, "if you talk to the police, you tell them I am missing a ring!"
look ross, i am so-so sorry.
i-i-i… oh, that sounds like fun, but we have got a ring to find!!
all right, okay, this is great, uh, chandler, you get behind the desk.
and-and when she comes in hopefully, she will not recognise you because, well, why would she?
uh, okay, and then you buzz ross and i.
(to ross) you be mr. gonzalez, and I will be uh, mr. wong.
there was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
i do not get it!
it was in my room all night!
and if she did not take it, and i did not take it; and you (chandler) did not take it, then who did?
(the duck quacks.)
shh!
we are trying to think!
(ross and chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at joey, who does not get it.
after a short pause, with the duck still quacking, joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
if anything should happen to him… so!
things can go wrong!
you do not know!
what if he does not make it?!
yeah, but what if he does not?
he is such a good duck.
I am so worried about him, y’know?
h-h-h-how is the duck?
ohh, great!
oh hey, listen ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
no, it is not.
i mean you-you made me your best man and i totally let you down!
yeah, it is!
you would not have lost the ring, right?
y’know what, ross you were right from the start, he (chandler) should be your best man.
now, do not argue with me… really?
(starting to cry) i got to go check something over here.
(he walks away so that they can not see him cry.)
well, that went well.
yeah.
(to the gang) hey, no matter what happens with ross and emily, we still get cake right?
hey, what is up?
(he has solved the problem of eating the steak, he is eating it with his hands.)
well, i figured we are in another country, so it does not count.
(approaching) ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with emily, so… you spit on me man!
(wipes his face.)
emily is kind of taking a long time, huh?
hey, dude, let me in.
i got a girl out here!
no you do not, i just saw you go in there with monica!
look, which one of us is going to be having sex in there, me or you?
my giant?
i love that movie!
can i ask you something?
felicity and i, we are watching my giant, and i was thinking, "I am never going to be as good an actor as that giant."
do you think I am just wasting my life with this acting thing?
i mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I will ever get there?
thanks man.
but what about how much taller he is than me?
i mean, there is no way i can make myself taller now, y’know?
and who knows what science will come up with in the future, but chandler, what if i die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
hey, monica, wow you have been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
had the beef-tips, huh?
hi!
all right, I am going to go say hi the chick and the duck.
why would you need to say hi to them, you have been feeding them for four days?
thank you.
so what are you going to do?
how about tony's?
if you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it is free.
(aside to ross) so.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
I am telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet!
she is going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it will seal the deal.
(tasting) mmmm.
good.
it is creamier.
i do not know.
we are talking about whipped fish, monica.
I am just happy I am keeping it down, y'know?
uh-oh.
(in disbelief) vulva?
(sarcastic) whoaa!!
you cuddled?
how many times??
what is the big deal?
you just say what you want to do to her.
or what you want her to do to you.
or what you think other people might be doing to each other.
I will tell you what.
just try something on me.
why not?
come on!
just, just close your eyes and tell me what you would like to be doing right now.
....yeah... what else?
(walks to catch up to him) alright, look, I will start, ok?
come on.
come on.
alright, ready, look!
(in a low voice) oh... ross.... you get me so hot.
i want your lips on me now.
alright, now you say something.
come on!
you like this woman, right?
you want to see her again, right?
well if you can not talk dirty to me, how are you going to talk dirty to her?
now tell me you want to caress my butt!
(turning around) alright, alright.
I am around.
go ahead.
there you go!
keep going.
keep going!
say it... say it!
you are not going to believe this!

(even more abashed) a place to eat spaghetti.
oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they do not sell tickets here in new york, so... (hesitates for a moment)yeah connecticut...not west virginia.

to invest it?
ooh, ooh, i know!
we should pool all own money and buy the knicks!
oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward.
you are not going to let me buy the knicks??
i can not believe you are taking this away from me!
dude, I am sorry.
but hey, there is one spot left, right?

(to ross) I will show you how.
yeah, i want my tickets too (takes the bowl from rachel)!
and I am buying the knicks!
and steffi graff, ah ah!
hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!
this all thing was my idea!
(takes the bowl from monica) (in pain) oh!
no, no!
(they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window) (sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) rach, come on!
they are announcing the numbers!
my god, i can already feel myself changing.
and what did she say?
(checking the last ticket) damnit!
anybody got anything?
(to chandler) hey, that is so great about the job.
and i like to think i had a little something to do with it.
well, before, with the wishbone... i did not wish we would win the lottery, i wished you would get the job.
oh yeah.
me too.
(sitting in a chair) hey guys, so i just called the powerball hotline, can you believe it?

i will not leave you!
no you are not!

yeah, you are great!
okay, let us take it from… yeah, i thought i was pretty good too.
y’know what?
i think that is enough for now.
yeah.
i do not want to be over rehearsed.
oh, it is a new tv show.
yeah.
I am up for the part of mac macaveli or "mac."
yeah, I am a detective and i solve crimes with the help of my robot partner.
he is a, he is a computerized humanoid electronically enhanced secret enforcer or-or "c.h.e.e.s.e."
that is the title!
yeah!
y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
well, do not get your hopes up, because probably not going to happen.
i mean come on you guys!
my own tv show?
i just do not know if I am good enough.
you really think so?
yeah, and oh she is really nice too.
she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
it is like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.
so while you are thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
(does this intense look where it looks like he is smelling a fart.)
(there is a gunshot on tv) there is my scene, there is my scene.
[joey on tv] "mrs. wallace, I am dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
I am afraid the situation is much worse than we expected.
your sister is suffering from a..." (does the smell-the-fart look.)
(on stage in an austrian accent) vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.
(he goes into a song and dance number.)
i play al pacino's butt.
all right?
he goes into the shower, and then- I am his butt.
c'mon, you guys.
this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that is big!
okay, okay, fine!
make jokes, i do not care!
this is a big break for me!
all right well, I am outta here.
wish me luck.
yeah, whatever.
(exits.)
(entering, dejectedly) hey.
terrible!
i messed up every line!
i should not even be an actor!
yeah, did i fool ya?
oh, it went amazingly well!
yeah-yeah, it is down to me and two other guys.
and i know both of them, they are really good.
one of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who is always getting chased by those big flowers… I am just so nervous!
y’know?
the callback is not until tomorrow at five.
i feel like my head is going to explode!
there is just so much pressure.
i mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.
i do not know if you would understand.
i want this part so much!
y’know?
if i do not get this part I am never going to eat macaroni and cheese again!—no, i did not say that!
that is a lie.
yes!!
ha-ha!!
all right!
hey!
how cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this?
huh?
i mean how crazy would that be?
(on phone) hello?
(listens) what are you talking about?
the audition’s not ‘til 5:00!
(chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as joey listens.)
well, nobody told me!
(listens) who would you talk to?
(listens and turns around to see chandler trying to finish the message.)
nevermind!
(hangs up.)
the allergy guy got the part!
thanks!
how could you do this to me chandler?!
this part could have turned my whole career around!
hey, you do not even live here anymore!
what are you doing answering my phone?
i have my machine!
and what?!
did you sleep with her?!
what?!!
that is even worse!!
i do not know!
but it is the same!
over the line?!
you-you are-you are so far past the line, that you-you can not even see the line!
the line is a dot to you!
name one!
(getting out) awww, man!
he promised he would not take the chairs!!
well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he did not think big enough to fit a grown man!
i was tryin’ to make a sale!!
oh, man, if i ever run into that guy again, do you know what I am going to do?
no way!
I have been going to the guy for 12 years.
that is how they do pants!
ross, will you tell him?
is not that how they measure pants?
i said name one!
okay, buddy-boy.
here it is.
you hide my clothes, I am wearing everything you own.
look at me!
I am chandler!
could i be wearing any more clothes?
maybe if i was not going commando... yeah.
whew, it is hot with all of this stuff on.
i ah, i better not do any, i do not know, lunges.
(starts doing lunges) hey!

i can not believe this chandler!
well you-you-you-you might say congratulations!
i saw the board!
i went to the audition!

i did not mean to make you feel bad.
(shocked) that is mean!
you really had me going there!
yeah, you are right.
okay look, listen, let us talk about what a huge star I am going to be!
you hug me!
hey, do we do this too much?
yeah.
come on c.h.e.e.s.e., I am not leaving without you!
try routing your backup source through your primary cpu.
wow!
(back to reading the scene.)
well then I will just have to carry you.
ross, you do not have to yell.
y’know what?
i think that is enough for today.
thanks for your help!
(he grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
i think i know that girl.
oh yeah, i definitely know her.
really.
and what do you mean you never have fun anymore?
you have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
well, why do you call him gandolf?
no, i had sex in high school.
will you calm down, he is just a human guy.
really?!
all right, I will see you guys.
i have an audition, but I will definitely hook up with you later.
where are you going to be around noon?
okay.
(leaves as the phone rings) hey!
what are you guys doing here?
i thought you would be out partying with gandel-worf.
so you have been sittin’ around here all mornin’?
so what if he did not come!
we can still go out and party ourselves!
well, we could do that!
we will do it all, and better!
look, after tonight, gandolf will want to party with us, dude!
come on!
yeah!
yeah!!
yeah!
all right?
let us go!
all right, so we will get a little coffee, and get energized, and we will head back out.
so, we are having fun, right?
we do not need that wizard guy.
we hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we will head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
are you serious?!
thank god!
I am exhausted!
yeah, but uh, i do not want to be up too late, so uh, I will have a decaf.
i can not hear a word you are saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
yeah, i know.
yeah!
and i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends.
we are 29, we are not women.
oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
oh, ‘because you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there is your admirer.
(ross is stunned.)
oh, well think of it like this, when you are 90… no that is not what i was going to say at all.
no, what i was going to say is when you are 90 you will still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
hey chandler!
y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
oh well listen, anyway she is directing the new al pacino movie.
you got to get me an audition!
no-no-no, please-please chandler i-i-i would owe you so much!
hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject?
why?
will you make the call or what?
all right!
thanks!
you are the best!
now listen, the last day of auditions is thursday.
okay?
so i got to get in there by thursday.
okay?

(angrily) thursday!
look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day.

tuesday, two day.
wednesday, when?
huh?
what day?
thursday!
the third day!
okay?!
okay.
the part i want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
(to the fireman) hey buddy, do you think i can borrow your uniform this thursday?
oh, how bad is it?
chandler, is that… (mimes someone using a movie camera and chandler nods yes.)
hey-hey listen… (chandler waves him away.)
when you are off the phone, do you want to get a pizza?
hey listen, so when is-when is my audition?
i mean i know it is thursday, but what time?
ah-ha!
hey, you want to do joey a favor, maybe you go out with joey.
(he turns around to see chandler glaring at him.)
this right here is where i keep the pizza.
(he points to the chair.)
and uh that is where the napkin is.
(points to the floor next to the chair.)
i know!
(shrugs his shoulders.)
this is where i keep the pizza.
(it is the same location as before.)
and—hey!
where did the napkin go?!
(the napkin is not in it is spot.)
(in a funny voice) yeah, so it turns out that it was not the hair straightener that started the fire.
(rachel prompts him on what to say next.)
no-no, it was the candles.
it is very not good leaving candles unattended.
in fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is… (phoebe suddenly enters.)
uhh… uhh… okay.
well, i have to go now.
(phoebe leaves.)
well ross, it seems pretty clear.
i mean what is more important?
what people think or how you feel, huh?
ross, you got to follow your heart.
hey-hey-hey!
so, how did it go with dana?
any reason i should leave a block of time open say thursday?
you could not do it?!
ah whatever!
no that is all right.
do not worry about it.
rach!
hey!
it is fine!
you are at joey’s!
yeah!
look!
(he throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
i know.
all right, do not waste it, i mean its still food.
(he picks it up and eats it.)
hey, here you go.
(hands her another one.)
oh, very funny.
i do not know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be thursday.
(chandler does not say anything until joey figures it out.)
you got me the audition?!
let us hug it up!
(they hug.)
that is right, all the ladies want to stay at joey’s.
yeah.
hey!
so?
wh?
monday, one day.
tuesday, two day.
wednesday, when huh what?
thurs—(he gasps in horror.)
oh!
(runs out and chandler just shakes his head.
after a second joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)
oh, it is a poster for that world war i movie that I am in, check it out.
uh-huh!
i know.
I am coming soon to a theater near you!
I am in thx!
I am unsuitable for children!
yeah, yeah, it is already generating oscar buzz.
i thought i did!
oh hey guess what?
the premiere is next week and you are all invited!
(they all gasp.)
sure!
why not?!
hello?
one guest?
you told me i can have six tickets!
oh my god.
so that is it?!
i only get to bring one guest?
(to monica, chandler, and phoebe) did you hear that?
i only get one extra ticket to my premiere.
so some how i have to pick between you three and ross.
you said you did not want to go.
definitely not invisible.
well uh…i think i want to take chandler.
yeah!
yeah!
i mean I am sorry, i wish i can take everybody, but y’know chandler always supported my career.
he is paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
it is not just the stuff he paid for, i mean it is-it is everything.
y’know?
he read lines with me.
he-he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i did not get parts that i really wanted.
you always believed in me man.
even, even when i did not believe in myself.
thanks.
that means a lot to me.
(in a manly voice) I am going to go shave.
(gets up.)
a little tall.
do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that i look taller?
(chandler does so) there you go.
(and they walk down the red carpet.)
(onscreen) "i thought i knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
(to chandler) okay, this is it.
it is my big fight scene coming up.
(he looks over and chandler and notices that he is asleep.)
you liked it?
you really liked it?
which part exactly?
oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo?
did-did you like that part?
you fell asleep!!
there was no kangaroo!
they did not take any of my suggestions!
that is for coming buddy.
I will see you later.
(starts to walk out.)
hey!
sleeping beauty!
(in a baby voice) oh no, were you upset?
did you lose sleep?
uh-huh look, the only reason i can over here was to settle things between us!
okay?
you have done a lot for me and my career, i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it!
okay, so how much do i owe you?
give me a number, i do not want to owe you anything!
ah-ah-ah!
we are doing this!
okay, now you got me my first set of head shots.
right, how much were those?
okay, five hundred dollars.
what else?
okay, so that is another five hundred.
five hundred and five hundred, that is… (pauses to figure it out.)
please!
all right, what else?
which we are still keeping under our hats!
what the hell are you talking about, (in a jamaican accent) "the south will rise again man."
yeah.
okay, what else?
rent!
okay.
okay, so I am writing you a check for…so you fell asleep during my movie.
big deal right?
how do you clear this thing?
hey, it is me!
I am comin' in!
ahh, I am going to go get some chicken.

okay.

some extra crispy?
dirty rice?

(interrupting) was his name angus?
(monica and chandler laugh.)
oh, he was this cab driver we had in london.
yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer!
that uh… hey, ross, bodington's!
that was good beer.
y'know, I would walk back to london for another frosty one of those bad boys.
later!
(exits.)
(to chandler) i bet it was about her a little.
say that to him and you are golden.
(she just glares at him.)
hey, pheebs!
(jumping out of his way) see ya!!
(to the girls.)
what the hell was that?!
(poking his head out.)
having some trouble?
I will kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
(in tremendous pain) all right.
good deal.
uh, okay, pheebs?
umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you did not get to go to london and how you were kind of feeling left out?
all right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
yeah, all of us!
all day!
phoebe!
mine!
nooo, i said we needed a new plan.
which, is the new plan!
uh, pheebs, you are leaking?
wow!
this girl is good.
(to leslie) so ah, phoebe tells us you write jingles.
(to leslie) ah, anything we might of heard of?
(to phoebe) wow, that was kind of brutal.
ah, he can not make it, he said he had to his... (sees ginger) whoa-oh!
(hides behind the coat rack.)
phew, close one.
(entering) hey.
is ah, is chandler around?
oooh.
nooo.
no, no, ah, are you sure it was not something that sounded like ginger, like ah, gingeer?
aww, man.
that is the girl i was hiding from.
when she finds out he is my roommate, she is going to tell him what i did.
what, oh, oh, oh, no, no, i can not, i can not tell you that, it is like the most awful, horrible thing I have ever done my whole life.
all right!!
okay, it was like four years ago.
okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her dad’s cabin.
just me, her, and her annoying little dog pepper.
well that night, i cooked this really romantic dinner.... i wish.
no.
after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire.
well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out.
so, i picked up a log and threw it on.
or, at least what i thought was a log.
i wish.
see, i guess another thing i probably should have told you about ginger is that she kind of has a ah, artificial leg.
i ran!!
(entering from his bedroom) morning.
(to chandler) heard about the leg burnin’ huh?
listen, i ah, i know it is a longshot.
but, by any chance did she find that funny?
yeah.
you okay?
yeah.
where have you been?
hey, this girl will not turn around and i can not tell whether she is hot or not, what do you think?
alright thanks, oh hey have you talked to chandler?
how come?
oh why do not you fly out there and surprise him.
oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
(nods) did not till just now.
hot not hot (she turns around) hot!
i said i think you are hot and now I am embarrassed.
that would have been better, I will try that hi I am joey.
look i do not usually ask out women that i meet in coffeehouses (turns round) gesundheit really, great, did i actually ask you?
(turns round again) seriously gunther you should see someone about that cold, if it gets much worse you could die!
(gunther looks scared) yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
do you have any cake?
(bends down to see and the cactus pricks him in the ass) awch!
that is why.
(enters) hey listen to this... i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her.
well that is not even the weird part.
i do not think she remembered sleeping with me.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable, you guys know.
and who is fault is that.
hey!
i never have an off night ok although sometimes when I am a little bloated i do not feel very sexy but even then I am better then most!
interesting.
all right I will go out with her again and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) oh salt bloaty!
what?
no.
(pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
uh huh, sure, yeah.
how can you not remember me?
how could you not remember that we slept together?
i dunno!
come on, come on, search your brain all right.
it was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, i was here you were here, we had sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here not there.
anything?
my god woman!
how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
ooooooooooh, i slept with you!
and you obviously remember me hey!
i still got it.
(turns back to hayley) so were good.
(she just glares at him) I will let myself out.
(looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily i would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her?
did i not sleep with her?
your right!
i love my life!
(he gets up to go and speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) i actually did sleep with her.hey you guys.
hey, you all know my dad, right?
dad, dad.
(shakes his head) (snatches the phone) hey ma.
listen, i made the appointment with dr. bazida, and... excuse me?
(to his dad) did you know this is not ma?
sure.
so how long you been... (goes back to chopping) since then?!
...i d'know.
you are one to talk.
(puts the mushrooms in a saucepan) oh man.
please tell me one of  them is ma.
it is like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life.
he is like actually some spy, working for the c.i.a.
(considers) that would be cool.... this blows!
what is the matter with rog?
night, you guys.
hey.
can, uh, can we help you?
I am joey tribbiani.
dad, ronni's here.
who-ah-ho.
no you will not.
if you go to a hotel you will be...doing stuff.
i want you right here where i can keep an eye on you.
that is right, mister, and i do not care how old you are, as long as you are under my roof you are going to live by my rules.
and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
now dad, you will be in my room, ronni uh, you can stay in chandler's room.
okay.
now this is just for tonight.
starting tomorrow, you got to make a change.
this has gone on long enough.
well, either you break it off with ronni then you got to come clean with ma!
this is not right!
i do not want to hear it!
now go to my room!
just trying to get comfortable.
i can not sleep in my underwear.
I have been thinking.
y'know, about how I am always seeing girls on top of girls... y'know what i mean, about how I am always going out with all these women.
and i always figured, when the right one comes along, I would be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
now I am looking at my dad, thinking... no.
you really think so?
thanks, chandler.
(snuggles up to him) (runs out in a towel) what is the matter with you?!
ma!
what are you doing here?
oww!
big ring!
hold on, you-you knew?
so then how could you i mean, how could you?!
ma, i do not mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?!
i mean, what about you?
I am...happy...for you?
ma, I am sorry.
i just did what i thought you would want.
yeah.
you are ten times prettier than she is.
with this ring?
(her engagement ring.)
no contest.
yeah.
he is going to keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she is going to keep pretending she does not know even though she does, and my little sister tina can not see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today.
yeah, i guess.
it is just parents, after a certain point, you got to let go.
even if you know better, you have got to let them make their own mistakes.
clear the tracks for the boobie payback express.
next stop: rachel green.
(he goes into the bathroom.
we hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by monica in a towel) sorry.
wrong boobies.
it is the chick!
she is…going through some changes.
good luck.
(to monica) and I am still right!
she is mad because i know today’s her laundry day and that means she is wearing her old lady underpants.
yeah, what is that about?
oh yeah?
ross, how many items left in that bag?
six.
all right, we will start with…apples.
okay.
uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
okay, the last thing… no-no, not for like another two weeks.

no!
all right, who-who makes up the questions?
huh.
i know.
animals dressed as humans.
(to chandler) the irish gig guy?!
it is all relative.
(to chandler) nana?
(answering the question) althea!
i took a shot.
hey, no way, that rooster’s family!
what do you have against the duck?!
he does not make any noise!
look, we are not going to… (shocked) dah!!
(chandler motions for him to calm down.)
oooooh!
okay.
big fat goalie.
weekend at bernie’s.
everyday use.
guest.
uhh, 11!
i call monica’s room!
sure i can, standard shotgun rules, I am sight of the room and i called it.
what?
hey—ooh pheebs, are they in there?
oh wow!
you can tell this soon.
what?!
you can not just ignore the bet!
it is a bet!
you bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
hey, do not get mad at us!
no one forced you to raise the stakes!
but it is our apartment!
did you see the size of the closets?!
hey!
hey, i see you guys already met, huh?
did not i tell ya?
always showin' off.
oh, kath, we should get going.
we are going to by hamsters.
hey.
yeah-yeah, i told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
(entering) hey!
hey guys.
(to chandler) listen uh, you want to get some dinner with me and kathy tonight?
it is 4:30. okay, i see what is going on here.
yeah!
you do not like kathy.
yeah, you have been avoiding her ever since we started going out.
look, i made an effort to like janice, now i think it is your turn to make an effort to like kathy by going out to dinner with us.
right?
good, and hey!
my treat.
(he turns to go into his bedroom then stops.)
but that is only because you are not eating anything, right?
is she great or what?
(to kathy) I will be right back.
(to chandler) what was that?
kathy was being really nice and you just walked away.
i thought we had a deal.
i want you to like her!
but if that is too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
well then, do it better!
well, that is pretty good.
but you might want to tone it down a little.
(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `little general.')
hey!
(chandler turns down the tv) now, we are not actually going to be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
hey, chan, can you help me out here?
i promise I will pay you back.
i will, really.
I will pay you back this time.
well...
I am helping out down at the n.y.you.
med school with some... research.
oh, just, y'know.... science.
(sigh)... it is a fertility study.
alright, come on you guys, it is not that big a deal.
really... i mean, i just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project.
hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, i get seven hundred dollars.
we make fire.
cook meat.
oh, ok. i do not know, she is, uh.... she is pretty great.
what, you think I am going to tell a girl i like that I am also seeing a cup?
well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
yeah, well, i still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if i want to get the money I am not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what i mean.
hey!
the country?
oh no!
how can she do that when she is never shown any interest in you?!?
he is right, man.
please.
move on.
go to china.
eat chinese food.
listen, buddy, we are just looking out for you.
we want you to be happy.
and i may only have a couple beers in me, but... i love you, man.
(joey gives ross a hug) like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
well, not so good.
she definitely thinks tonight is the night we are going to... complete the transaction, if you know what i... then you do.
heh, heh.
what do you mean?
not following you.
(to rachel): that book got me through some tough times.
(pats chandler on the leg) that is good, just keep rubbing your head.
that will turn back time.
well, given that he is desperately in love with you, he probably would not mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
the country.
he is right, because if you are just going to, like, break his heart, that is the kind of thing that can wait.
heh, heh.
it was nothing.
(panicked) uhhh.. y'know what?
forget about me.
let us, uh... let us give you another turn.
sure!
why not?
how do you mean?
shhhh!
she is still asleep.
oh, it was amazing.
you know how you always think you are great in bed?
well, it is like, last night, i could not do the thing that usually makes me great.
so i had to do all this other stuff.
and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
it was amazing!
and not just for her... uh-uh.
for me, too.
it is like, all of a sudden, I am blind.
but all my other senses are heightened, y'know?
it is like... i was able to appreciate it on another level.
i know!
neither did i!
seven hundred bucks!
man, hell of a two weeks, huh?
y'know what, though?
i really feel like i learned something.
what, are you crazy?
when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
(joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
tell us!
(to billy) so you are the gynaecologist?
and it is not fake, it is totally brutal.
what?
my hands are totally clean, i just gave the duck a bath.
yeah, maybe it is like y'know, that jock thing.
y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
(pats ross on the butt) yeah.
what are we getting?
yeah, or you can teach him a lesson.
y'know?
what you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right?
then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.
(thinking aloud) now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
(sticking his head out the window) hey, the fight’s starting!
(sticking his head out the window) fight’s over!
check it out, he is winning!
(to monica) pete’s winning!
no-of-of!!
(voice over) previously on friends.
yeah.
we figured when we could not find you, you would gone home to make up with rachel.
which is probably what you shoulda done.
huh?
look, ross look, I am on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff that is going to get you in trouble.
yeah, and there will not be a relationship left to rebuild.
all right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she does not find out some other way.
(spins the chair around so that ross is facing him) did you think about the trail?
(stomps on the footrest which pops ross up into a sitting position) the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
(slapping his hands with each word) you always have to think about the trail!
yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that is all.
i mean, come on, it is just a little wax.
okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off?
do not answer that.
awful!
horrible!
she was nothing compared to you.
ewwwww!
y'know what, i do not think we should listen to this anymore.
(goes to open the door) why not?!
(to chandler) I am hungry.
yeah, we will be fine.
oh man, pizza?
i like pizza.
(makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to rachel) put olives on the pizza.
you think i need a new walk?
well y'know, I have been walking the same way since high school.
y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice.
i think i need a ‘take notice’ walk.
whoa-ho-ho!
(he looks at chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.)
yeah, okay.
maybe she killed him?
(whispering) no, i really have to pee.
(thinking) all right.
it is a new day.
all that stuff about rachel, you do not feel that now.
it was crazy!
you are fine.
you are better than fine!
you are, as your friend tony would say, grrrreat!
everything’s normal!
she is just your friend rachel!
your friend rachel.
your friend!
rachel.
(thinking) hey, it is your girlfriend, rachel!
(entering) hey, chandler, you got a minute?
i-i really need to talk to you.
well, neither.
i do not know.
it is-it is just…lately, I have been feeling… okay, here is what it is… (pause) you know what?
i feel a lot better, thanks!
(starts to leave) all right.
okay.
you and monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to london.
oh, no, but that is different.
i mean, there are rules there, too!
you know what i mean?
it was different for you guys!
i mean, i mean, you were both in the same place, right?
yeah.
you know what?
this is a bad idea.
forget it.
forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
hey.
well, what is up?
what?
whaaat?
oh my god.
you do?
i know.
i know.
and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys.
i mean, it is rachel for god sakes.
i know.
i know.
and she is not only my friend; she is my pregnant friend!
she is my pregnant friend who is ross’ ex!
what am i going to do?
you know, and i keep, i keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know?
i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i do not like about her.
you want to hear it?
she made me switch to light mayo.
that is it!
that is all i got!
and, you know what?
it tastes the same and my pants fit better!
you think?
yeah, just a crush!
that is all this is!
it is a crush!
I am joey; i do not get deep feelings.
not really.
(from outside the bathroom) hello?
why?
(entering the bathroom) what are you guys doing in here?
it is no big deal, okay?
phoebe and i talked about it.
it is just a crush!
it is going to go away!
(looks down) dude, you got to rearrange your bubbles!
oh!
(thinking) all right.
it is a new day, and it is just a crush, that is all!
just a little crush!
all that worrying i was doing, that was crazy.
crazy!
like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!"
everything’s going to be fine.
it is just a crush.
(thinking) i love you.
hey.
so where is mon?
and you are not helping?
you damn right i am, I have been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
yeah, you too.
how do you think she is doing?
man, i wish i had a nanny like you.
sure.
why not?
so, what, you think I am just going to sleep with her and never call her again and things are going to get uncomfortable?
(thinks about it) yeah, sounds about right.
oh, man, why did have to go and say that for?
now that you told me i can not have it makes me want her even more!
yes!
fine.
(looks around, then focuses on monica) for a walk.
actually, that will be long.
you know, i really need to organize my thoughts.
allright, fine, i only have one thought!
it is about the hot nanny, i got to see her!
now you are telling me i can not see her??
you guys are killing me!
she is forbidden fruit!
it is like ... like she is the princess and I am the stable boy ... why are you doing this, huh?
did ross tell you not to let me go over there?
huh.
interesting.
now there are obstacles.
hot nanny and me against the world.
this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
fine ... mediocre porn hey rach, so can i sing happy birthday to you now?
oh ... (starts to sing) happy birth ... (sees molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after molly) so you see, molly, what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline.
it takes a lot of hard work.
oh, i did not go to college.
molly ... people do not study acting ... (upset) will the stable boy never get the princess??
no ... the leather sticks to my ass.
you know, this is not fair.
what makes you think that I am just going to sleep with her and then blow her off?
huh?
can not you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her, and might want something real?
(pause) look, the truth is, i have not felt this way about anyone since rachel, ok?
i did not think i could ever love again.
ok (admits) it is like my favorite fairy tale come true!
(chandler looks at him) the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
her first cookie?
she has cookies all the time!
no!
no... and, for the record, I have also never given her a frosting from a can!
you-you-um, i think there is been an oversight.
whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
i got to a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok?
and i know how much you want to have a baby, you know, and i would love to help you get one.
thank you!
alright, let me see how I am going to start... "dear baby adoption decider people..." hey!
uhm... are not you a little overdressed?
that is right, yeah.
always nice to meet a fan!
i know, she may be the hottest girl I have ever hated.
(using a laptop) oh, monica and chandler's recommendation.
i want it to sound smart but.. i do not know any big words or anything, so... what did i just say?
oh my god, that is great!
I am smart!!
no, no, I am... (he uses the thesaurus) "brainy, bright, clever", i love this thing!
look out ladies, joey tribbiani's got the whole package!!
hey, finished my recommendation.
(he hands it over to chandler) here.
and i think you will be very, very happy.
it is the longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
(sounding very proud of himself) some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
of course it does!
it is smart!
i used the the-saurus!
yep!
oh, ‘they are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
yeah, yeah and hey, i really mean it, dude.
why not?
ah, look who is back!
(he sees the bags) why do you have bags?
rach, why does she have bags?
what?
you slept out here?
but uhm, we are getting rid of her, right?
rach, please tell me we are getting rid of her.
oh, come on!
last night i was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping amy badly) "uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"
i do not need that kind of talk in my house!
because we will appreciate it more when she is gone?
yeah, monica made us!
yeaah.
(yelling at her) I am curvy, and i like it!
great, I am finished!
in fact, i just dropped it off at the agency.
yeah.
no can do amigo.
no, i did not use the computer.
felt more personal to hand-write it.
(chandler and monica look even more shocked) yeah, and do not worry.
i did not try to sound smart at all!
see ya later!
(leaves) (picks up the phone) hello?
yeah, this is joey tribbiani... oh, hi!
well, I am glad you liked my letter... no my mommy and daddy are not home right now... (looks puzzled) okay, bye bye.
(hangs up) (to himself) she was nice!
whoo-hoo!
(and leaves for rachel's room) (yelling from rachel's room) she has a lot of crap!
hey, yeah!
then we could do that telephone thing!
y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it is connected by a string!
(entering) hey guys!
what?
what?
you mean how they are friends and nothing more?
(glares at rachel.)
yes, but y'know what?
it does not matter who knows what.
now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
no-no-no!
no-no wait rach, you know what would even be more fun?
telling them.
i can not take any… noo!
i can not take any more secrets!
(to rachel) I have got your secrets.
I have got their secrets.
i got secrets of my own y'know!
oh yeah?
well, you do not know about hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
(joey shies away.)
ugh.
yeah?
well i did not tell them!
uhhh, phoebe and joey.
and rachel.
i would have told you but they made me promise not to tell!
I am sorry!
but hey, it is over now, right?
because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
no!
not unless!
look this must end now!
I am listening.
so he likes to break stuff.
yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
no.
they know you know.
i could not even if i wanted too.
(looking out the window) hey-hey, check it out!
check it out!
ugly naked guy has a naked friend!
(entering the hall) oh man!
are not you guys done yet?!
i want to sit in my chair!
ooh!
i like that!
(to phoebe) oh, okay!
show him your bra!
he is afraid of bras!
can not work  them!
(he swiftly rips open the front of phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
it is not my first time.
dude!
all right!
so that is it!
it is over!
everybody knows!
are you kidding?
i love that guy!
(starts singing) morning’s here!
morning is here— see, this is a great apartment.
uhh, pheebs, those are uh, those are santa pants.
you have knicks tickets?
(examining the tickets) oh my god!
those are almost right on the floor!
yeah!
you are not stupid.
you are meaner than i thought.
yeah, you do!
come on!
come on, season tickets!
season tickets, do you know what that means?
oh come—look, when i was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right?
my dad never won!
of course, he was not in the sales division, but still, i never ever, ever forgot that!
hey!
we do not make enough fun of you already?
oh-no, do not try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
what?
all right look, ross, he is right.
emily’s great, she is great!
but this way too soon, you are only going to scare her!
no!
you do not want to wreck it, you do not want to go to fast!
wait-wait-wait-wait!
(to chandler) come on!
come on, let us trade!
the timing’s perfect, i just clogged the toilet!
yes!
did not you ever read sports illustrated?!
no!
i did not read yours!
but come on, we can go to the game tonight!
it is the knicks!
whoa!
huh.
yeah, the knicks rule all!
done!
oh.
ooh, we could end up with nothing.
ooh, i like that.
come on man, you know I would do it for you!
because, you are my best friend.
all right!
okay!
what is the game?!
what is the game?!
uhh, they are tall.
oh.
yeah!
okay.
(joey picks a card.)
phoebe, you look, i can not.
okay.
okay.
(he looks at the card.)
ace!
what?
ace is high!
jack, queen, king, ace!
okay.
uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) it worked!
king!
why?!
seriously, good game though.
good game.
(he tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.)
(to chandler) what are they so mad about?
they get the apartment back!
oh yeah.
hey!
should we give these shirts to the girls?
y’know, kind of like a peace offering.
hey, want a beer?
(hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)
(jumping up.)
whoa!!!!
i do not know.
i do not want to move again!
that was one good minute!
good night.
ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
yeah!
yeah!
monica and rachel made out.
(giggles like a schoolboy and monica glares at him.)
hey!
(singing) get into gear!
(happily) okay!
um, this?
what up?!
(answering the phone) hello?
oh, hi.
yeah, hold on a second.
ross, it is julie, for you.
(throws him the phone.)
needs some clothes altered?
why do not you go see frankie?
my family's been going to him forever.
he did my first suit when i was 15. no wait, 16. no, 'scuse me, 15.
(still confused) all right, when was 1990?
(to chandler) you know, i think i was sixteen.
no-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I am not fallin' for that again.
whoa, whoa.
and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe?
hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello.
he will know what it means.
can we see her?
how are you doing?
ooh, that bad, huh?
look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.
it is one of my gifts.
you got to tell ross how you feel.
what about her?
they have only been going out for two weeks.
ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
look, rach, rach!
I have been with my share of women.
in fact, I have been with like a lot of people's share of women.
the point is, I have never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you.
frankie?
what are you talking about?
no way.
I have been going to the guy for 12 years.
that is how they do pants!
first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.
(chandler and ross stare at him) what?
ross, ross, would you tell him?
is not that how they measure pants?
what?
that is not?
(realizes) oh my god.
hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... i swear to god, dad.
that is not how they measure pants.
yeah.
it is actually our first official date naa, no.
this is the part I am actually good at.
(pause) it is ok!
well, i... i know exactly what I am going to do!
no, no no no no.
see.
each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness.
no, i do six things!
first, i look deep in her eyes.
then, i kiss her.
next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh.
no!
not like that, no no.
no, like this.
(he starts lightly grazing chandler's thigh) more foosball?
i thought you paid.
(rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) ha, guess we will not be going back there!
yeah.
hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
what is the matter?
i do not get it, chandler loved it!
ok. (a little giddy) uh, was that good for you?
rach, you sure you want to do this?
ok. well, how, how can we make it easier?
ok, yeah, got it.
this thing welded shut?!
all right, turn around, i got to get a look at this thing.
sorry!
I am sorry!
(he stands up) this never happened to me before!
I am an expert at taking off bras!
i can do it with one hand!
i can do it with my eyes closed!
one time i just looked at one, and it popped open!
i blame your bra!
then i blame you!
yeah!
that is right!
you threw me off with all your slapping!
(contemplates for a few moments what rachel just said) nah!
i do not have another level!!
hey chandler can i talk to you for a second (points to the hall).
(to rachel) hey!
yes madam, ready to power through!
uh!
(when she is done she throws her bra at him) ok, you are scaring me a little bit.
oh!
yeah!
uh uh!
no, no, no!
you kneed me in my misters!
(he just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) soldier down!
well, i know what is the matter with me.
i do not know.
yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
yeah, yeah... absolutely.
i mean, just because something is difficult does not mean that you quit.
yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
that is a... pla-an.
(sighs) wow... i did not see this coming.
i do not get it.
i mean, i was so sure this was what i wanted.
i guess they were not as good friends as we are.
so... i love ya.
yeah, me too.
ooh, yeah, I am not going anywhere for a while.
there is this woman, that i like.
a lot.
well, it is complicated.
she is with this other guy.
for a long time.
and i could never do that to the guy, y’know?
’ccause we are really good friends.
yeah, he is the best.
oh, i do not know.
i do!
so much!
i can not stop thinking about her!
i can not sleep, i— it is rachel.
yes.
yes.
i like rachel.
(startled) yeah, okay but look, buy uh—hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else i like?
you!
and it-it does not get said enough.
i like you ross.
yeah, but it is not a big deal.
I am an actor, y’know?
as-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
look no, i-i know it is bad, and i know it is wrong.
okay?
but-but it is not like anything’s ever going to happen.
y’know?
these-these are just feelings, they are going to go away.
oh come on ross!
hey ross-ross do not… hey.
look, i understand if you came by to hit me, i deserve it.
oh what then?
kick me?
(getting worried) bite me?
oh now—hey ross-ross!
do you want to-want to come in for a beer or something?
do uh, do you got any beer?
all-all i got is this melon stuff that rachel left.
i do not… (pouring two glasses) hey look ross, you need to understand something okay?
i uh…i am never going to act on this rachel thing, okay?
i-i would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
(he hands ross a glass.)
anyway, it uh…look it will just…take me a while to get over her, that is all.
I am not even sure how to do that, i mean I have never been in love before so… yeah, i thought you knew that.
wow.
hey look, if it helps, i do not want to feel this way.
honest.
i just keep thinking, "ah, I will get over this."
y’know?
i just—it just keeps gettin’ harder.
i do not, i do not know what to do.
y’know?
what do i do?
okay that is the green stuff talkin’.
but what if uh—and I am not saying she will be—but… are you sure?
hey thanks.
oh my god i have to tell her!
i have not even thought about what i will say.
what should i say?
I am sorry, you are right.
what am i going to say?
(he takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.)
oh!
okay.
okay, i can do this.
i can tell her how i feel.
just uh, just stand up straight.
(does so.)
take a couple deep breaths.
(does so.)
look confident.
(does so as rachel opens the door and startles him.)
i uh, i just came by because i-i want to talk to you about something.
here?
in the hall?
what are we animals?
okay umm, i just came by to tell you that i…want to have dinner with you tonight.
that is all.
okay.
that is good.
okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you are going to say.
good.
yeah.
(someone comes out of his apartment and it startles joey again.)
do not you people ever knock?!
what?
yeah!
sure!
uh, look at the uh, the reason…(exhales slowly)—is it hot in here?
i would, but this is a nice place and my t-shirt has a picture of calvin doing hobbs.
yeah.
sure.
(they both half stand up, joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and rachel looks down it to see his t-shirt.)
uh… how long have we known each other?
uh-huh, long time.
but over the past few weeks… actually uh, could you give us a second?
I am not quite sure.
yeah, here we are.
uhh… i… i think I am…falling in love with you.
I am falling in love with you.
does it really matter?
okay look rach, i know this is a lot.
you do not have to say anything.
you-you uh, you take as much time as you need.
(long pause as rachel says nothing.)
okay, you got to say something!
but.
(hangs his head down.)
yeah-yeah right.
that is okay.
that is fine.
that is uh, pretty much what i was expecting.
so uh, it is no big deal.
all right?
i think I am going to go.
(stands up.)
do not start doing that.
you can not do that rach, ‘because then you are going to make me do that.
(starts to cry.)
oh, here we go!
(sits down next to her.)
sure!
hey-hey-hey, hey!
you can not.
okay?
ever!
oh no-no rach, please, do not be sorry.
okay?
do not be sorry.
(they hug again.)
y’know i was only kidding you.
hey!
it is my house-warming present for monica and chandler.
uh-huh.
and i named them chick jr. and duck jr. yeah, i figure they will love it at the new house, you know?
it has that big backyard.
and then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to.
yeah.
it is a shame people can not visit there.
yeah, erica went into labor last night.
monica and chandler are at the hospital right now!
uh, i think she is still asleep.
hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night?
she seemed pretty pissed at you.
oh my god.
you and rachel?
so what does that mean?
are you guys getting back together?
so, so is she still going to paris?
okay.
i bet you did!
sure, yeah.
will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
oh my god!
what did you say?
you can not just give up!
is that what a dinosaur would do?
dude, I am just trying to speak your language.
hey!
oh, you are not taking her with you tonight?
ross, wait!
could you get me a muffin?
hey, you know what might help?
it is a... it is a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
no, i sat in the paint.
why not?
yeah, i know what you mean.
i mean, sometimes... damn it!
you know, the baby can not read, mike!
monica just called from the cab.
she said they should be here any minute.
and apparently, there is some big surprise.
(to monica) hey, so what is the big surprise?
oh, they are so cute!
now, what, what kinds are they?
hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica.
hey, maybe that is for the best.
yeah.
you know?
you just... look, you got to... you got to think about last night the way she does, okay?
maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
maybe that is okay.
you know?
maybe, maybe it is better this way?
i mean, now, now you can move on.
i mean, you have been trying to for so long, maybe now that you are on different continents.. (looks at phoebe) right?
maybe now you can actually do it.
you know?
you can finally get over her.
what?
really?
yeah, you are!
this is so cool!
but ross, ross.
what do you, what do you think she is going to say?
good luck, good luck!
oh, hey, hey, can i give you guys your house-warming present now?
alright!
ah... chick jr.?
duck jr.?
do not hide from mama!
quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack... okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, i got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, because now they are gone!
oh!
you stepped on my egg roll?
just put it on a plate and leave.
alright.
wait, wait.
do you hear that?
oh!
they are in the table!
we got to get them out of there!
oh, oh!
maybe we can lure them out.
you know any birdcalls?
well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
oh!
oh god!
so what do we do?
okay.
does that mean we have to bust it open?
oh my god!
all right, you know what?
we do not have a choice.
it is like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if I would gotten the part.
"those are our men in there, we have to get them out!
even if i have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
it did not.
(yelling) do not worry, you guys, we are going to get you out of there.
okay.
here goes.
i need to say goodbye to the table first.
okay.
table, you have given us so many great times.
and you guys, jordan, victor, joel... all of you guys.
what can i say?
you guys make us look good.
you want to say anything?
okay, here we go.
i can not do it.
yeah, they are stuck inside the table!
yeah, you did not even use the tools for most of it!
yeah.
probably not.
nah.
i do not know how much I am going to want to play after you go.
yeah.
I am going to miss these little guys.
it was nice having birds around again.
what?
i could get a goose!
thanks man.
did you hear that, you guys?
you are going to get to stay here!
and, and it is good, you know, because, because now you have a reason to come visit.
uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
yeah.
uh, does this mean there is nothing to eat?
i love you!
hey!
so did you guys make it in time?
has it always been purple?
yeah.
i guess so.
(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) y’know what else makes you wonder?
check out the rack on this chick!
(turns around to point it out to ross and finds that ross is glaring at him.
so he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)
then why are you wearing monica’s jacket?
(whispering) ross!
come here, check this out!
no!
no-no.
look, there is a bug stuck in tar right here.
(bends down to get a closer look.)
(standing up) y’know, there is two women dude.
right-right up here.
(starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
(annoyed) i do not know!
(goes back to looking through the pipe.)
(pause) yeah, i do.
what?!
all right—hey!
do not look at me!
you are the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid burger king comet!
(covering his ears and yelling) oh no!
no!
no!
(he starts banging on the door.)
come on!
all right well, y’know…i guess we know what we have to do to get down.
ross.
i was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
(points it out.)
all right, it will not go down any further.
it is stuck.
oh whoa-whoa wait a minute!
i have to do it?!
what if i smack my head on the concrete?
(looks at the ground and at ross) i do not know ross!
i-i tell you what, let us flip to see who does it, okay?
you-you call it in the air, all right?
no.
what?
no!
no ross!
no-no!
stop!
I am not jumping!
okay, look i have an audition tomorrow and i can not go if i break my leg.
well all right so, it looks like we are even!
man, I am starving!
what the hell was i thinking at dinner?!
"do you want soup or salad?"
both!
always order both!
yeah?
really?
no one’s home?
yeah!
all right!
just hurry up!
i think face to face.
face to face, yeah!
all right.
(grunting) oh my… how much do you weigh ross?!
y’know, when we talked about face to face, i do not think we thought it all the way through.
well, just shimmy down me and drop!
hi.
(angrily) yeah?
maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
it is not that far!
just drop!
ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I am not wearing any underwear!
not me.
twice?
you guys okay?
now, see, i do not believe any of that.
i think once you are dead, you are dead!
you are gone!
you are worm food!
(realises his tactlessness) ...so chandler looks gay, huh?
(entering with chandler) morning.
we ready to go?
what?
check it out, giants-cowboys.
(he has a pocket tv) no, it is the pre-game.
I am going to watch it at the reception.
(hides the tv, but he still has an earphone) just a, uh... hearing disability.
seventeen-fourteen giants... three minutes to go in the third.
ooh, look-look-look-look-look!
i got monica naked!
i need something sweet.
ooh-ooh, i!
i am thankful for this beautiful fall we have been having.
yeah, the other day i was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up.
oh!
which reminds me, I am also thankful for thongs.
(note: actually, i think every guy is thankful for thongs.
that and spandex.
j ) i mean, it is not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering.
i mean, it is amazing how much they can do with so little material!
and the way they play with your mind!
is it there?
is it not there?
oh, come on!
i want to hear it!
it would not be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out!
man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that!
i do not have any past life memories.
hey, it is not like it sounds.
(muffled) hello?
phoebe?
look.
(he walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
i know!
it is stuck!!!
i put it on to scare chandler!
well then help me get it off!
plus, it smells really bad in here.
it is joey.
i can not!
it-it is stuck!
sorry!
sorry.
(pointing) it worked!
i scared ya, i knew it!
ha-ha!
(turning all the way around, and still not facing chandler) yeah, you are!
(starts dancing.)
i scared you!
hey, i was not the only one who looked like an idiot.
all right?
remember when ross tried to say, "butternut squash?"
and it came out, "squatternut buash?"
you are a dork.
yeah, right!.......y'serious?
(pause)....are we still talking about sex?
yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
yeah, calm down.
you do not see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
.....well, this is still ruined, right?
your folks are really that bad, huh?
what are we supposed to be seeing here?
ohh, nothing.
i know what it did!

(shrugs) sure!
it flushes it.
hey!
(sees janice.)
ah!!
(janice screams in surprise.)
and there it is.
so what are you doing bringing her here?!
there is people here!
yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.
(they all look around and then back at joey.)
I am tellin’ ya!
hey!

(to rachel) i bet i stopped listening before you did.
dude, you are not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
hey-hey, what is going on?
thanks for telling me!
ohhhh, good one!
and yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
nope.
(to ross) man look at this!
ross, i can not believe you said you would play rugby.
i mean look how brutal this is!
(pointing to the tv) okay, ross, look-look-look-look, look right here.
that is called a scrum, okay?
it is kind of like a huddle.
ross!
(laughs) they are going to kill you!
all right, come on look, ross can take care of himself!
it is not like he is…chandler!
ross-ross-ross-ross!
stay away from that guy (points), and that guy (points).
and that one—dude!
they are all huge!
well, maybe that is because you are closer to you.
so you look bigger to you from where you are.
i totally do not know what you are talking about.
no.
dude, if you go back out there, you are going to be dead ross!
the red ross!
okay.
yeah, sure.
uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I am going to go get some ice.
(reading) three down, days of our lives star blank tribbiani.
that is me!!
I am blank!!
yeah you are baby.
no.
they really like me over there.
they want to do a big profile on me, but i said no.
remember what happened the last time i did an interview for them?
i said i write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft.
so who knows what i might say this time.
fine!
all right, I will do it.
but hey!
you guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if i y’know, start to say something stupid.
yeah.
oh, not at all.
happy to do it.
(laughs) actually, i did not know the magazine was paying for it.
would not have mattered, I am doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
and I will have all the muffins.
(he goes into a song and dance number) oh, you said it mike.
(rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) aw!
there is got to be a better way!
(finishing installing the milk master 2000) wow, it is easy.
(starts to poor the milk) now, i can have milk everyday.
yeah, i guess it is.
and so… I am going to get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I am going to go to blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
but when i return, 200 years from now, you will be long gone.
but i will not have aged at all.
(gets on the ladder) so you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because adrienne… baby…I am going to want to meet her.
shh, ok, here i come, here i come.
see I am comin' to fix the copier, i can not get to the copier, I am thinkin' what do i do, what do i do…so i just watch  them have sex.
and then i say, wait, here is my line, (joey from tv) you know that is bad for the paper tray.
thank you.
wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again.
hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me.
there i am, there i am, there i am, there i am, there i am… well, there are so many things, it is hard to pick just one.
(drinking a beer) look at this clown!
just because he is got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
(yelling) get out of the way jackass!
(to rachel) who names their boat coast guard anyway?
what are they doing out here?
the coast’s all the way over there.
(points to the coast.)

i think you are right.

that is kind of nice.
yeah.
yeah.

in my spare time i uh, read to the blind.
and I am also a mento for the kids.
(the gang shake their heads.)
y’know a mento, a role model.
(chandler bites his fist to keep from talking.)
right.
matter of fact, i do.
uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
wow!
you realize that we have been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
yeah.
i realized it about a half-hour ago but i did not want to say anything because i did not want to jinx it.
yeah!
oh, i-i, i think that is the first time i ever missed a meal!
(checks his pants.)
yeah, my pants are a little loose!
nothing!
well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, have not been able to stand up since.
but um, i do not think it is anything serious.
no way!
‘kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it is going to be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
(rolls over and shows chandler.)
why did i have to start working out again?
(looks at the weights he was using.)
damn you 15s!
i like it.
what is not to like?
custard?
good.
jam?
good.
meat?
goooooood.
the fridge broke.
i have to eat everything.
cold cuts, ice cream, limes—hey, what was in that brown jar?
not anymore.
(pulls out a fork) all right, what are we having?
(starts digging in.)
uhh, i do not believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.
I will take those to go.
(to the interviewer) for the kids.
it was so stupid, i said some stuff in an interview that i should not have said.
but believe me, that is not going to happen today.
well, i said that i… (the gang jumps up and interrupts him.)
you guys, this is shelley, she is interviewing me for soap opera digest, and shelley, this are my friends… okay.
no thanks.
how come you have two?

(he throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
i know.
all right, do not waste it, i mean its still food.
(he picks it up and eats it.)
wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and i did not get it.
but that was a hell of a kiss.
rachel is a very lucky girl.
all right.
let us get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
(he removes the waste bucket that is over the duck and the laundry basket that is over the chicken.)
and they are off!
(he puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
judge rules, no violation.
and the duck gets the nutter-butter!
judge rules, nutter-butter.
yeah.
I would seen this thing on the discovery channel... that is right i stepped up!
she is my friend and she needed help!
and if i had too, I would pee on anyone of you!
umm, no.

y’know, when we talked about face to face, i do not think we thought it all the way through.
hey pheebs!
(he sits down next to her.)

(he turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows phoebe that he is got panties on.)
how much of a man am i?!
no I am not.

(to phoebe) hey, how you doing?
hey!
how you doing?
I would love to show ya, but i just tucked her in.
she is sleeping.
(the women both laugh) hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
(just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it.
it turns out that joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a porsche.)
hey, (in the joey voice) how you doing?
oh!
i see what happened.
it is because i was trying to repel you.
right?

oh dear god!
not much to tell there I am really shy.
oh great!

oh, good to know.
(the interviewer leaves.)
so close!
yeah, i called the lady about that.
i told her i was just joking.

testing the effects of joey tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
(in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money.
oh, i wish i had a twin.
where could i find someone who looks exactly like me?
(the camera widens its shot to reveal a room full of joey look-a-likes.
joey looks at the guy next to him and then back at his script.)
(entering) no!
no!
no!
no!
no!
how you doing?!
how you doing—damnit carl!
go wait in the hall!
(goes into the hall.)
look, i got to apologize on the behalf of carl.
oh, did i not mention?
carl is a guy i hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
okay, i know it sounds crazy, but i think it might work.
y’know?
the only problem is, carl’s acting is… (does the international hand symbol for so-so.)
yeah, he is the reason i did not get that big minute maid commercial a couple of years ago remember?
we were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
(to carl) pizza!!
we like pizza!!
get out!!!
(carl does so.)
all right carl, we are next.
now remember, what is not going to be?
that is right!
and what are you not going to do?
(gets very angry) damnit carl!
(carl goes to say something more, and joey silences him with a grunt.)
that is us.
that is right, $2,000.
damnit carl!
hey!
what are you guys doing up?
(thinks) dark red.
aww, you guys are so cute!
all right, I will see you in the morning.
(entering) hey, you guys!
(to monica) hey.
that uh, that my sweatshirt?
well uh, it is just that uh, y'know if-if you are going to be wearing someone is sweatshirt should not it be your boyfriends--and I am not him.
no-no!
no!
i mean it is going to be all smelling like monica!
no!
no, you smell like a meadow.
(pause.)
I am sorry.
(runs to the bathroom.)
(to phoebe) hey!
(sees that monica's there.)
oh.
yeah, i did not know you guys were going to be here.
(backing away) what?!
why?!
nothing!
all right!
there is something.
i kind of had a dream, (pause) but i do not want to talk about it.
(starts for his room.)
well, it involved monica.
do not worry, there was not any sex in it or anything.
i have not dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two--ish.
well, okay.
you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle.
y'know like you guys were doing last night.
so, that is it.
I am in love with monica and I will be moving out.
it-it does not?
that kind of sounds like your dream dude.
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.
(looks at her) not really.
no, i do not think it is just about just getting a girlfriend.
y'know?
i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend!
yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
friends first?
that is interesting.
no, never done that either.
(in a sexy voice) how you doing?
oh, I would love too, but i got acting class.
but y'know what?
i guess i can blow that off, (in a sexy voice) for you.
uh, hey, rach let me ask you something.
uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight.
yeah that is not such a bad situation they got going over there.
I am thinking of getting me one of those.
well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great… …is because they were friends first.
y'know?
so i asked myself, "who are my friends?"
you and phoebe, and i saw you first.
so… I am saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch.
I will treat you real nice.
(pulls out a chair for her.)
will not-will not that take longer?
yeah.
i understand.
i understand.
(pause) man, i wish i saw phoebe first!
(entering) hey!
yeah, yeah, i met this woman.
(starts for his room.)
uhh, well, she is…really good in bed.
(to rachel) well look, hey, it is all your fault!
well because you did not give me advice!
no!
you gave me a pickup line!
as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first.
i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!
(pause) and her roommate!
closeness-shmoshness!
there was three of us for crying out loud!
(entering) all right!
hey, who wants pizza?!
(taking a bite) oh, great!
can you believe i found it on the second floor?
uhh, just a minute officer!!
oh!
hey, somebody left their keys.
(looks at them) ooohh, to a porsche!
{transcriber’s note: oh come on!
who would leave the keys to their porsche behind?
if i had a porsche, I would have the keys surgically attached to my hand!}
hey gunther, these yours?
na-uh!
(to everyone there) hey did anybody lose their keys?
there is a lost and found?
(gunther sets the box up on the table.)
my shoe!
(grabs it out of the box.)
well, i did not realize until i got home.
i was not going to walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
y’know what?
I am going to go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.
(goes to do so.)
great!
thanks.
(exits.)
yeah, it is not mine.
yeah, it is (looks up and sees the woman) mine.
me too!
yeah.
and comfortable.
do uh, do you like leather seats?
(checks in the window to make sure it has them) it is got ‘them!
(entering) hey guys!
hey babies!
oh, I am having the best morning.
that uh, that porsche I have got the keys too, still there!
you should see the treatment i get when I am with that car!
people are friendly; they-they want to talk, and not just about the car!
one guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
the ones that got me the porsche!
will you keep up!
(chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used.
he drops it disgustedly.)
but i figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they are going to start to think that i do not own it.
so i figured I will wash it.
right?
monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow?
yeah, she tops out at 130. and that is just in the city.
i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate.
sure!
okay, take it easy.
really?
oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
oh i-i uh, found the keys and now I am just polishing her up.
yeah, but it is my wax.
sure.
here.
(he hands them over.)
I will uh, save your parking spot.
why not?
yeah, so did i.
(entering wearing nothing but porsche clothes) so the porsche guy took his car back.
no.
no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.
of course!
only an idiot would wear this stuff if you did not have the car!
right?
oh, I have been there.
yeah, i am going to go drive my porsche.
(starts to leave.)
come on!
what are you doing?!
I am in character!
would you talk to her!
(storms out.)
why is not that valet back with my porsche?
(to women passing him) porsche.
hi!
how are the gellers?
hey!
it is porsche!!
(he is right y’know.)
hey!
hey!
be careful around my porsche!
hey!
how you doing?
I would love to show ya, but i just tucked her in.
she is sleeping.
(the women both laugh) hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
(just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it.
it turns out that joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a porsche.)
hey!!
we are so in luck!
treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement.
wait right there.
(goes back into the hall) (returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) huh?!
uh-huh.
this and a bunch of bubble wrap.
and, some of it is not even popped!
just pickle.
yeah-eh-eah!
(rachel glares at him) oh-oh, sorry, i-i knew what he meant.
uhhhh.
(he is not sure) no!
no.
but ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
yeah-well-yeah!
yeah-oh-yeah.
come on in.
he cut off his ear.
I am out.
wow!
that is pretty nice.
i thought he cut off his ear ‘because he sucked.
what else you got in there?
in the woods.
no wait-wait, that is the joke answer.
spock’s birth control.
wow!
there is a lot i did not know about vomit.
(the duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.)
(to the duck) in a minute.
(the duck goes back into the bathroom.)
twelve hundred dollars?
you think i have $1200?
I am home in the middle of the day, and i got patio furniture in my living room.
i guess there is a few things you do not get from book learnin’.
how about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
you want to see what i got?
(he gets up to empty out his pockets) okay?
I have got a baby tootsie roll, a movie stub, keys, a kleenex, a rock, and an army man.
hey!
and a 50.
(the salesman stops suddenly) huh, these must be chandler’s pants.
oh, i-i think I am going to stick with the v, i want to see how this bad boy turns out.
wh-what is going on?
no he does not!
well, it is good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that vesuvius.
yeah.
and speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
well, we can talk about something else.
what do you want to talk about?
vivisection?
the vasdeferens?
the vietnam war?
it is a grand tradition!
this is so unfair!
the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, i was not allowed to.
all i got was a stupid steak dinner!
oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
so uh, you and mona, been a while now.
how is it going?
hot?
I am going to take that book and beat you to death with it.
will you let the lady talk?!
yeah!
(on cell phone) I am sorry i got to cancel tonight baby… so you uh, nervous about getting married?
look, look let us pretend it is a real bachelor party.
okay?
y’know?
before your wedding.
come on, it will be fun.
how does it feel knowing you are never going to be with another woman again huh?
knowing you are going to have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
that is her!
okay, come on!
(they go over and open the door.)
uh, that-that is-that is me!
joey tribbiani, a big fan.
why-why would she go in the bedroom?
yeah, that is one naked hooker!
wait!
wait!
maybe she is a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she is supposed to do.
maybe monica’s playing a joke on ya.
y’know?
getting her own husband a hooker, that is pretty funny.
i bet ross was in on it too.
i mean he was conveniently busy.
(on machine) hey ross.
it is joey.
there is a hooker over here and we thought maybe you would know something about it.
maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
maybe she wants you to learn something.
huh?
now is there anything you are really bad at y’know, sexually?
in a minute!
all right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
hey!
it is your bachelor party.
i do not want to.
you do it!
you do it!
i miss this.
no, i-i miss hanging out with you.
not like we used to.
remember?
you and me used to be inseparable.
y’know now it is like…things are different.
oh sure—and hey, do not get me wrong, i am so happy for you guys.
i just…i miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?
you got it.
come here.
(they hug and are observed by the hooker.)
(on phone) hey!
i do too think about the consequences of my decisions!
(listens) what gives you the right to… (listens) go to hell!
(hangs up the phone and opens the fridge.)
stupid guy on my phone.
(entering, with his grandmother) hey everybody, look who is here!
you remember my grandmother!
chandler, she does not understand a word of english.
she is my biggest fan.
yeah, she is the only one in the family that is believed in me.
yeah, i uh weighted like 27 pounds when i was born so… wow pheebs, you speak italian?
okay, see that blind guy right there?
I am going to bash his head in later.
oh umm, my big scene is coming up.
big scene coming up.
(walking past) true story!
(goes and sits down.)
okay, here is my big scene.
my big scene's here!
(they have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they are entering an apartment.)
oh my god.
(smiling) okay, everybody just keep smiling.
it will kill my grandmother if she finds out.
(smiling) oh, they cut me out of the show.
(smiling) not likely.
because you see that body bag right there (smiling) I am in it.
(smiling) i do not know.
this little, old lady lives for my career.
when they dumped me off of days of our lives she almost died.
(smiling) no, smile!
not that face, smile!
everybody smile!
(they all smile.)
soon, soon, I am going to be on soon.
there i am!
(points to the screen, of course it is not him.)
no-no-no, that-that is me, that is me.
(to ross in the kitchen) all right, it is another commercial; i still have not told her!
i know, i know!
what am i going to do?
(thinks) ooh!
(dejected) yeah, all right.
(thinks of something.)
ooh!
(he quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)
(entering) hey!
is the show still on?
(says hi to his grandma) look!
oh!
(pointing out the window.)
is that the pope?!
(chandler and his grandma turn to look and joey slips a tape into the vcr.)
oh, here i am, here is my big scene!
(on the tape) all right back off!
i got to gun!
I am not afraid to use it!
that is right!
(on the tape) now, i want to a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars.
(the duck quacks, to the duck) choo!
choo!
choo!
(to the imaginary cops) filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if i do not get it…(the duck quacks louder) choo!!
and if i do not get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I am going to shoot this duck!
(on the tape) I am comin' out!
(he opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
(to his grandmother) that is uh, scenes from next week's show.
next week's!
(entering with monica) hey, is, is, is chandler here?
well, i was thinking about that and i, i think the best way would be, to not.
it will kill him.
i mean it will, it will just kill him.
(looking out the window) ewww!
ugly naked guy is using his new hammock.
it is like a play-doo fat factory.
what did they do?
hey-hey, ross?
I have got a science question.
if the homo sapiens, were in fact ‘homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?
hey-hey, I am not judging.
I would really prefer a mountain bike.
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.
do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
oh, you want something serious.
y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas.
those are dead serious.
(stopping him) no, no, you can not, you can not, okay, you can not, you can not buy her pearls, you just can not, you can not, you can not.
oh god.
uh, okay, here is the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is... okay.
i went down to the ‘mattress king’ showroom and, and i saw janice, kissing her ex-husband.
they were in his office.
I am telling you man, i saw it.
I am not wrong!
i wish i was.
I am sorry.
bet that barium enema does not sound so bad now, huh?
you said number two.
i know.
(giggles harder) uh.
ugly naked guy looks awfully still.
(phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
I am tellin’ ya, he has not moved since this morning.
well, there is one way.
his window’s open, i say, we poke him.
hey!
y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get chinese food?
well, now we got a reason.
well, we are fashioning a very long poking device.
hey uh, what is a matter?
oh my god, is she going back to him?
what are you ah, what are you going to do?
well, it does not matter what i would do.
all right, you are probably not going to want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (chandler gets ready to throw another dart) i would ah, i would bow out.
they have a kid together, y'know.
they are like, they are like a family, and if, i do not know, there is chance they could make that work, i know i would not want to be the guy who stood in the way of that.
are you okay?
do you want to ah, come poke a nude guy?
all right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately i have a lot of experience in that area.
all right, ladies and gentlemen, let us poke.
(they start to advance the giant poking device) steady.
steady.
okay, a little higher.
careful of the angle.
okay, okay, we are approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of ugly naked guy, so that we actually see him!)
thread the needle.
thread the needle.
okay, retract the device, retract the device.
hey, that is never going to make it all the way over here, buddy!
no, i-i just heard lunch.
but yeah, i can go.

(they all exit.)
(entering) hey!

(joey picks him up in a fireman’s carry and carries him out.)
here we go.
(entering) that is my line!
(he walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) i can take it from here, thanks.
(to all) dearly beloved, I am sorry I am a little late.
you may be confused by this now, (he is still in costume) but you will not be memorial day weekend 2002. well, let us get started before the groom takes off again.
huh?
(monica is shocked and looks around.)
we are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
I have known monica and chandler for a long time, and i can not imagine two people more perfect for each other.
and now, as I have left my notes in my dressing room.
we shall proceed to the vows.
monica?
chandler?
you may not kiss the bride.
so, i guess by the powers vested in my by the state of new york and the internet guys, i now pronounce you husband and wife.
oh wait!
do you take each other?
yeah you do!
aw crap!
okay—uh…uh let us-let us do the rings.

(tosses him the loaf.)
eggs and milk are in the fridge.
thanks.
(sitting up from the couch) hey mon, do you have another pillow?
(holds up one.)
y’know, something a little snugglyer?
well, the duck… uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
(sitting up again) guys!
guys!!
you got to let me nap!
ugh, I am going to get cranky!
yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
all right, I am going to go!
(gets up and heads for the door.)
i do not know!
but he did not eat your face cream!
hey little buddy, how are you feeling?
(the duck does not get sick and joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.)
what the hell is in that face cream?
(he is about to try out the couch but notices the bed in rachel’s room.
he walks into her room and feels the bed.)
that is so soft.
(he pulls back the comforter.)
pillowcases!
(he climbs in and groans in delight.
suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book.
he opens it and starts to read from it.)
(in his head.)
zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
her father, the vicar…(stops reading and thinks.)
the vicar?
(continues reading) …would not be home for hours.
her loins were burning.
she threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his…(out loud.)
whoa!
(reads on in silence.)
whoa-ho-ho-ho!
this is a dirty book!
(continues to read.)
sweepin’.
why?
turn you on?
huh.
what if i was sweeping a chimney?
where are you going?
the vicar will not be home for hours.
where do you think, (pause) zelda?
yeah i did!
okay, look I am sorry, i went in there to take a nap and i know i should not have, but you got porn!
you got porn!
hey rach.
hey rach, do you smell smoke?
no-no-no, I am serious.
you do not smell it?
something is on fire.
oh, y’know what?
it is probably just your burnin’ loins.
dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
gotcha.
hello, zelda.
the vicar!
like a goalie, right?
all right, I am sorry.
rach i—rach I am sorry.
okay?
I am sorry!
maybe i can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
(giggles.)
huh?
(nervously backing away) i-i-i-i did?
(he puts a stool in front of her.)
this body?
(he backs into the kitchen.)
hey-hey, you are startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.
i do not want to, I am scared.
hey rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
(laughing) you fall for it every time!
i just want you to say it once in a while.
what?!
phoebe!
no they are not!
they are ugly and stupid and delicious!
she is?
yeah.
but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
but you got to have turkey on thanksgiving!
i mean, thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like fourth of july with no apple pie!
or friday with no two pizzas!
no there will not!
i promise i will finish that turkey!
that is right!
‘because I am a tribbiani!
(to rachel) and this is what we do!
i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we do not read a lot or run very fast, but damnit!
we can eat!
let me explain to you how the human body works.
i have to warm my stomach first.
eatin’ chips is like stretching.
do not worry, tribbianis never get full.
(to monica) who the hell is this guy?
oh hey!
that is it?!
even if nobody helps me i can eat that no problem.
at least give me a challenge!
(quietly) oh.
how-how big is that?
(to rachel) it is like me when i was born.
(to monica) seriously, who is this guy?
I am afraid I am going to need proof.
you are my everest.
oh yes i do.
otherwise what is next?
today I am just a guy who can not finish a turkey, but tomorrow I am the guy who eats half a powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge?
no!
no, i just…i just—i got to change my pants.
(gets up and heads for the door.)
jeans have no give.
(exits.)
(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) all right where is that turkey!
not now!
these are my thanksgiving pants!
well that is it.
I am done.
whew!
(wipes his forehead.)
there come the meat sweats.
(chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
no just, nobody press on my stomach.
whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there?
what is that?
pie?
ah, just cut me a little sliver.
(monica prepares to cut a little sliver.)
a little bigger.
(monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.)
little bigger.
(monica moves the knife again.)
what?!
are you afraid you are going to run out?!
cut me a real piece!
(entering) hey guys!
am i psyched?
the lead in my own tv series?
I have dreamed about this for years!
why have i not been preparing?!
but i got to act with a robot pheebs, and-and i do not know anything about technology!
i can not even use chandler’s computer except to find porn!
and-and that is only ‘because it is right there when you turn it on!
wow!
huh?
(picks up the phone) mac macaveli, private investigator!
okay.
hey uh, when do i get to meet the robot?
okay.
oh wow!
he is so lifelike!
(starts touching the guy’s cheeks) unbelievable!
(he starts tugging on the guy’s ears.
(slaps wayne on his cheek) how do you do there, wayne?
(backs away.)
okay.
sorry about that…(mimics that cheek thing he just did.)
uh, so where is c.h.e.e.s.e.?
(laughs) this is like the temporary robot, right?
well, i-i just, i just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know?
like the terminator or uh, when i first saw you.
I am sorry, it just—i do not know it does not really look like it can do anything.
hey!
pretty great!
except i did get a little attitude from the robot.
anyway, it was not the robot, it was the guy who controls him.
yeah, he does not like me.
he had c.h.e.e.s.e.
knock over the sandwich right when i was reaching for one!
ohh!
i may have to, i hate to do it, but I am the star!
y’know?
there is a limit to how many sandwiches i can eat off the floor.
(his cell phone rings) excuse me.
(answers it, on phone) joey tribbiani.
wow!
I am the lead in mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.!!
apparently, there is like a million guys out there that can play mac, and there is only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
i did not know he could get me fired!
what am i going to do?
thanks, but i kind of have a problem to deal with here.
that is not a bad idea.
yeah.
okay, but if i got to turn on the charm tomorrow I am not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
(starts to leave, but stops and turns to phoebe.)
well, actually i got a little bit saved for you pheebs.
(exits.)
morning!
hey, how is my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
(pats c.h.e.e.s.e.
on the head.)
okay!
(he yanks his hand away.)
all right.
umm, all right wayne, level with me.
okay?
i-i keep hearing all these rumors that i might get fired.
okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!
come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!
i mean, i love-i love this little guy!
(he grabs c.h.e.e.s.e.’s arm and pulls it off at the elbow.)
ah-ah!!
(wayne is shocked.)
okay, that is why you did not want me to touch him right?
here you go!
okay?
(hands wayne the arm and he goes to fix it.
meanwhile joey starts to berate himself.)
stupid!
i can not believe it!
god!
(a very beautiful woman walks by.)
(to her) hey, how you doing?
(he and her go over to talk and wayne looks on with envy.)
i can not believe I am going to lose this job!
yeah!
help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
yeah?
well, i do not want to talk to you wayne!
i hate you!
you ruined my life!
oh, chandler, wayne.
wayne, chandler.
(they shake hands.)
(incredulous) why should i help you?!
(happily) what do you need?
yeah?
what are you in love with her or something?
oh wow wayne, it is not really something you can teach y’know?
it is pretty much something you are born with if you—(off chandler’s look)—you-you can teach it!
I will show you right how to do it.
well, it turns out you were right c.h.e.e.s.e.
you got it!
and the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair.
nice catch c.h.e.e.s.e.!
(pauses as he waits for c.h.e.e.s.e.’s next line.)
it is your line c.h.e.e.s.e.!
(suddenly c.h.e.e.s.e.
goes crazy and starts flinging it is arms and advancing on joey behind the desk.)
wayne!
wayne!!
hey everybody!
uh, I would like you to meet janine.
she is-she is going to be my new roommate!
yeah, she is going to live with me!
i did not know that!
well, what a pretty last name!
(shocked) from the land down under?
i did not know that either!
you are a dancer?
she-she is a dancer!
oh, hey let me.
(opens the door for janine and after he closes the door behind her gasps ecstatically.)
of course i did.
"when can you move in?"
ugh, i cannot wait to ask her out!
oh god, yeah.
(happily) okay!
oh, oh, you are right!
i do not want that.
i can not date her!
well, that is going to be tough mon.
i mean it is hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
you a little sad about that sweetheart?
(jumps out of the box) i gotcha!!
boy, it was so hard not to laugh, i tell ya.
hey, hey, the place looks great!
(raises his hand) i do not!
no, i want to live with the super-hot australian dancer.
yeah.
well, so far yeah.
but it is tough you know?
i got all this built up flirting energy and i do not know how to get rid of it.
(gives chandler the "joey-love," look.)
how you doin?
(voice cracking) ohhhh man no-no-no-no-no, it is-it is uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, i need to do my stretches too.
(starts to stretch, groans painfully) (jumps up and yells) uh-uh nothing.
i-i-i-i did not want you to touch me because I am -I am all sweaty from the workout.
i better hit the shower.
(goes into the bathroom and comes back out quickly) oh my god!
(entering) look, what am i going to do?
I am not flirting but still, I am drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!
(tries to put his feet on the coffee table...they will not reach and looks around.)
what the hell's going on over here?!?!?
(points to chandler) monica's going to kill you!
look i need your help, i have to do something to-to repel this woman!
wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
no-no-no I have seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it.
what is your secret?
this is great, this is great, what else, what else?
uh, do not you mean "for whom?"
pizza, heh, its not like i never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
all right, all right, let us just get this out in the open okay?
you are hot.
I am lovable.
clearly there is a vibe going on between us.
but, we are roommates and it is a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
no, no, no, I am telling ya.
imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay?
so the question is, what do we do?
oh!
oh!
i see what happened.
it is because i was trying to repel you.
right?
believe me, you would feel a lot different if i turned it on.
oh, i do.
(gives her the joey-love look.)
how you doin?
what?!?!
oh dear god!
oh uh, ordinarily i would love too, but i am just swamped right now.
(brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but does not move from his chair.)
I am missin’ picture time?!
(jumps over to look, ross glares at him and he retreats.)
(to ross) congratulations!
you just got married!
hey-hey-hey, hey that is your wife you are talking about!
who was that?
you hung up on the pizza place?
i do not hang up on your friends.
oh, what is wrong?
then why did i ask?
is that college talk for horny?
good, i uh, i saw a pretty big pigeon.
yeah, i got to, i got to go to my room too.
good night.
(they both enter their rooms.)
(entering) i can not do it!
you are rachel!
you are my friend!
but plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
i know!
do you want to do it?
all right, me neither!
i was just testing you!
this conversation never happened!
good night!
get back in there!
(rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
and i got to go sell some christmas trees.
what?
me having a job?
well, I am pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day.
hey, phoebe listen, you got this all wrong.
those trees were born to be christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
hey.
what, what are you doing here?
look now, phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their christmas.... sure.
all right.
oh, that is, that is ah, one of the old ones, he is just taking it to the back.
well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
well, they go into the chipper.
(to the guy operating the chipper) hey!
hey!!
(makes the ‘cut it’ motion with his hands) all right, I will take a box of the cream filled jesus’s.
look rach, was not this supposed to a temporary thing?
i thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
if you ask me, as long as you got this job, you have got nothing pushing you to get another one.
you need the fear.
(entering, interrupting rachel) hey!
i got great news!
what?
rachel, listen, have you ever heard of fortunata fashions?
well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening.
so, you want me to see if i can get you an interview?
not a problem.
and now for the great news.
only if you think it is better than this... (holds up an aerosol can) snow-in-a-can!!
i got it at work.
mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of christmas lookie.
okay, and ah, this one here is a douglas fir, now it is a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
yeah, the ah, trees that do not fulfil their christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.

yeah, I will grab this one.
(he follows her upstairs.)
(entering) hey chandler!
listen, sorry i did not stop by last night but i had a date.
well check it out, i was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
yeah!
two days ago.
oh yeah?
well, i sorta am.
i mean yeah, I am dating this girl who is also seeing another guy.
but, i do not know, I am not to worried about it.
obviously!
so, how do we decide?
(not buying it) uh-huh.
uh-huh.
or, or I am the one who dates her.
yeah-yeah i like that but just to go in another direction… yeah well we should order some food then.
(smiling) that sounds fair.
ah yeah—wait a second now!
look we are going to have to set a spending limit on the date.
i do not have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
all right, well i guess I will just have to do what i do on dates.
yeah.
uh, (thinks)…a slice…(thinks)…six dollars?
okay.
can i borrow 94 dollars?
(entering) hey!
i just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.
yeah.
what time are you meeting her?
wow, that is in like 20 minutes.
you would better get dressed.
oh.
well good!
(to himself) for me.
(he picks up a jar of lotion.)
what is this?
did you give yourself a facial?
okay dude!
(finds a receit.)
hey you uh, you sent kristen flowers.
you spent a hundred dollars.
that is the limit.
you are screwed!
oh-oh!
so that is the way it is going to be huh?
yeah i can break the rules too y’know!
i do not know.
y’know what ross?
I am not going to let you get away with this!
well we will see!
yeah bye-bye!
(exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.)
hey!
so just a light layer?
(entering) kristen?
hi!
oh i like this place.
and technically, technically I am not breaking any rules so i… hi!
sure!
i would love to wait with you guys!
thanks!
(sits down.)
a woman in a man’s body.
so y’know ross it is funny ‘because, you look familiar to me too.
have you ever been married?
so you have just married the one time then?
(laughs that one off) yeah.
so uh ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup?
was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
no.
it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
fine!
have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
monkey lover!
when do you think we lost her?
yeah!
(monica goes in the bedroom.)
y’know, she could use a little…(whistles that she needs to do what they are doing.)
(something happens on the game.)
oh nice shot!!!
(they all cheer.)
(entering) hey!
I am all packed and ready to go!
mmh-mmh.
barbados!
all right, let us do it!
5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
i know, there are going to be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
(a woman goes towards them) (to charlie) i think I have been recognized, this happens all the time!
that... never happens... no, god, no!
no!
no no, I am an actor.
you would probably recognize me from a little show called "the days of our lives".
(thinking he is kidding) ok, ross!
it is... it is fun, yeah!
no, i-i play doctor drake ramoray.
you do not own a tv?
what is all your furniture pointed at??
yeah!
how you doing?
yeah alright!
hey, hey!
you said you are going to wear a thong, where is the thong?
you really should have been more clear about that!
hey!
oh!
ah!
eh... britney spears!?
you could say: "hey kenny, how come you are not britney spears?"
(looks at ross matter-of-factly) wha...?
you are going to go now?
i thought we could hang out?
(smiling) will you wear a thong?
oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
yeah, yeah.
I have got tons of stuff i could do.
I am going to hit the beach, go swimming... no, why?
oh man!
i was not going to swim, i was going to dig a hole!
(removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack) oh!
hey!
thank god you guys are here!
everything is upside down here!
it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!
come on, I will show you guys where to check in (joey, chandler and david leave) hey guys!
damnit!
oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?
(chandler looks annoyed at him and joey leans in to him) oh!
secret teapot?
it is really gone?
i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions.
hey do not worry about that!
i mean, ross needs you!
and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can.
oh, oh!
any chance any of this happened in a "galaxy far, far away"?
(ross turns aroud and glares at him.
joey and rachel decide to leave).
I am so bored!
stupid rain, we... we can not do anything.
hey, it has not come to that yet.
(stopping the waiter) hey hey hey!
do not mind if i do!
hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
(walking to a table with many badges on it) i know we are not, but (he picks up a badge) frank medeio and... (picks up another badge) eva trorro... womba... kate miller it is.
(he picks up the kate miller badge and sticks it on rachel's breast) in that case should i make sure it is on real good?
(he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it) well, who knew?
pharmacists are fun.
not enough pills in the world, rach.
what about you, you are the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
but what about back home, anything going on there?
anybody you like?
there it is, you are blushing!
you like someone.
tell me who it is.
who is it?
(tickles her a little) tell me who it is.
come on who?
who do you like?
tell me.
you are not getting away that easy.
who do you like, who?
what?
why not?
rach, who can you not get?
(eagerly) yeah, who is that?
yeah.
right, of course.
hey, did you guys finish the speech?
alright, hey look, and this is not over, because i really want to know who... yeah.
(they leave) night.
he said "erectus"!
no, he really said it.
erectus?
yeah, and so funny!
hey!
(stands up) as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling!
some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
(smiles ecstatic) (disappointed) oh... oh, but that is ok, I will find someone else to do it...
I will do it alone, but... i do not know what happens if the sea turtle catches you... (interrupting her) hey!
do not worry about it!
it was fine!
i ended up having the best time with rachel!
i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on ross's speech... (pulls a face) (bewildered) oh!
oh, well!
at least we are both having fun!
yeah!
a little bit, yeah... yeah... i think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?
(downhearted) hey... uh... charlie and i broke up.
oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
no, it is not, we have nothing in common!
i mean, she should be with someone like... ross!
you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too!
man, smart people are dull!
(laughing sarcastically) ok, rach!
i feel so stupid, you know?
why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls?
oh, c'mon, i mean, there is you, then there is charlie, and it is like... (sighs) what the hell is my problem?
oh!
(he falls back on the bed) (sitting up again) I am telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me!
but then who?
the waitress i went out with last month?
(gives her a meaningful look) (stands up) no-no-no-no, no!
who, who were you talking about?
ok!
all right, well...
I am going to see if i can get a room for the night and I will...
I will see you later!
you like me?
(shuts the door) (shocked) that is a huge thing!
what... for how long?
(outraged) a month??
(stands up) i just have one question!
(desperate) what the hell are you doing???
uh, am i curious?
i mean, i am as curious as... as...
george!!
curious george (see link)!
you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
yeah, he had a paper route.
no, i know, yeah i know we are great but rach no... this... this can not happen!
(charmed, but then recoiling) no, no!
it can not happen at all!
because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?
(in a trembling voice) i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no!
(sighs) i could not do it to ross!
i know, i know!
but I have thought about it a lot since, and it just would not be right... (painfully) I am sorry...!
no!
no-no-no-no-no-no!
hey!
hey, we will be fine!
li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
no big deal!
yeah!
I will see ya later!
yeah!
hey!
listen, do you guys think i have a chance with janine?
well all right then, i guess i should not get to excited about the fact (excitedly) that i just kissed her!
oh we kissed it up real nice.
i came over here to tell you guys.
okay.
(they kiss.)
okay.
(they kiss.)
okay, I am all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
(she kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)
have you kissed her yet?
it is awesome!
i could do it forever!
y’know what?
she-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
i hate pottery barn too.
they kicked me out of there just because i sat on a bed!
(indignant) i was tired!
hey!
i made that for her!
yeah!
i made it of this fruit bowl i found in the garbage.
and chandler i can not believe i let you pay for this one.
(they hug and he whispers in his ear.)

‘because that would kind of be a problem.

I am sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends!
y’know?

i know, but do not you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh?
she will come around i promise.
(shouting) i can hear you!
(entering) hey!
so uh, what are you guys doing?
look, come on you guys, you said you were going to try!

i really want you guys to get along.
just please come to the movie with us.
i mean you owe me!
that is right!
i helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship.
huh?
i helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and i looked like an idiot!
and i was humiliated.
and i only made 200 dollars!
you do not think i know that!

these people are my friends; you can not treat them that way.
i know!
i know!
and I am going to talk to them about it.
they mean so much to me.
they… they are like my family.
if you guys are going to be fighting all the time, i-i… i do not think we can be together.
it just, it just can not work.
it can not.
(starts to break up) I am very upset.
yeah!
yeah!

he broke up with julie.
well, go hug her, for god's sakes.

oh-ho!
i bet the british version is gooooood!
well, that is really a different question.
well, there was that one time that monica and rachel got together.

hey!

i did not know it was an auction!
i figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
i do not know!
charity?
oh hi!
just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
(to rachel) hey, i was pretty close.
(she just glares at him.)
uhh, so bad news.
umm, i can not buy the boat, i do not have any money.
so uh listen, i think I am going to take off now.
(starts to get up.)
well, what am i going to do rach?!
i do not have that kind of money!
okay.
look, i do not know why the kids need a youth center anyway!
y’know?
they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine!
rach!
rachel!
okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
(to phoebe) oh and uh the guy who got the paris trip is at table four.
uhh, excuse me is there a mr. bowmont at this table?
ahh, yes.
(pushes rachel in front of himself so that she could do the talking.)

chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.

(all excited) i have not totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
monica face it, chandler is against marriage.
and-and always will be!

where the hell have you been?!
richard told monica he wants to marry her!
yeah!
yeah, I have been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes would not keep flying off!

hey look, i want to switch to rachel!
okay that is fair.

she had a bag and she left.
she was all crying.
she-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
i-i did!
i told her everything, chandler!
but she would not believe me.
to her parent’s i think and she said you should not call her.
but if i were you i would.
i am so sorry man.
(yelling through the door) can we come it yet?!

my entire family thinks i have vd.
chandler, will you just come in already?
hey, monica, i got a question.
i do not see any tater tots.
but my mom always makes them.
it is like a tradition.
you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot!
it is bad enough i can not be with my family because of my disease.
the balloon?
wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
that tone will not make me go any faster.
that one will.
nope, not that one.
hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.
you do the math.
hey, we all had better plans.
this was nobody's first choice.
you call that delicious?
I have got to see this.
all right ugly naked guy!
oh, i will.
the bigger half.
(enters the room) hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
it is a one-woman play called "why do not you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
you guys are going to have a great time, i promise!
i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can not go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
(lifts rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) hey, here you go.
(entering the room) hey!
what is happenin'?
oh, I would love to, but i got to get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first (yelling) stupid jane rogers!!

i do it every year.
i did not have to tell you that!!
I am stupider than jane rogers!!
yeah... yeah... (smiling) i can not believe you guys went for that one!
you are fine, ok?
but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
(speaking aloud) please, i was trying to be nice, you are the worst one!
ok, ok!
fine!
you can come, but do not tell anybody else.
it is up on the roof at 8.
(sounds tired) hey you guys, I am turning in.

what party?
(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) ok... i mean... (to charlie after covering himself up again) nice to meet ya!
(charlie waves hesitantly and joey leaves) (to some people) hey!
hey alright!
hey, glad you could make it (shakes a man's hand) thanks for coming.
hey, that is why i did not invite you.
you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something... hey ross, this is one of my co-stars, dirk.
(to dirk) dirk, this is my good friend ross.
(ross and dirk shake hands) it is a science.
hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or... monica!
(to rachel) what have you got there?
ah, let me see!
(she hands him a pile of tissues) damn, that is a lot of guys!
are you a little slutty?
(browsing the tissues) let me see if i approve any of these clowns.
this guy wears a rug (discards one).
this guy's canadian (discards another).
and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and i do not feel any different.
(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass... nothing major, it is just that, you know, they are not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
that is true.
but you know what, it does not matter because i already know who you are going to go home with tonight.
me.
yes, because we live together, that is a joke!
gotcha.
how long do you have to go for?
a year?!
wait a minute, you can not go to tulsa.
maybe you forgot, but we have got tickets to the jets game next week.
we were going to go see the jets!
i can not believe you guys are moving.
here you are (hands rachel a cup of coffee) (laughs) uhuh.
(laughs) i know, yeah.
i feel like we are all growing up.
person named wiener, god that kills me.
(laughs) actually, you know what?
i am.
that whole thing with rachel made me realize that maybe I am ready for a more serious relationship.
you know?
like I would like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady.
and looks are not as important as...nah, she is got to be hot.
i can do that, yeah.
how is friday?
yeah!
(laughs) poophack... (laughs) (laughs) hey!
(realizes that he has forgotten all about the double date) oh my god!
yeah, so you found someone for me.
you did not forget?
no.
mike.
damnit!
is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
why did i have to say mike?
i do not know a mike!
why could not i have said... (looks through his address book) there is no guy in there!
mike!!!
(checks him out) okay!
(walks over to his table and sits down with him) everything is going to be fine.
just follow my lead, okay?
all you have to do is pretend to be mike.
atta boy!
okay, look... (laughs) from school.
mike, 'attorney at law'!
what?
that is the kind of thing you usually run by me.
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike.
no, no, that is not what i meant.
let us get you a cocktail.
yeah, that is because we had a bit of a falling out.
mike hit my mom with a car.
that is okay mike, i have forgiven you.
and now we are friends again everything's great!
please, we are trying to have a conversation.
(pushes the wine glass closer to mary ellen.)
what?!
(laughs) of course we do!
mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school.
yeah, where we pretend we do not know each other.
we played all kinds of games.
(to mike) hey, remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool?!
what are you doing?
i said seven!
(holds up six fingers.)
(realizes his mistake) argh!!!
because i forgot about our date, I am so sorry.
look phoebe I am so sorry!
hey, look, if you do not like this guy i can find you a better one.
(looks around) mike!!
mike!!
(to mary ellen) you are leaving too?
good night!
(walks in) look at this.
my two best friends!
I am mad at you for leaving!
you are nothing but a big leaver.
big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
dude, you see right thru me!!
(they hug) (joey heads for the door and pushes chandler's suitcase on the way out.)
(on the phone with chandler) double promise?
call me when you land.
okay, bye.
(he hangs up the phone.)
he had to board.uhm... oh... i do not know, it is too hard.
oh... food.
no, sex.
food!
sex!
food!
se-i do not know!
good god, i do not know, i want girls on bread!
chandler?
forty-five minutes?
well, something is not right.
i just can not believe he would do this to monica!
hey, is uhm... is chandler here?
(walking towards her to hold her and support her) monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
(to chandler) you son of a bitch!
i knew he could not be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
(clearly shocked) what?
should not we all vote on stuff like this?!
no, no, it is not, do not listen to him!
(to ross) I am going to thump you!
(points his fist at him) is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food?
(walks towards the fridge) because i can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) i really, really think i can!
what the hell are you doing?
(he has a turkey on his head) it is stuck!!!
i put it on to scare chandler!
it smells really bad in here.
it is joey.
(shocked) dah!!
(chandler motions for him to calm down.)
oooooh!
big fat goalie.
weekend at bernie’s.
everyday use.
guest.
uhh, 11!
hey, do not get mad at us!
no one forced you to raise the stakes!
(panicking) dude!
he is right there!
rachel's right.
this is where you guys belong.
I am really sorry you guys.
you know, I am really sorry i was not more supportive before.
and about this nancy thing... if you are not sleeping with her, should i?
a meatball sub?
thanks!
(he got a meatball sandwich) (speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) what did they say?
what are you doing?
why are you doing this?
dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff.
you have got to spread it out a little, you know.
have not you ever been unemployed?
hey, do not get religious on me, ok. (ross looks a little confused.)
a guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing.
you know.
why do you think we have the comfortable chairs?
huh...come here…sit down.
(ross sits down.)
ready?
(joey flips the foot rest up.)
ahh!!
(he reclines the chair fully.)
ohh, yeah!!
huh?!
ohh, no, no.
we are not going to just sit.
(joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.)
shhh.
(it begins to ring.)
(in a high pitched female voice) hello mr. bing...i love you.
but, i love you.
and that is wednesday.
(he reclines in his chair.)
ohh.
so pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
how could i not get the part?
the play was about a 29-year-old italian actor from queens.
she is a woman!
(very discouraged) okay, is there anything else?
that part was perfect for me!
i can not believe i did not get it!
come on ross be realistic, y'know?
if i did write something, what are the chances i could get those guys to star in it?
wait a second, i could star in it!
i can not write!
y'know i mean i-i-I am an actor, i do not have the discipline that takes, y'know?
i can not do it.
really?
you would-you would do that for me?!
thanks!
done!
it is not.
(disappointed) oh.
hey, how do you spell suspicious?
because i think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
you are driving me crazy with that!
do not stop!
move the bowl further away!
ross could make that shot!
well, you suck!
but at least you suck at a man's game now.
chandler, i can not be playing games, ross is going to be home soon.
and i have to write five whole pages if I am going to stick to his schedule.
(jumping up) all right!
but uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
all right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
yeah, i think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
uh yeah, right here.
(he punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)
yeah, that is the uh, game we were playing.
you are right, you are right, I will get back to work.
hey!
(to chandler) i did not finish my five pages.
yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
dude, if you think fireball's relaxing, you have obviously have never played.
come on look guys, do not fight.
hey-hey guys, hey!
how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball?
huh?
I will go unhook the smoke detectors!
oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
do not you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—i did not have my camera!
yeah, wow, sorry rach.
they are brother and sister!!!
(entering) hey guys!
i was at the library all morning and i already finished my five pages for today!
no dude, ross tore up the tickets!
yeah, well, that is fine, but the important thing is that i finished it.
and uh, i think it is really good, but y'know it would really help me is if i could hear it.
so would you guys read it for me?
okay.
(reading.)
"it is a typical new york city apartment.
two guys are hanging out."
ross (points to him.)
oh no!
no-no, keep reading!
the good part's coming up.
keep going.
a handsome man enters.
(playing the part of the handsome man.)
hey!
how is it going guys?
i do not know what you two were talking about, but I would like to say thanks to both of you.
you, (ross) you would not let me give up on myself, and you (chandler) well you co-created fireball.
the end.
no-no, this only took five minutes.
i spent the rest of the day coming up with new, ultimate fireball.
(takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.)
ha-ha!
(reading the scene set up.)
okay, it is a typical new york city apartment.
two girls are just hanging out.
what?!
wait-wait-wait!
the handsome man was about to enter!!
hey you guys.
i had to get out of the apartment.
janine is like stretching all over the place.
y’know, everywhere i look she is like… (he imitates her stretching) i like her so much!
i know.
and she is so sweet.
i just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.
totally!
i would love to spend new year’s with you.
did she just ask me out on a date?
oh.
maybe.
but hey i know how i can find out.
we are going to a new year’s eve party, right?
so at midnight, i can kiss her.
and if she kisses me back, great!
y’know?
but if she says ‘dude, what the hell are you doing?’ i can say ‘it was not me, it was new years!’ ok, listen I have been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright?
it is a show, but we are just dancing, ok?
it is no big deal.
the important thing to remember – stay cool.
ross!
so when is it going to air?
really?
what do you mean?
uh-huh.
no-no-no-no-no we came together!
no-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, i really like her and i think i have a shot.
hey-hey dancer girl!
can i go to the bathroom?
i just.. (the girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) here we go.
(he walks away to find monica and ross doing a really out of place dance) looking good gellers!
hey!
tall guy!
hey, listen, i wanted to talk to you about that girl that you are dancing with.
yeah, yeah, okay.
uh, look buddy, i came with that girl, and i had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I am trying to win her over, so i was wondering if.. oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she is real, uh, mellow!
well, i was hoping after tonight that maybe i could you know… alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if you are right, you are right, what can i say, but hey oh no!
(he throws water on the guy’s pants) hey, now you are the one who wet his pants.
(he throws another handful on him and runs out) uh, take a look at the guy’s pants!
i mean, i know you told us to show excitement, but do not you think he went a little overboard?
yeah, take a hike wetpants!
no!
year!
happy no year!
home sweet home, huh?
nice to, uh, get back to reality.
plus we know how the new year’s going to go off.
i guess there is no reason for all that y2k panic, y’know?
anyway, g’night!
yeah?
oh, yoii.
what was that for?
really?
in the moment, i really wanted to kiss you too.
in the moment.
but only in the moment.
so do ya want to kiss again?
no.
3, 2, uh, yeah, okay.
except i sorta felt like i needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
probably kill myself!
hey, if little joey's dead, then i got no reason to live!
you are?
ross, I am sorry.. ...ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven.
see, i told you!
less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
(to ross) hey!
here is the birthday boy!
ross, check it out: hockey tickets, rangers-penguins, tonight at the garden, and we are taking you.

(kisses ross) so?

oh, you are fine, yeah, for a first job.
leetch spots messier in the crease- there is the pass!
(he kicks it to ross, but ross is staring into a shop window.)

(they turn to stare at him.)
what?
thought we were trying to find stuff.

(ross gives him a look.)
oh.
whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake!

really?
oh, ah- the kid has it.
(grabbing the candy bar) yeah I will take that.

but i-i-i can not stay too long, i got to get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and i got to look good.
I am supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
(everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.)

(to phoebe) hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?

‘sup with the whack playstation, ‘sup?!

now, i can pass for 19 right?!
really?
seriously?
(gasps) I am 30!
(realizes) aww crap!
psss, that is whack!
yeah!
well, i think we will see if they actually let you play.
huh?
i mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "you look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "no you do not."
would not she?
would she?
(he smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.)
you ate my candy bar!
they break your heart, do not they?
yeah!
if you want to sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
what?!
what is wrong with my eyes.
and that will get rid of my wisdom?
look, I will come to the party but I am not dressing up.
no way!
look, halloween is so stupid!
dressing up, pretending to be someone you are not… that hot girl from their wedding?
well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—ooh-ooh, leatherface from the texas chainsaw massacre—no-no-no!
slutty leatherface.
(entering) hey!
yes i did!
I am chandler.
(looks at chandler) dude, what happened?
okay.
I am chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)
when have i ever done that?!
(and does the sound again.)
(sees ross) hey all right, ross came as doody.
yeah.
exclusively.
catwoman, hands down.
but between you and phoebe, I would have to give the edge to phoebe.
are you kiddin’?
phoebe lived on the street.
okay?
plus, she is got this crazy temper.
she—she is not standing right behind me is she?
I am not sure.
will you relax?!
what are you taking this so seriously for?
it does not matter.
i would say, "woman, please!"
(to monica) here comes the temper.
okay, here is a good one for ya.
who do think would win in a fight between ross and chandler.
so ross?
(to monica) hey-hey-hey, i think we might find out the answer to our question.
monica and i were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or ross?
so you think ross too?
hey monica!
(grabs her and pulls her into the living room.)
people came to see a fight, let us give ‘them what they came for!
yeah.
listen to the slutty nurse.
seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
rach?
(entering) pheebs come on!
bunny vs. doody!
we are waiting!
(they go inside.)
(to chandler and ross.)
okay.
okay guys, one match, winner take all.
(they grasp each other’s hand in preparation for battle.)
oh wait-wait!
what does the winner get?
(laughing) okay, if you say so.
all right, ready?
set!
go!
or equally weak.
(to her) you are a weird lady.
hey!
that is not so bad.
come on!
you are good with kids.
they are just crazy on halloween.
y’know, they are all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
absolutely!
halloween is the worst.
except for christmas…and their birthdays.
kind of get a little crazy during the summer too.
and anytime they are hungry or sleepy.
y’know, kids are tough.
good luck with that.
(walks away.)
uhhh, mine too!
yeah.
me too!
me too!
me too!
(yeah, he does the same thing.)
yeah, i got too excited!
(entering, depressed) hey.
i just got off the phone with estelle and guess what.
(pause, then very excitedly) i got the lead in a movie!!!!!!
it is called shutter speed, it is really cool!
yeah, umm, i meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right?
and then, she disappears… but i find out where she lives and when i get there this like old lady answers the door and i say, "where is betsy?"
right?
and she says, "betsy's been dead for 10 years."
and the best part is, we are filming in the desert outside vegas!
(to chandler) and you know what that means buddy!
road trip!
yeah, we can rent a car!
i just have to be there by tuesday!
all right!
thanks pheebs!
oh umm, not go.
i can not decide which route to take to vegas.
hey, you have traveled a lot right?
okay, so-so which route should i take the northern route or the southern route?
great!
problem solved!
well, back to square one.
(quickly) yes!
peanut butter!
a swimmer!
monica.
oh… huh, i always thought it would be rachel.
ascot!
north route!
wow!
that was incredible!
beard of bees, here i come!
hey man, what is up?
sure, what do you want to see?
oh, i know how we can decide.
phoebe, show him your game!
i do not know.
but hey, i know we can decide.
okay, I am going to ask you questions and you answer real quick.
okay?
what do you like better action or comedy?
who would you rather sleep with monica or rachel?
oh, I am sorry.
i forgot you had that whole rachel thing.
hey!
you ready to go?
man, i wish ross was coming with us!
y'know?
I am going to miss him!
uh no, not really.
it is an independent film y'know?
so we do not have a real big budget.
i figured I would just stay in your room.
oh yeah!
for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in joey's pocket.
did you not hear the plot of the movie?
"she is been dead for ten years."
I am going to be a millionaire!
hey!
you got it!
bye-bye!
anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
see ya!
(walks out.)
man, I am getting pretty tired.
you are might have to take over soon.
do not worry, it is out there!
(just then a horn honks and joey quickly looks at the road.)
i think i just need lunch.
you want to eat?
(pulls out the twenty) my treat!
yeah.
okay.
ross's treat!
where do you want to eat?
ooh, hey, i know how we can decide!
all right, uh, I am going to ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast.
okay?
so uh, clear your mind clear it right out!
clear it out!
clear!
okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
is this movie going to be my big break?
(shocked) what?!
dude you said, "no!"
you do not think this is going to be a big break for me?
i do not believe this!
what are you talking about?!
I am the lead in a movie!
y'know what?
i do not need this!
okay?
i do not know why you are dumping all over my big break.
is that why you are on this trip, huh?
make me feel like a loser?
because if it is, I will tell ya, i-i-I would rather be alone.
not if you are going to be like this!
yeah!
i do not want you on the trip!
fine!
(he slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.)
get out!
get out!!
(on a pay phone holding a box) not as upset as he is going to be when he finds out what i did with his sweater vests!
let us just say there is a well-dressed pack of dogs in ohio.
hey monica listen is-is phoebe there?
i got to ask her something about the car.
hey pheebs!
listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.
what-what is it?
hey-hey!
stanley!
hey-hey!
you are leading man is here!
let us get to work.
wh-what?!
why?!
(laughs) you are kidding right?
what?!
uh, hang out?!
how long?
no!
yeah.
thanks.
(the grip walks away.)
(reading the card.)
congratulations on your big break.
(on phone from vegas) hey monica, it is joey!
aw, come on!
it will be years before i forget you!
uh, well yeah-yeah, I have got all of that going on.
yeah, listen uh, i want you to make sure you tell chandler that he could not have been more wrong!
uh-oh!
i got to go monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
(to the family) sorry about that.
thanks for waitin'.
everybody smile!
(the picture is taken) okay, thanks a lot!
enjoy your stay at caesar's!
we hope it is toga-rrific!
(the family leaves.)
kill me.
kill me now.
hey!
why?
you can pee here!
we have only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think i got to get her something?
oh, i know... (entering the apartment) hey.
man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
it is two gifts in one.
it is a pen that is also a clock!
huh?
why not?
sure it is!
she needs a pen for work, she is writing, she turns it over.... "whoa!
it is time for my date with joey!"
she did not have a birthday while we were going out.
(whining and heading toward the door) look, it is too late, and i got an audition.
i can not shop anymore!
i... thanks, man.
and oh, while you are at it, could you get her a card?
or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
so, you just left?
her place was really that bad?
yeah.
wow.
thanks.
so, uh, what happened?
all right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
what kind of smell?
all right, listen, ross... you like this girl, right?
you want to see her again, right?
so you are going to have to do it in the mess!
yeah.
yeah!
all right!
now you go get that beautiful pig!
(ross hesitates, looks unsure) oink!
(entering) hey!
I am meeting kathy in ten minutes!
I have been looking all over for you!
our place, the hall!
i... (unimpressed) a book?
(suddenly interested) is it like a book that is also a safe?
you got it.
thanks man.
thanks for doing this, i owe you one.
(joey leaves, comes back in.)
oh, hey!
there was not any change from that twenty, was there?
wow.
that is almost as much as a new book.
hey!
oh, man, she loved it!
she is over there showing monica and rachel right now.
hey, listen, i got to tell ya, i feel kind of bad taking credit for this, because man, am i going to get a lot of credit for this!
hey!
you know, uh... [joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.]
chandler got you a gift, too.
yeah, he did, look... look, it is right there on the counter!
ha-ho-ho!
ah.
hm.
(to kathy) want to go to bed?
oh, uh... do not forget your coupon.
(tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room.
then goes inside).
(opening bedroom door) hey, that coupon expires, you know.
no way!
mr.salty is a sailor, all right, he is got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
her answer machine?
duh, where have you been?
man, we got to do something about that guy.
this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment.
it creeps me out!
i feel like i can not do stuff!
will you grow up?
I am not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I am cooking naked.
yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
maybe she never got your message.
(entering) he is back!
the peeper's back!
(ducking) get down!
(intrigued) yeah?
..naughty!
oh, hold up, I will walk out with you.
now, rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kind of little uniform, or- (rachel exits and slams the door in his face.)
that is fine, yeah... (watches them for a while) oh my.
(entering) hey, you know our phone's not working?
i tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
hey, so listen, i went across the street and talked to the doorman- i got the peeper's name!
can i use the phone?
(to monica) can i use your phone?
(on phone) yeah, the number for a sidney marks, please.
(on phone) yeah, is sidney there?
(listens) oh, this is?
(to the gang) sidney's a woman.
yeah.
yeah, so what?
(on phone) look, i live across the street, (walking to the window) and i know all about you and your little telescope, and i do not appreciate it, okay?
(listens) yeah, i can see you right now!
(listens) hello!
(listens) if i want to walk around my apartment in my underwear, i should not have to feel like—(listens)—thank you, but... that is not really the point... (listens) the point is that... (listens) mostly free weights, but occasionally.. (on phone) yeah, my neighbor... (listens) yeah, the brunette... (to monica) she says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
yeah, she said you looked like ingrid bergman that day.
big day.
all right, I will give you this, mr. peanut is a better dresser.
i mean he is got the monocle, he is got the top hat...
I am sorry, do i know you?
nothing, I am just practicing blowing you off because I am going to be a big movie star!
well, no not yet.
but the audition went really good.
oh, it is this big budget period movie about these three italian brothers who come to america around the turn of the century.
it is really classy!
oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next martin scorcese.
yeah, there is this guy from chicago who is supposed to be the next martin scorcese, all right?
but then this guy’s right after him.
(joey’s cell phone rings and he answers it.)
hello!
(to monica and phoebe) they loved me!
(on phone) oh my god!
are you kidding me?
i never rent a movie without it!
(listens) oh.
(listens) uh, okay uh let me call you back.
(hangs up.)
they want me to be totally naked in the movie!
i know!
my grandmother’s going to see this!
i do not know!
it is not like it is porn!
this is a serious, legitimate movie.
y’know?
and the nudity is really important to the story.
you are right.
maybe i should not even go on the call back.
well that is true.
and i am only naked in one scene.
plus it sounds really great.
my character’s catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl.
who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
it is really sweet and-and tender.
hey, I am back!
uh so, will-will i be reading the same scene again?
oh great!
y’know i would have been perfect for this part, but whatever!
y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie!
good day!
(starts to leave.)
and scene!
huh?
was not that fun?
we did a little improv there.
yeah!
okay!
so you-you-you-you were saying?
wow!
sure!
that is great!
yeah!
yeah sure, just long as it is handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
so…what?
yes!
no.
what?
barmifsaed?
nope.
yep.
that is right.
i do not know!
i really want this part!
and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes.
like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘them you can!
and just figure out how to do it later.
i kn-i know!
i know!
okay?
and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
i just have to call my agent and tell her i can not do the part.
(gets up for the phone.)
unless what?
like what?
wow!
this looks great!
and-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
thank god!
ah.
well maybe we just take that one away.
(picks it up and throws it away.)
thanks, you are such a good friend.
and this is so weird.
ow!
yeah.
the fruit roll up.
delicious.
wait a minute!
wait a minute!
we have a winner!
the silly putty!
it is not so silly anymore!
and what is cool is, the character is from naples, right?
my whole family’s from naples!
oh!
hey right!
not a problem.
(he starts taking off his clothes.)
i totally understand.
you need to y’know make sure i do not have any horrible scars or tattoos.
do not you worry; i have nothing to hide.
(he drops his pants and stands back up and looks down.)
so there you go, that is me.
(we cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through joey’s legs.)
one hundred percent natural!
(suddenly, there is a thud as something falls off.)
(everyone is shocked.)
i tell ya, that has never happened before.
you guys, can we please not watch this all right.
(on tv) oh, you said it mike.
(rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) aw!
there is got to be a better way!
can we please turn this off?
(on tv, finishing installing the milk master 2000) wow, it is easy.
(starts to poor the milk) now, i can have milk everyday.
(entering) hey!
maybe you can tell me.
my agent would like to know why i did not show up at the audition i did not know i had today.
the first good thing she gets me in weeks.
how could you not give me the message?!
how is it you?
yep, that is my audition.
well, estelle tried, you know.
the casting director told her that i missed my chance.
pheebs, you can not do that.
the casting director does not talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
what, what are you doing?
what are you doing?
hang up, hang up.
(reaches with his good arm, but phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can not because of the sling.)
i love that movie.
(joey is using it as a pillow) I am sorry, it just felt nice.
hey, i only got one good arm, you know.
you should be doing stuff for me.
go get me a sweater.
hey, you know about that?!
well, I have never been through the tunnel myself, because as i understand it, you are not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.
but, it seems to me it is pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.
it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!
if you are afraid of bugs.....get a bug.
right.
in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
oh, yeah.
go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
come on baby, come on!
thank you so much.
you were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there is this one other audition that i really, really want, and estelle could not get me in.
come on, please, it will be just this one more, well actually it is two.
yeah!
well, well really it is three.
please.
you are so good at it.
i love you.
nooo, four.
(entering) g. i. joe!
cool!
can i play?
pheebs!
there you are!
but phoebe, wait!
wait!
phoebe.
phoebe!
(catches her in the hallway) look listen, that tv movie i went in for?
did you hear anything?
i think i got a shot at it.
it is okay, these things happen.
I am, I am okay.
see.
(tries to smile, but fails horribly) no!
no, no you can not quit!
you are the best agent i ever had!
look pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can not take it personally.
they actually said that?
no, no, no, see that is why you have to do this job, agents always lie.
you know, estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way', but this, i can use this.
(in a very bad italian accent) i canna work on a new accent.
okay, shoot.
i did not get it?
okay, what else?
oh.
look, it is okay, no, no, no, really, look um, i really appreciate this pheebs, but i think I am going to have to go back to estelle.
yeah, well do not get me wrong, you are a better agent than she is, but at least with her i do not want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
you do, thanks.
wait a minute.
wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
(in a really, really bad italian accent) that is-ah what i suspected-ah.
uh, hey.
(afraid) yeah.
so he can not come?
seriously?
i am pretty wisdomous.
are you kidding?
phoebe, i would be honored.
(they hug) (takes her hand) listen, i hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) i do not want you to see your father cry, go to your room!
oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
hey, you are mike's parents, right?
ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
you know, on the one hand you are happy for them, but on the other hand it is hard to let go.
hey, I am not that fond of you either, ok buddy?
but I am just trying to be nice for the kids!
so, you know I am filling in for phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
oh, hey, my pleasure.
(he suddenly becomes very serious) so what are your intentions with my phoebe?
oh, a wiseacre.
(mike looks bewildered).
no, no, no, i understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?
is not that kind of unstable?
strike two!
strike three!
you only get one more, mike!
oh, man!
i would not have had breakfast if i knew there was going to be corsages!
(to mike) hello michael.
may i have a word with you, please?
have a seat.
(mike sits on his bed, and joey towers over him.
he starts talking in an italian godfather-type voice) last night, i tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) i cannot allow this.
more back talk.
and yes, i may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "family honor 2: thissa time itsa personal."
i want you to take this seriously!
phoebe is very very important to me, ok?
and i want to make sure that you are going to take care of her.
(very satisfied and smiling) that is what i wanted to hear!
because she is family, ok, and now you are going to be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
(almost crying) that was me!
I am glad we had this little talk.
(staring at the ice sculpture) how bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
(they all glare at him) hey, what are you guys going to do?
the blizzard.
i just saw on the news, it is like the worst snow storm in 20 years!
they already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
(opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside) i do not think they are.
yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
oh hey, do not worry.
I am still ordained from your wedding.
yeah, you would think I would give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway?
huhuh... i had to read the bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
friends, family, dog... thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event.
the cold has now spread to my special place... so I am going to do the short version of this.
phoebe and mike are perfect for each other.
and i know i speak for every one here... when i wish them a lifetime of happiness.
who has the rings?
(whispering to phoebe) okay... yeah?
oh, okay.
phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
i now pronounce you... husband and wife.
it was, yeah.
i kind of do not want it to end.
hey, you want to come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
nice.
oh hey, what about ross?
it is the chick!
she is…going through some changes.
good luck.
(to monica) and I am still right!
she is mad because i know today’s her laundry day and that means she is wearing her old lady underpants.
yeah, what is that about?
oh yeah?
ross, how many items left in that bag?
six.
all right, we will start with…apples.
okay.
uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
okay, the last thing… no-no, not for like another two weeks.
serious?
no!
all right, who-who makes up the questions?
huh.
i know.
animals dressed as humans.
(to chandler) the irish gig guy?!
it is all relative.
(to chandler) nana?
(answering the question) althea!
i took a shot.
hey, no way, that rooster’s family!
what do you have against the duck?!
he does not make any noise!
look, we are not going to… (shocked) dah!!
(chandler motions for him to calm down.)
oooooh!
okay.
big fat goalie.
weekend at bernie’s.
everyday use.
guest.
uhh, 11!
i call monica’s room!
sure i can, standard shotgun rules, I am sight of the room and i called it.
what?
hey—ooh pheebs, are they in there?
oh wow!
you can tell this soon.
what?!
you can not just ignore the bet!
it is a bet!
you bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!
hey, do not get mad at us!
no one forced you to raise the stakes!
but it is our apartment!
did you see the size of the closets?!
yep.
hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
die hard 2. oh, well we watch it a second time and its die hard 2!
and?
what are you talking about?
bitch.
well, i do not know!!
yeah.
yep.
yeah.
all right, well uh, I would better go.
yeah.
all right, I will talk to you later.
no!
never!
never!
(pause, then joey wants to shake ross’s hand.)
bye.
hey!
what is going on?
hey!
well i hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
(phoebe glares at him.)
hey-hey-hey-hey, i can help you decide who should do it!
yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you would handle maid of honor type situations.
like when i want a job, i go to an audition and if I am the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
oh uh, me and ross can be the judges.
hi.
uh hey look uh ross, look i think we need to talk about before.
yes we do!
now look, that was the best nap i ever had!!
come on!
admit it!
that was the best nap you ever had!
okay!
when?!
uh-huh!
i want to do it again.
why not?
fine!
do you want something to drink?
warm milk and excedrin p.m. (ross just leaves.)
okay, all right, this is how it is going to work.
we are going to give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
why is 10 the highest?
(crying) i do not want to marry chandler!
I have got cold feet.
no, one man for the rest of my life?
i do not know if i can do it!
this means I will never get to sleep with joey!
(out of his monica character) very good!
drawing on your own experience, i like that!
okay, phoebe… we are now in the ceremony, monica is about to say, "i do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling.
what do you do?
go!
yes!
excellent!
perfect score!
wow.
(to ross) good speech.
yeah.
and she is back in the game.
all right, well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well.
okay?
you should be proud of yourselves.
and-and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers.
well, except for rachel—damnit!
boy i tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
yeah!
i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
(raises his eyebrows, questioning ross to see if he wants to join him.)
no reason, I am just saying that uh… that is where I will be.
great nap.
(reacting first by jumping up) dude!
what the hell are you doing?!
god!
(heads for his room leaving ross.)
(to monica) hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
done.
so pheebs what is this guy like?
yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
yeah!
uh, y'know what, we are having second thoughts about our copying needs.
and we will need a little more time to think about it.
both of us?
(points to chandler and himself) we will be there.
uh, 10:30.
4:30. yeah.
hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
she was kidding about that right?
god, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
dude, i do not know.
yeah.
yeah, for sure.
okay.
probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes.
y'know, because you do not want to be doing something and then look up and see something you do not want to be seeing.
ah!!
okay!
eyes open at all times!
oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?
yeah, i guess, but what is like heads and what is tails?
so what are you going to do?
yeah, tell that to my uncle lenny.
nothing, he is just really believes in that.
monica?
what time is it?
but it is dark out.
i guess I will get washed up then.
watch that sunrise.
(he goes into the bathroom.)
hey!
does not seem like it is going to work, i mean… hi!
so I am thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
(holding a box) well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything?
well, when ross said rachel at the wedding, i figured it was going to happen again, so i hid this in here.
you do not know how long we are going to be in here!
we may have to repopulate the earth.
hey, you are back!
how was your conference?
oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
hey, you are back too!
hey, how was your chef thing?
(sticking his head out the door) what are you guys woofing about?
nooooo!!!
y'know what?
now that i think about it, i constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
you want my advice?
you are not going to like it.
you got married to fast.
i told ya.
man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, i could not do it.
hi, rach.
i-i-i do not know if this falls under this category, but uh, ross is right back there.
(points over his shoulder.)
hey, you are not kip!
who cares?
you are rachel!
(to chandler) who is kip?
oh, that poor bastard.
hey, mr. bing.
that uh, hotel you stayed at called.
said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
because i figured you would hooked up with some girl and she would left it there.
y'know, i-i do not even feel like i know you anymore man!
all right, look, I am just going to ask you this one time.
and whatever you say, I will believe ya.
(pause.)
were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
(entering) (he clears his throat to get their attention.)
hey, rach?
sorry to interrupt but umm, phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
(shocked) oh!
ohh!
oh!!
oohh!!
ohh!
oh-oh-oh!
oh-oh!!
ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
(to chandler) you?!
(to monica) and-and you?!
how?!
when?!
in london!!!
but it is a big deal!!
i have to tell someone!
all right!
man, this is unbelievable!
i mean, it is great, but… aww, i do not want to see that!
i guess I am done.
i think I am going to take-off.
right!
and when is that due?
and that is every month?
ahhh.
(looking at it) oh my god!!
no-no!
no way!
joey tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
no!
forget it!
okay—i mean thanks, but I am done taking money from you.
all right, i can take of myself.
now, what is next?
come on.
this is how much we pay for electric?!!!
hey!
i do not know ross, not if you are going to talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
(quietly) I have got ben.
here it is!
our last pizzas together as roommates.
oh that is okay.
hey, actually in a way it is kind of nice.
me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
what, are you crazy?
you have not beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season.
it would be easier if you just give me your money.
okay, you are on.
(scores) yes!
i win again!
ha-ha!
that is like 500 bucks you owe me!
whoo-ho-hoo!
(goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.)
$500 that is a loooot of electricity!
(by the way, there is nothing in the fridge.)
whoo-ho-ho!
(notices the sparseness of the fridge.)
i got to buy some food.
you serious?
okay, get ready to owe me!
okay, here we go.
ready?
this sucks man!
the last night you are here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
nah, not my game.
well, what is it called?
i do not know how to play cups.
all right.
a two and a five.
really?!
a four and a nine.
no.
why?
damn!
i am good at cups!
well, what did you have?
uh, (counts the money) wow, 700. yeah.
what?
really?
hey!
ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in cups!
the same way you lost.
i started out with a king and a queen, bamn!
ross gets a 2 and a 3. then i get a jack and a king, boom!
ross gets a 4 and a 5!
ross was getting the cup card, the d-cup, the sittin’ down bonus!
meanwhile, i did not even get half a cup!
nothing!!
and he never played before either!
y’know what i think?
i think beginner’s luck, very important in cups.
no, no, no more!
i cannot lose another dime!
I am serious this time!
in-in fact, look, there is a—i want to give you something.
and let me give it too you know before i pawn it for cups money.
(he rolls the big white dog over) now, i want you to have the big white dog as a kind of of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
it is him, not it!
wait a second, i see what you are trying to do here!
you-you are trying to give me money again!
over there!
(points to the couch) before, with the bills!
you tried to give some charity, i said "no," you dropped it.
okay?
then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money!
now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
i will be okay!
look chandler, you got to get it out of your head that i can not take care of myself.
okay?
look, I am not going to miss you helping me out with money.
the only thing that I am going to miss…is you.
and now the dog.
ooh... i can not believe I am kissing you.
I am kissing rachel!
well, i only said that because of ross, you know.
then i saw him kissing charlie... oh my god, it is ross.
what are we going to do?
no idea what it means.
i do not believe this... have you guys been... is he gone?
pssst... well, he is with charlie now.
(long pause and he twitches a bit) you are a pain in my ass, geller!
probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to ross.
yeah, i think that would be best... so, so I am going to...
I am going to take off... (turns around very fast) i like although!
six years?
wow... it is almost as long as highschool... absolutely!
he is not thinking about you.
I am thinking about you... let us forget about ross... what is wrong?
well, maybe i can help.
(he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... ross in rachel's dress!
he realises it too late, and when he does, pushes ross's/rachel's head away) yeah... we really need to talk to ross... whoo, whoo.
wow, it is uhm... kind of weird that I am sitting next to charlie after we broke up.
look, does someone mind switching to sit with charlie?
i understand... i guess so.
I am just... really nervous.
ooh...
I am going to get the lasagna.
hey!
yeah?
you kissed.
i saw you.
ross, ross, ross... it is okay.
it is okay.
you know, i totally understand, alright?
you guys, make way more sense than her and i ever did, you know.
and... i want you to be happy.
yeah... now i have something... oh... uh... look... before you... i am those things, yeah.
dude!
i can not think of anything.
yeah.
i could not.
he was saying all these really nice things about me.
i did not want him to get mad and take  them all back.
I am on a edge on chandler.
thank you.
yeah, i appreciate that.
hey!
so, did you err... did you tell ross?
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think it is better if you tell him, you know.
it is easier for a woman.
that way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... i did not mean it.
I am so so--ooory.
(he pushes his breasts together from the side) alright, alright, okay, uhm... how 'bout this, how about this?
tomorrow... tomorrow we will both go and we will tell him together.
i know, i know..., but that is okay.
i mean, we can control ourselves, we are not animals.
yeah!
good night!
(they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while) good night!
(they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer) stop saying good night.
suck-fest.
hey, i do not need violence to enjoy a movie.
just so long as there is a little nudity.
i meant female nudity.
alright?
i do not need to see lou grant frolicking.
i agree.
I am, like, in disbelief.
she really said that?
'tonight' tonight?
how could you lose him?
alright alright.
you are a monkey.
you are loose in the city.
where do you go?
marcel?
marcel?
a monkey.
um, sure!
did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
oh.
then, no.
uh, are not we kind of in the middle of something here?
we can not, alright?
(to the women) we are sorry.
you have no idea how sorry, but... we promised we would find this monkey.
if you see him, he is about yea high and answers to the name marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you would really be helping us out.
marcel?
i dunno, i loved high school.
y'know?
it was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
hey!
you made it!
you are ready to have a baby?
my boy’s all grown up!
(voice all high and weird) what?!
are you crazy?!
god.
he is crazy!
why does not he want to be with rachel?
i mean seriously, she is like the perfect woman.
i mean i know she turned me down, but if she had not and wanted to be with me, i would take her in my arms and… (realizes everyone is staring.)
i have not bummed you guys out like this in a while have i?
come on you stupid machine!
come on!
(looking at her) no.
all right.
hey i got one!
i got one!
(standing behind her) uh, you got to press the button.
(does so.)
(walks up) uh, she is with me.
(introduces himself) dr. drake remoray.
remoray.
it is portuguese.
we need that information; I am a doctor.
damnit woman we are losing precious time!
now do you want this man’s blood on your head?
hands!
it is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
he is a patient of mine, I have been treating him for years!
816, thank you!
and what is his name?
great!
go get him.
(looks in the window) he is not really my type.
but you said he was this great guy!
you do attract some stinkers.
hi!
I am dr. drake remoray and i have a few routine questions i need to ask you.
i know, but I am a neurologist.
and just to be on the safe side, dr. wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
that was a test.
good response.
all right, full name.
date of birth?
age?
I am a doctor cliff, not a mathematician.
okay.
and uh, are you married.
oh really?
so, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
(checking the list) yes.
oh that is terrible.
I am-I am really sorry.
hmm.
do you sleep with women and never call them again?
excellent!
excellent!
and uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?
oooh, wrong answer.
(exits.)
uh, well he is 33. a widower.
he seemed like a stand up guy.
oh, and he is not into anything weird sexually.
(entering) rachel’s having her baby!!
(phoebe turns and looks at him.)
which is of no interest to me, I am a neurologist.
fake?
excuse me?
hello?
(taps the tv screen.)
uh, if i may?
umm-umm look, cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
and maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her.
uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer.
uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets.
oh!
oh!
her-her twin sister used to do porn!
right!
me neither.
there she is!
(taking the baby) she looks so real!
(the gang looks at him.)
y’know what i mean!
she is this whole tiny little person.
she already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.
oh no-no, no for i second there i counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we are good.
what is the matter now?
what was the other one ross?
hey.
i just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.
(notices she is wiping her eyes.)
what is the matter?
what is it?
hey!
rach come on, what?
what are you talking about alone?
what about ross?
okay, how long was i watching that woman?
yeah, i guess so.
hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever going to be alone.
okay?
i promise that is not going to happen.
you do not have to worry about that okay?
sure.
my god.
hey!
well, hey!
well... (he takes his mug to toast phoebe) here is to phoebe, who is found the greatest guy in the world!
to phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) i want to say mike?
(pause) to phoebe and mike!
(looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back.
then he closes the door, and we see it is joey.)
hi sweetie!
no.
cool!
that is great!
hey, can you cast me in it?
what do you mean?
i can do anything, I am a chameleon!
huh?
(he mimes an old man with a beard) I am old!
(then he yawns) I am tired!
(then he mimes someone who is hot...) hey, I am hot (...and cold) I am cold!!
huh??
come on!
what can not i do?
i can do that!
(in a deeper voice) "hello, I am your professor.
when I am not busy thinking of important things or... professing.
i like to use..." oh, what is the product?
(after a long pause he starts miming again) I am cold!
oh!
any word on casting yet?
what do you mean?
rach, do not i seem like a professor you would buy some kind of e-crap from?
just watch it, and if you do not like it, you do not pass it on to your bosses!
thank you.
(he sits down) damn it!
(he leaves) just pass it to your boss!
what is up?
(sounds disappointed) oh.
(looks at him suspiciously) but, ehm... you watched the tape?
(sounds confident) you did not watch the tape.
look, it is one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
well, you lied again!
(rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation) keep going pinocchio!
(yelling back) no you did not!
(turns and goes towards his room) you still here?
ok whoah-hey... let me just stop you right there, ok?
first, you lied, right?
then, you lied about lying, ok?
then you lied about lying about lying, ok?
so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.)
(yelling) stop lying!
(very angry) you want to know wh...?
you want to know why?
(goes back into his room) (comes out holding the tape) here is how i know you did not watch the tape, ok?
(puts it into the vcr) if you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments.
alright, now remember, i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan.
(presses play and he appears on the tv screen and a tv commercial begins) (yelling at chandler) and that is how i know you did not watch the tape!
(goes back to his room and slams the door).
(enters from his bedroom) what?
i got it from monica.
she sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
but it is an original buffay... hey?
what?
what?
wey!
whoo!
what?
what!?
get that legless witch out of here!
that is not the point chandler.
the point is that you lied.
now, what do you say?
and?...
and?
gladys?
you are mean!
question.
was ah, ‘egg the gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?
booo!!
(entering) hey, you guys!
guess what?
i got a gig!
well, it is not a part, no.
I am teaching acting for soap operas down at the learning extension.
yeah, yeah.
it is like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
(glares at him) i know!
good evening.
I am mr. tribbiani.
and i will be teaching acting for soap operas.
now um, on my first day as (proudly) dr. drake remoray on days of our lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.)
i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you do not have a line, but someone else just did.
and it goes like this.
(looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) thanks, thanks, a lot.
oh, by the way, before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive.
all right, moving right along.
hi!
oh it was great.
yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’hey, the bell does not dismiss you, i dismiss you.’ oh, and guess what, i got an audition for all my children.
yeah, it is this great part, this boxer named nick.
and I am so, so right for it, y'know, he is just like me.
except he is a boxer, and has an evil twin.
hey, monica bought a bed from the mattress king?
you want me to lie to chandler?
no.
hey, you are ah, pretty good at this.
ahh!
hey now!
hey!!!
oww!!
and I am bleeding.
okay, great.
okay.
all right.
i can not see.
okay, some tricks of the trade.
now, I have never been able to cry as an actor, so if I am in a scene where i have to cry, i cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling.
or ah, or, let us say i want to convey that I have just done something evil.
that would be the basic ‘i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it’ (does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.)
okay, let us say I have just gotten bad news, well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
(looks all confused) and that is how it is done.
great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
hey-hey.
awww, one of my students got an audition.
I am so proud.
you bet!
what is the part?
wow!
that was good.
that was...(points to his pocket) tweezers?
whoa.
that was really good.
well, i-i might have said supergay.
because, monica, the guy’s so good, and i really, really want this part.
(sadly) there will come a time in each of your careers when you will have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
i had such an opportunity in the recent, present.
and I am ashamed to say that i took it, i advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually.
yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.
and now, he is got a two year contract opposite susan luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I am stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv.
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.
(he gets a huge round of applause from his students.)
thank you.
all right, jester man, look we want to see the king.
oh-ho-kay, I am talking to the king.
(starts to go to a back room) (answering phone) hello.
(answering phone) hello.
(answering phone) stop callin’!!
all right!
hey!
I am sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt.
no!
I am putting that in my room.
back when you and rachel were together, if chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
five years.
hey!
do not do the crime if you can not do the time.
no, was my best friend.
anyway, i do not know why you are pushing for him so hard.
with him out of the way as my best friend, there is a spot open.
yeah!
what?
all right.
but if you were not my best friend.
(entering) hey gunther, have you uh, have you seen chandler?
(something in italian.)
(storms out.)
my folks.
i do not know.
i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment.
yeah, y’know at first i thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together i do not think i… look, it is not about her.
okay?
but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did.
and i do not want to live with some one who does not know what it is to be a friend.
so, I will see ya.
(he starts to leave, but chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)
yeah!
you did!
and that is why I am leaving.
when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what i was doing in there all that time?
i was thinking about how i let you down!
yeah!
but if would have know what kind of friend you were going to turn out to be, i would not have worried about it so much!
see you around!
we have got a box.
(motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
(coming out of the bathroom) what is twisted?
ewwwww!!
ew!
ew!
ew!
he is fine!
chandler?
hey!
he is doing some thinkin’!
you kissed my girlfriend!
that does not sound like thinking to me!
y’know i do not think you should be talking at all in there!
i think you have got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
all right, look!
if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?!
this means something to me!
and if it does not mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you are just an idiot in a box!
so are you going to start taking this thing seriously?
that sounds like another word to me!
are you going to take this seriously?
(there is no response from chandler.)
okay.
I will get it.
(it is kathy.)
hey.
that is okay.
chandler’s the one I am mad at.
in the box.
(starting to cry) open the box!!
(runs over to do so.)
he can still catch her!
come on, get out of there!
(he opens the box) get out of there!
yeah, we are going to be fine!
get out!
yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.
now go!
‘because you can still catch her!
and merry christmas from you are secret santa!
(chandler runs out and closes the door.)
all right, who got chandler?
‘because i uh, need to trade.
uhh, that is not them.
I am going to go call the police.
