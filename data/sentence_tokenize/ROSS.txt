(joey gives him a ‘like i would know’ look) wow!
that aspirin dance really works!
oh my god, is that still... no you are not.
rach!
(stopping her from falling) okay, okay.
look, you have got to go to a doctor!
okay?
and I am sure you are going to make a big impression.
hi!
I am rachel green.
it is nice to meet you.
(he lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands with it, just like how rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.)
come on, you probably have a broken rib!
rach... rachel... fine.
I will go.
(he checks his watch) sure.
I will help you.
ohh.
(he drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip.
he does not like how it tastes.)
okay.
this stuff?
all right.
oke-dokey.
(he pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
sorry.
sorry, I am sorry.
close, close, close...
I am sweeping... sweep, sweep....(he starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she has a black eye.)
what?
what?
no.
no, y'know you do not, you do not wear enough of this.
(rachel is shocked) what?
well i, close your eyes, i just think you are going to like this a little better, ‘because, close-close... (he gets some more on the brush) (blows it) sorry.
‘because umm, i think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
there you go!
good enough for your party, huh?
yep?
okay, come on!
all right, i got to go!
so good luck at the party.
okay?
(checks his watch) sure, okay.
what?
rachel, I have seen you naked a million times.
i ate hot fudge off you naked.
remember, i-i sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
rach, y'know i can see you naked any time i want.
all i have to do is close my eyes.
see?
(closes his eyes) woo-hoo!!
ah, I am sorry.
ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it.
it is one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend.
(closes his eyes again) oop, oh yeah!
okay, okay, I am sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) uh-oh!
wait a minute!
wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I am the king.
come on, would you grow up?
it is no big deal.
yowzah!!!
aww, come on.
oh my god!
all right.
look... okay.
rach?
easy.
easy.
you have to go to the hospital.
okay?
okay.
okay, I am going to get your coat and then I will-I will put you in a cab.
(he thinks about it) of course i am.
i just have to make a call.
okay?
(goes into the living room) (rushing back in) what?!
i wh-, what is wrong?
rach, you can not look fat in an x-ray.
(to chandler) that is a duck.
oh, it was, nah, well.... nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum.
come on.
(they go into her apartment) easy.
i was kind of, supposed to be on tv tonight for the discovery channel.
yeah.
eh, ‘because i knew that if i told you, you would make me go, and i knew you needed someone to be with you tonight.
come on.
come on.
what?
(breaking the silence) you should get some sleep.
so, I will umm... no, that is, no, as long as you are okay.
so I will ah, I will see you tomorrow.
that is right, i love you!
and-and I am going to play with you all the time.
bye.
yeah.
why?
yeah i know; he is in ben’s class.
fine!
no more dinosaur stuff!
can i talk about fossils?
(joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
what are you reading?
the kidnappers guide to manhattan private schools?
uh, i actually have not even met him.
well actually, I am picking ben up tomorrow, maybe he will be there.
(entering) hey!
hey i uh just picked up ben from school… i dropped him off at carol’s.
(to phoebe) anyway, it turns out that I am not going to be able to get those tickets though.
well it turns out that ben and sting’s son do not get along.
apparently, sting’s son made fun of the fact that ben’s moms are lesbinims.
phoebe, you can not force kids to be friends.
playpen?!
ben’s seven!
look I am sorry pheebs, i can not do it.
what?
look phoebe, I am sorry it is just… phoebe, i… you are going to love me so much.
i got sting tickets!!
(holds up two.)
well…let us just say… (singing) rosss caaaaan!
uh, middle balcony.
yeah.
about what?
well, you-you have always had glasses.
are you sure?
(entering from the bathrooms) hey chandler, what are you doing tonight?
no, why?
my dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
yeah and he did not really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you.
no, i-i thought it would be more fun this way.
or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans.
he does that every week too.
yeah.
you are not a lefty?
oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
no one got me an engagement present.
two!
I have been engaged twice!
(entering with chandler) hey.
well i had a great time!
umm, chancy on the other hand… and what did he ask you not to call him?
over here.
(you can see ross sitting at the far wall.)
‘because otherwise they would have to call it the room room.
now, i know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
oh, but he will.
he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp.
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
you were trying to eat it!
whoa-whoa, are not you a little over dressed?
(to rachel) hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present?
thank you!
hey.
yeeeeeep… yep-yep-yep-yep-yep.
i remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she would not let me help at all.
you have to respect the sea!
(storms off.)
let us give it a shot.
ohh, these are pretty good.
which one was that?
oh yeah!
batch 17 was good.
i did not like batch 16.
(burps a little bit.)
I am okay.
yeah, ooh yeah, i think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and does not like it.)
it is batch 16!
16 people!
get out of the way!
(gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
looking up?
aww, pheeb, come on is not there any relative that would have the recipe?
what about, what about your sister?
that is the day you are going to die?
see—darnit, I have got shuffleboard that day.
(entering) hey!
no why?
oh well, i guess I will catch up with her later.
oh no.
i think i might know what this is about.
yeah.
uh, uh we promised we were not going to tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago rachel and i slept together.
wow!
i thought you would be a little more shocked.
well, we-we said we would just do it that one time but, but now i think she may want to start things up again.
why?
what-what else could it be?
I am telling you.
I am telling you.
that is what it is.
no wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.
she did not say anything to you?
yeah, i guess i should.
(starts to leave.)
man, y’know what i have to realize?
maybe I am just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more.
i should remember that.
(he pauses and then exits.)
hi.
(quietly confident) i think we do.
why do not we go inside?
(they go inside.)
look uh, i know why you are here.
yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, i think maybe i should talk first.
okay.
(he sits her down in a chair.)
uh, ross and rachel.
rachel and ross.
that is been one heck of a see-saw has not it?
i mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but do not you think it is better if we just stayed friends?
okay.
okay.
y’know what?
if you want to, we can do it one more time.
i mean I would-I would be okay with that.
in fact, i have some time right now.
oh sure.
(he sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
I am good.
I am good.
yeah, i need uh… I am just—i do not know—i do not understand, umm, how this happened?
we-we used a condom.
what?
what?
what?!!
well they should put that on the box!!!
no they do not!!!
(he runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.)
well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
oh well i may as well have!
freaked out?
hey no, I am not freaked out!
I am indignant!
as a consumer!
no!
no!
i want to talk now!
okay?
i—in fact, (picks up the phone) i am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
(grabs her) shh!
shh!
shh!
(on phone) yeah I will press 1!
(presses one which allows rachel to escape.)
hi.
sure.
namaste.
(bows.)
oh my god!
what happened to the door?!
look, is rachel here?
i really need to talk to her.
yeah but uh… okay, okay look you guys know that rachel and i slept together, but there is something else.
(pause) rachel’s pregnant.
with my child.
you already know do not you?
okay.
okay.
i mean I will be okay.
it is just i do not think i handled it very well.
nothing.
but the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
and then when i turned around she was gone.
but hey, in my defense i-i just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
i got to go find her.
evidently they do.
hi!
uh we-we need to talk.
please, please i want to apologize for the way i acted earlier today.
what?
oh yeah.
(he moves next to her head.)
I am sorry.
i mean i-i think i went a little crazy.
i mean i was thinking about myself when i (wanders towards rachel’s feet) really—i should have been thinking about you rach… right!
right!
i just—i want you to know that I am going to be there through this whole thing, okay?
okay?
the doctor’s appointments, the uh, the lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
well yeah, i think we should get married.
no, because that is the right thing to do.
no but…but still you can not possibly do this alone.
come on rach, you can not even eat alone in a restaurant.
I am just saying if you can not eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
when have you ever?
well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
i grew up with monica!
if you did not eat fast you did not eat!!
but not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
(to rachel, standing by her feet) i do not know why you can not admit that you need me.
oh my god.
thank you.
pretty amazing huh?
what?
what?!
you-you just said that you did!
oh sure, come here!
(sits her up) sure you can!
uh, look come here look, (rolls the machine closer) it is-it is-it is, it is right there (points).
do you really?
come on!
come on!
here, okay-okay, you see this?
(points) this tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
sweetie that is it.
you are welcome.
yeah, that is our baby.
oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
oh.
(he takes the picture and hugs her.
(entering) hey!
(thinking it over) sure!
(takes one) hey, i just found out, i get ben for the holidays this year.
nope.
i mean, i know susan does every year, but i think i want to take this year to teach him all about hanukkah.
hmm.
wooooooo, hehehe.
hey, ahh, you do not feel like you are going to throw up, do ya?
well, i do, so let us... (ben and ross sit down on the couch) so, ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, do not ya?
yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
yes, but also (pauses to let ben answer, but he does not.)
hanukkah!
see, you are part jewish, and-and hanukkah is a jewish holiday.
right, um, but, on hanukkah, hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle.
see, years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees.
(interrupts him) okay, that is right, yes, but on hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh (sings) dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, i made you out of clay.
(interrupts him again) okay, it is not a contest.
well, how about this year, instead of santa, we have fun celebrating hanukkah?
no!
oh, no-no-no.
hey, you were not bad, you have been very good, ben.
no, hey-hey, come on, (he grabs ben and sits him on his lap) ben, santa is not mad at you, okay?
hey, you are-you are his favorite little guy!
(disappointed) yes!
santa's coming!
hey!
no, these are my pants.
well, uh, do you have a santa-outfit left?
okay look, do-do, you have anything christmassy?
i promised my son, and i really do not want to disappoint him, um, come on, i…uh, you got to have something.
I am the holiday armadillo!
I am a friend of santa's and he sent me here to wish you (points to ben) a merry christmas!
(to monica) santa was unavailable so close to christmas.
that is right, ben.
I am santa's representative for all the southern states.
and mexico!
but, santa sent me here to give you these presents, ben.
(he tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can not because of the costume) maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
you are welcome, ben.
merry christmas, ooh, and happy hanukkah!
(gasps) you are?
me, too!
(to monica) you want to wander in the hall?
(to ben) ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
yeah!
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees... what are you doing here, santa?
I am the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend.
you sent me here to give ben some presents.
remember?
(to chandler) what are you doing?
thank you, but, but you got to leave.
because, I am finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you are-you are wrecking it.
I am sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me.
okay ben, santa has to go.
say good-bye!
fine, i-i give up.
santa, santa can stay.
all right, it is time for the story of hanukkah.
years and years ago, there were these people called the maccabees.
…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should have just lasted just one day, burned for… that is right, and that is why we celebrate hanukkah today.
the end.
yeah?
the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part!
okay ben, it is time to light the hanukkah candles!
(santa, superman, monica, ben, and the holiday armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
come on, come on, we are-we are-we are lighting the candles!
so, uh, what kind of stuff do you think they will have you do there?
you know, if i did not already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising.
yes, i did, i did!
(he turns to joey, disappointed) i should have written it down!
oh, i can not.
I have got a date with that waitress, katy, yeah, i know we have been only going out like twice, but i have a really good feeling about her.
(taken aback) what?
of-ok. just relax, phoene, just stay calm.
(he searches his coat and freaks out).
oh my god, i can not find my wallet.
(still in a high-pitched voice) what do you mean "no"?
i knew you would be my death, phoebe buffay.
yeah, a real pleasure.
(shocked) oh my god.
phoebe, you used to mug people?
hey, you will never guess what just happened… phoebe and i got mugged!
(sitting down) yah, because phoebe knew the mugger!
you want to know how she knew him?
(he points at phoebe) because phoebe used to mug people.
well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because (menacingly) i was about to do some serious damage!
yeah, it was pretty traumatic.
i was outside st. marc's comics… you know, i-i-i was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kind of trouble spiderman got into that week- anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone… (he looks at monica) … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "give me your money, punk!"
i know!
and-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book: "science boy" a superhuman thirst for knowledge.
well, i-i better get to class (he stands up) are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way, phoebe?
hey!
no one ever asked me that, what is wrong?
oh… (he looks positively surprised) well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene… (disbelieving) wh-what are you talking about?
it was not a girl.
it was this huge dude.
no, it was not.
no, it was not.
you do not think i would have defended myself against a fourteen year-old… (shocked) oh my god, it was you!
i can not believe it, you… you mugged me?
it is not the best!
(indignant) there is nothing you can say.
that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
(interrupting) hey, let us not do this!
sure, go ahead.
whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
(he raises his hands as if being mugged) (faking enthusiasm) oh my god, crap from the street?
(she smiles excitedly, but ross just turns back to his newspaper) oh my god.
(he sighs) i never thought I would see this again.
(he browses trough the pages) it is all here.
what made you save it all these years?
you really thought "science boy" was worth saving!
still… this is amazing… oh my god, thank you, phoebe.
you are welcome.
(entering) hey, uhm, phoebe did not by any chance mention that… i see.
you did not happen to tell… great.
thanks!
(he leaves) (hopping) 73!
72!
71!
what?
well, who is going to kiss my sister.
awww, man!
really?
that is a good point.
oh well, since i have that whole history with rachel, i guess phoebe.
all right.
well, everyone is got to kiss someone.
you can not kiss ross you got the history.
(to phoebe) happy new year, pheebs!
y'know what?
I am going to go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
just the one divorce in '99!
y'know what, i am going to be happy this year.
i am going to make myself happy.
everyday i am going to do one thing that i have not done before.
that my friends is my new year's resolution.
in fact, I will bet you 50 bucks that you can not go the whole year without making fun of us.
eh, y'know what, better yet?
a week.
ohh.
okay!
(she leaves.)
(to chandler and joey.)
hey!
i just asked that girl out.
yes it is.
see.
(shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)
that is right, uh, elizabeth hornswoggle.
hi, pheebs!
oh-oh, guess what?
i-i have a date with elizabeth (talking into chandler's ear.)
hornswoggle.
all right, see you later.
(entering, with ben) hi!
oh see, i-i needed a new thing for today and there is this leather store that always smells so good and i thought to myself, "wow, (to chandler) i never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
(after he is left) okay, seriously, what do you think?
what are you, what are you doing?
what, to blind my child?
(talking to himself) my god!
these pants are burning up!
(he is still wearing the leather pants.)
(she snuggles closer.)
oh come on, she wants to snuggle now!
what is she trying to kill me?
it is like a volcano in here!
(out loud.)
are you hot?
okay, it must just be me then.
that was just the pants on the couch.
umm, hey, do you, do you mind if i use your bathroom?
thanks.
(gets up and as he does so, the sound returns.
without another word he heads into her bathroom.)
(in ecstasy) ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….
'kay!
oh my god!
(calling from elizabeth's bathroom) joey, it is ross!
i need some help!
well, you can help me!
listen, I am in elizabeth's bathroom… no, i-i got really hot in my leather pants so i took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat.
look, i-i can not put them back on.
i can not!
powder!
yeah!
yeah, i have powder!
(grabs some of her shelf.)
yeah, okay, hold on!
(he puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants.
it does not work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.)
(almost in tears.)
they are not coming on man.
ohh, i-i see lotion, i have lotion!
will that work?
hold on.
they are still, they are still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
what difference does that make?!
dude, what am i going to… all right, I am coming out.
hey, can you turn the lights off.
i had a problem.
this year was supposed to be great!
but, it is only the second day and I am a loser with stupid leather pants that do not even fit!
look at me!
(chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
oh, be-because of the leather pants.
maybe i should get another pair!
ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
(chandler starts rubbing his temple again.)
I am going to go kiss ben goodnight.
(he starts to head for monica's bedroom.)
i can not believe he thinks I am a cowboy.
(pause.)
i would make a good cowboy.
(he struts into monica's room.)
(entering) hey guys!
oh no, not yet.
oh.
thanks.
uh, has anyone seen rach?
yeah—oh!
hey listen umm, emily found this wedding dress in london… yeah, but it did not fit.
well, luckily there is a store here that has one left in her size, but I am the groom, I am not supposed to see the dress… thank you.
what is wah-pah?
hey!
hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
so listen uh, i know you and i have not really had a chance to talk since uh, emily and i decided to get married, and uh, i was just wondering how you were.
i know if you were getting married I would feel, kind of….. y’know.
yeah?
all right, i just wanted to check.
you are great.
and i-i know someday this will happen for you too.
you just hang in there.
oh, no, i did not mean, uh… oh, i thought you guys had just been on like four dates, i did not realise that had become anything, yet.
oh.
yeah?
wow, that is-that is-that is incredible.
uh-huh.
i got to get to work.
hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?
if like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together.
uh, in fact emily’s coming into town this weekend, why do not you say we all have dinner?
say, sunday night?
yeah, all right, it is a date.
(he leaves) (coming back in) did you say something?
hey man.
so, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
great!
because emily and i are getting married in a month!
yep!
yeah!
yeah.
yeah.
yeah!
yeah, emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it is going to be torn down, so… i mean, i-i know it is crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and i do not know, this just feels right.
y’know?
(entering) hey!
so, i got us some reservations for sunday night, okay?
how about, ernie’s at 9 of the clock?
oh, see i-i do not know if we are going to be hungry at three.
what happened?
noo.
why?
oh, rachel, I am-I am sorry.
come here.
yeah.
you okay?
(surprised) hi!
awww.
yeah.
(closes the door, and goes over and kisses rachel.)
i know.
(stopping suddenly and getting up) okay, i got to go.
well, i-i got to go break up with bonnie.
well, yeah.
i can not-i can not stay here all night, and if i go in there she is-she is going to want to... do stuff.
no, she likes that.
yeah.
faking sleep does not work either, i can not tell you how many mornings i woke up with her... whoa-oh, okay!
yeah, why am i telling you that?
yeah, yeah.
(opens the door) it was not every morning.
okay.
it is over.
well, it was loong.
i did not even realise how late it was, until i noticed the 5 of the clock shadow on her head.
(they both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.)
anyway, she did not want to stay.
i called a cab; she just left.
ohh!
thank you!
i like mail.
(he goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)
okay.
(he leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.)
wow, it is-it is 5:30 in the morning.
(rachel laughs) so, I would better get cracking on this baby.
okay, I will be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages.
front and back.
very exciting.
oh.
(looks at his watch) oh-oh.
(takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter) done!
well, i wanted to be thorough.
i mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
and so i wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
I am sorry.
does it?
does it?
yeah, i wanted to give that whole ‘does it?’ part just another glance.
(interrupting) no, rach, no.
i do not, i do not, i do not have to think about it, in fact, I have decided, I have decided that, that it.......does.
oh, sure!
I am sure.
hey!
what happened?
it does.
it really and truly does.
(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) it so does not!!!
she wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship.
i mean she goes on for five pages about, about how i was unfaithful to her!
(both joey and chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”well...”) (yelling) we were on a break!!!!!
fine!
fine!
but this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “if you accept full responsibility...” (to chandler and joey) full responsibility!
“...i can begin to trust you again.
does that seem like something you can do.
(yells at joey) does it?!
!” (calming down) yeah, i know.
i mean, no, you are right.
yeah i guess I will let it go.
but you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
what the hell happened on that beach?!
(coming back in with rachel) hey, you guys!
what do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
what happened?
joey?
wait a minute!
i saw that!
on the discovery channel, yeah!
about jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at monica) ewwww!!
you peed on yourself?!
i missed you too.
(getting miffed) i suppose.
(getting angry) umm-hmm.
(yelling from the bedroom) we were on a break!!!!!!!
and for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
i did not know what i was taking full responsibility for!
okay?!
i did not finish the whole letter!
i fell asleep!
it was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages.
front and back!!
(they go into the living room, trapping monica, chandler, and joey in the kitchen) (to rachel) oh-oh-oh, and by the way, y-of-you-apostrophe-r-e means ‘you are,’ y-of-you-r means ‘your!’ (starts to cry) fine by me!!
(he opens the door and traps chandler behind it) oh, no-no-no do not you worry about me falling asleep.
i still have your letter!!!
well, they are not mine!
why are they here?
(entering, depressed) hi.
someone at work ate my sandwich!
my thanksgiving leftover sandwich.
i can not believe someone ate it!
just a sandwich?
look, i am 30 years old, I am about to be divorced twice and i just got evicted!
that sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life!
someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
(quietly) that-that would be incredible.
thank you so much.
i-i still can not believe someone ate it!!
i mean, look, i left a note and everything.
really?!
so what would you say pheebs?
stuff like uh, "keep your mitts off my grub?"
(entering) phoebe!
phoebe!
you are note, amazing!
not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me.
yeah, a guy called me mental!
mental geller, yeah, i always wanted a cool nickname like that.
that was the water fountain!
okay?!
anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I am telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.
(joey walks by with a cup of coffee.)
hey tribbiani, give me that coffee!
now!
yeah, of course, donald.
what?!
(proudly) yeah.
oh no, you-you do not understand.
ugh, this is so silly.
umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
yeah.
you see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.
her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; i call it the moist maker.
anyway, i-i put my sandwich in the fridge over here… what?
you ate my sandwich?
(getting upset) oh-oh really?
did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker?
do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
(getting angry) that said it was my sandwich?!
(jumping to his feet in anger) what?
you-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
(losing control, we hear him shout outside) my sandwich?!!!
my sandwich!!!!!!
(ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
(in a stupor) hey chandler.
(sees monica.)
monica!
I am fine!
i saw a psychiatrist at work today.
on account of my rage.
he gave me a pill for it.
uh-huh.
well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer.
and i thought was a good idea so, i took it.
i do not know.
it is going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely do not care about my sandwich.
(entering, with the rest of the gang) what is going on?
(covering his eyes) dude!
that is my sister!
(she shows the rest of the gang.)
yeah, what is going on?
you slept with my sister?
this is not good for my rage.
(takes another pill.)
my god monica!!
unbelievable!
i mean you really kept joey's underwear?!
why?
why would you do that?!
hey everybody!
hey uh, this is elizabeth.
oh no-no-no, we are just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house.
(he winks at her.)
bye.
oh that is quite all right madam.
(elizabeth exits.)
yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
anyone else?
huh?
bring ‘them on!
i do not know rachel, why?
well thanks!
well, actually it is been great.
she is 20 so she is not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
thanks.
i know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her.
just knowing that you guys are… hmm?
(turns around and sees that its elizabeth) oh, a student i do not know.
yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
shh!
(laughs then composes himself) of course, why do not we go inside?
oh-ooh!
doorknob!
doorknob!
oh, okay.
what-what about?
spring vacation.
(quickly jumping away from elizabeth) yes, professor feesen-sen-stenlger… I will be with you in one moment.
(to elizabeth) so, i will take one box of the thin mints.
(and he ushers elizabeth out of the office.)
you do not understand!
elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her!
is that taking it slow?!
no, I am not ready for this!
okay?
what-what do i tell her?
i can do that.
oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
what the hell are you doing?
what?!
what?
how do you, how do you even know its broken?!
joey, i did not break this!
okay?
(he opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.)
that has been broken for a while.
do not give him any money!
yes.
yes!
please, come in.
oo-oo!
yeah, it kind of grows on you.
(they both laugh.)
actually, i wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
look, i… (he has trouble sitting in his chair.)
look, I am having a great time with you and i just do not want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us.
so, I am sorry i just do not think we should go away together yet.
it is-it is too soon.
no.
i think you misunderstood what i was saying.
what i meant was… that!
let us talk about that.
hey!
huh?
oh-oh, it was fine.
uh, it was just a misunderstanding.
she did not want me to go with her.
she just wanted to let me know that she is going to florida for spring vacation.
what is-what is the difference?
hey, y’know what?
not all spring breaks are like that.
i went to egypt with my dad.
hey, i think elizabeth is a little more serious than, "spring break!"
(imitates the party noise.)
all right?
i mean she is taken my class!
I am going to call her.
well, it turns out that she is going to daytona for spring break woo-hoo.
that means, that means wet t-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you do not even know… okay, she can not go.
then what am i supposed to do?
well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
I am so glad you are going on this trip!
sure.
sure.
look i do not, i do not know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey i-i know another great way to blow off steam.
are you into crafts at all?
well, yeah, of-of course I am okay!
what?
I am just being supportive.
supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, what is this?
(he holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
to wear in front of people?
is this?!
so uh, have a great time down there.
yeah.
and did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
it was pretty funny when i, when i hid it for a while, huh?
anyway, umm, i-i am worried about that bathing suit, not because it is revealing which I am fine with, no I am concerned about your health, sun exposure.
well, if what is in the bottle is actually 30. i mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it is-it is get 4, and i swear to god more often than not it is just milk.
really?
okay.
cool.
call me!
she is not here yet.
she is not here.
she is having my baby and she is not here.
i do not know, but when i spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
god, i do not believe this.
she could be giving birth in the cab.
she is not even here yet.
(to carol) where the hell have you been?
susan wanted a chunky.
we are having a baby, ok, a baby, you do not stop for chunkys.
stopped for a chunky.
(weakly) no.
dr. franzblau, hi.
59 seconds.
(holds up his watch) quartz, ha.
I will get it.
i got it—I am getting it!
yeah.
I am paying you to stop.
breathe.
breathe.
breathe.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12... who the hell is jordie?
no-no-no.
i do not have a son named jordie.
we all agreed, my son's name is jamie.
what?
whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to jordie?
we never landed on jordie.
we just passed by it during the whole jessy, cody, dylan fiasco.
i got it.
i got it!
hey, you get to sleep with her, i get the cramps.
why?
no, you started it.
but... (to susan) thanks a lot.
(to carol) yeah, listen... please.
this is so your fault.
look, carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
you tryin' to be clever?
a funny lady?
oh, I am threatened by you?
yeah, susan.
I am having a baby in here!
ok, everyone stand back.
(walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) ow.
help!
help!
come on, come on.
damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.
(to susan) this is all your fault.
this is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?
my son is being born, and i should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
no no no, believe me.
no one has been waiting for this as much as i have, ok?
and you know what the funny thing is?
when this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?
where does that leave me?
every day is lesbian lover day.
you want to explain that?
ok, got the vent open.
ben, you ready?
all right, give me your foot.
ok, on three, ben.
one, two, three.
ok, that is it, ben.
phoebs, it is open!
it is open!
we are here!
long story, honey.
let me see, i got to see, i got to see.
oh, a head.
oh, it is, it is huge.
carol, how are you doing this?
(puts his head near the baby) hello!
(to dr. franzblau) oh, sorry.
we got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach.
it is a boy, definitely a boy!
all right!
ok, legs, knees, and feet.
oh, oh.
he is here.
he is a person.
kind of like my uncle ed, covered in jell-of.
oh, thanks, pheebs!
(thinking) how 'bout ben?
we uh, we just cooked it up.
hey.
(to ben) i know, i know.
everybody, there is someone I would like you to meet.
yeah.
this is ben.
ben, this is everybody.
the head, the head.
you got to... ben, i want you to know that there may be some times when i may not be around, like this.
(walks out of the picture) but I will still always come back, like this.
(returns) and sometimes i may be away longer, like this.
(walks away) but I will still always come back, like this.
(returns) no, this is pretty much it.
all right, I will see you guys later.
hi.
hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
uh, before we do uh, are any of joey’s special romance magazines in there?
(to ben) okay!
all clear!
(to ben) everything okay in there?
hey listen can you do me a big favor?
the dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting.
can you watch ben for like an hour?
oh, she is not home.
well, ben would be there.
what is the matter?
rach, he is not an ex-con.
i do not know!
just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
okay.
(ben enters) ben?
come here.
all right, I am going to leave you here with aunt rachel for about an hour.
okay?
are you going to be okay?
(to rachel) i was not talking to you.
okay, I will see you soon buddy.
(he hugs and kisses him.)
be back in an hour.
i have a bone to pick with you.
yes!
ben learned a little trick.
that is right!
that is right!
saran wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
yeah that!
you know i hate practical jokes!
they are mean and they are stupid and-and i do not want my son learning them!
i was barefoot.
now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
rachel!
what are you doing here?
your good friend?
what is her last name?
nice.
and by the way that uh, that line down my face?
wh-wh-what line?
the line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, (in a college frat boy voice) "dude, do not you ever was your face?"
of course i was mad!
i told you i-i hate this stuff!
okay?
it-it is not funny!
hi.
practical jokes.
you have a line down your face.
uh, y’know what?
I will tell you who it hurts!
it hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
i will be!
listen, i do not want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.
okay?
no that is not what i want.
uh, I am glad you guys were bonding but i… hey!
hey I am sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after ben for a little bit?
i-I have got this meeting at school.
and-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘fun aunt’ rachel, so… okay, I will see you later pal.
what?
what?
(she takes the sign off and hands it to him.)
that is great.
that is great.
(crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.)
what did we just finish talking about ben?!
all right, that is it!
(he runs over to ben, but he runs past him and out the door.)
come—you—no!
you are in big trouble young man!
wait!
no!
ben, come here!
i am not kidding!
i-i-am—(suddenly ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of rachel.)
oh, I am actually on my way to tell her right now.
yeah, she is been away all week visiting her parents, but she will be cool.
i mean, she is been so supportive.
she-she even got the baby a tiny t-shirt that says, ‘fossils are my friends.’ uh, I am going to take off.
what is it?
all right.
(reading the label) ‘candy and cookie?’ hey, what is behind your back?
you do not want my opinion?
come on, I am your older brother, ask me!
(quietly) the red one.
hey!
(they hug) so, how was atlantic city?
yeah?
wha—?
oh, come on.
you did not have to—saltwater taffy?!
(mona laughs) thanks!
this is interesting.
you know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it is actually made with, uh, salted fresh water.
that is not interesting.
i do too!
i missed you!
oh, it was good!
it was good.
actually, the baby started kicking!
yeah!
i know!
it was.
oh… the only sad thing is i was not around when it happened for the first time.
yeah, I am missing out on all this other stuff, too.
so, joey suggested rachel move in with me.
what?
(not amused) huh…uh-huh.
(with his mouth full) just a second!
(he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down) i do not know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea!
um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
ever?!
oh, no, no, no, i will!
i just want to butter her up, first!
you know, I am going to take her to an amazing valentine’s dinner.
do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I am the best boyfriend in the world, then I am going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
well, I am, uh, going to pick up mona.
what have you got going tonight?
y’know, it is interesting!
most people think that is made with seawater, when in fact— (opening the door to see mona standing there) mona?
what are—hi!
what are you doing here?
I am, um, supposed to pick you up!
(he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like…)ayyyayyyy!
i have no idea!
uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.
i think she is lonely.
i know.
no, no.
she is way to emotional.
and by emotional i mean crazy.
mm-hmm.
she is—she is emotional, but, but ballsy.
and you thought she was going to be in our way!
so, why do not you, uh, open the champagne, and I will be right back.
I have got a surprise for you.
(fakes a laugh) please start drinking!
(exits) (handing mona the present) happy valentine’s day!
…or something to remember me by.
hey, hey, man!
uh…mona just dumped me.
well, with everything that is been going on lately, i have not exactly been the perfect boyfriend.
you know, i, uh, i did not tell her i got rachel pregnant.
i gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed!
and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me.
in a way, i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
yeah.
wait a minute.
what are you doing here?
joey tribbiani without a date on valentine’s day?
what is going on, huh?
girl trouble?
really?!
oh, sorry.
well, look, maybe i can help you with it.
hey, whatever it is, i am sure it has happened to me.
y’know, actually once—once i got dumped during sex.
anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
c’mon!
joey!
what is it?
hey, hey, it is me.
why can not you tell me?
she is not a tribbiani?
i knew it.
so, is she someone from work?
well, uh, does she like you?
why not?
so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?
okay.
um… is he a good guy?
then talk to him!
he might be fine with it.
joey, it is worth finding out.
i mean, if you really like her.
okay, joey, you know what?
you have to go for it.
how often does this happen to you, huh?
you owe it to yourself.
I am going to…uh…I am going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay?
and tell me how it goes.
(walks towards the door until…) where did you get fruit at four in the morning?
aww, is it broken?
mon?
wait a minute, look.
look, look, look.
it is an empty apartment.
we are all alone in an empty apartment.
there it is.
hey.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
you looked at her.
you never look.
you just answer, it is just a reflex.
do i look fat?
nooo!
is she prettier than i am?
noo!
does size matter?
and it works both ways.
okay, for instance.
let us say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options.
option number 1 she will take a cab home from the airport.
option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim.
which do you do?
(buzzes) wrong!
now you are single.
it is actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate.
that way she knows you love her.
oh.
uh, yeah, yeah I will, I am right behind you.
bye sweetie.
(blows her a kiss) okay the sleeping thing.
very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
noo!
no, not cuddlily, not me, just her.
I am like you, i need the room.
okay, come here.
(they sit on the couch and ross puts his hands on chandler's shoulder and thigh.)
okay, you are in bed...
I am going to use the cushion.
okay, you are in bed.
she is over on your side, cuddling.
now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed.
and then you rollll a-way.
hug for her!
roll for you.
yep.
shoot.
oh my god, you have got a crush on your sister's stalker.
what are you talking about?
what?
well, are not you forgetin' something?
what, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name?
dad!
look, you can not do this mon.
all right, if you do this, I am, I am going to, I am, I am going to.....
I am going to tell mom.
crazy.
(interrupting her) oh, it is not the ideal way... how is the maniac?
you are taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
(entering) hello.
(sees joey) hey.
(walks into the living room) uh, chan, can i uh, can i talk to you for a second?
just one uh, one additional relationship thought.
probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!
(smacks chandler over the head with a magazine) so you two are..?
and have you .. ed?
but if i had not walked in here, would you..?
I am not going nuts.
do you see me go nuts?
hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then I am happy for you.
(squeaky.)
I am fine!
absolutely.
(very squeaky.)
I am fine!
totally fine.
i do not know why it is coming out all loud and squeaky, because really, (deep voice) I am fine.
I am not saying i was not a little surprised to see you guys kissing.
i mean, at first i was like..
(screams.)
but now that I have had time to absorb it; loving this.
it is all working out!
me & charlie, and you two.
you know what we should do?
no.
we should all have dinner.
yes, we will do it tomorrow night.
I will cook!!
weird?
what?
what is weird?
the only thing weird would be if someone did not like mexican food, because I am making fajitas!!
(storms off.)
i thought i heard voices!
hi charlie!
(kisses her.)
hi joey.
(hugs him.)
and.. oh!
you are going to have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.
(laughs.)
I am just kidding, i know rachel, i know.
(he squeezes her hand.)
come, please come in.
come in.
oh!
that is so thoughtful.
(to joey.)
she is a keeper.
and what did you bring me?
(grabs the bag that charlie brought for joey.)
underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd.
i can use all these things!!
what?
fine?
because i am!
are not you?
are not you?
are not you?
you see?
who else is fine?
you know what?
that is a very good idea.
I am going to go make a pitcher of margaritas.
the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
oh, guys, this is fun, is not it?
you know?
just the four of us.
just hangin'.
I am fine!
hey, I am great!
I am just..
I am just proud of us.
there is no weirdness, no tension.
we make a great foursome.
we should do more stuff together.
ooh!
let us take a trip.
okay, where do you think we - we can go?
my fajitas!!
fajitas!
be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
that is going to hurt tomorrow!
everyone?
i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.
and to love.
ah, love.
l-of-v-e, love.
l is for life.
and what is life without love?
of is for "oh, wow!"
the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which I am still fine with by the way.
e is for how extremely normal i find it.
that you two are together.
and now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
totally.
no!
was not it?
and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel.
okay.
okay, i guess it is just flan for three!
hey, hey, that rhymed!
oh, oh.
of course.
god, I am so stupid.
you guys are a couple now.
i mean, you probably just want to be alone.
hey, hey, it is fine.
it is totally fine.
we have got plenty of margaritas.
it is all good.
i do not even know what that is for.
thanks.
did you stay here all night?
so you took off my pants and shoes?
what do you mean?
hey, what are you talking about?
I am fine!
except we are not.
i mean, we have not been a couple in like, six years.
oh my god, is that right?
has it been that long?
this is crazy.
i mean, six years?
and because of me you guys are not going to be together?
can i ask you something?
really, what is this thing with you and rachel?
joey.
and she feels the same way?
well, then, maybe it is time we all moved on.
no, but i want to be.
hey, i will be.
besides, I am with charlie, right?
oh my god, I am still with charlie, are not i?
i mean, she did not see the dance, did she?
yeah, I am sure.
hey!
oh, that.
umm, she took it really well.
no.
i am not in love with her.
she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, did not tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset.
i-i just comforted her, as a friend.
it is nothing, i just gave her a hug.
it is also a sign of friendship.
(grabs back his cookie) it was a hug!
s-s-smell her hair?
what if i did?
i was hugging her as a friend.
it is not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she is got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.
(phoebe raises her eyebrows.)
what?!
oh, that does not mean i have feelings for rachel!
maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts!
(grabbing back his coffee) if the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place!
(entering) hey!
rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
okay, there is this guy, warren, from the museum and he is going on a dig for like two years and he is got this great place he needs to sublet.
so uh, you interested?
do not thank me!
if you want to thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.
(rachel just looks at him.)
here is warren’s number.
okay, you go grab it!
i do not know what you are talking about.
look, i do not re-love her.
look, we are just friends now!
okay?
why would i do anything stupid?
you can live with me.
what?
uh-huh.
(phoebe grunts.)
well, I am-I am just glad i could, y’know, help you out.
hero, i uh, i do not know—well, all right.
oh please!
(he sits down.)
(to phoebe) you are going to say things now, are not ya?
hey!
oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff.
what do you mean, they are not moving in?
they-they are still moving in right?
what?!
over a stupid room!
oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!
what is all this about you guys fighting?!
is this really over a room?!
i mean, that is so silly!
well, apparently not, and i can not just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.
i mean, enough of the silliness!
(stopping them) okay-okay!
two very good points, look I have known you both a long time, and I have never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you have been since you have got together.
do you really want to throw that all away over a room?
that is so silly.
now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
okay!
all right!
now, chandler you-you want to live with monica, right?
and mon, you want to live with chandler, do not ya?
(jumping up) good!
a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york!
(storms out.)
(entering) hey rach!
you are never going to believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again.
that is great news right—i mean for them.
right?
yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
wh-why?!
why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
no!
no!
no!
it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place?
good!
me neither!
so it is not a problem.
we are just two friends who happen to be roommates.
really?!
we are?
ohh!
that would be great.
(laughs as well, but for a different reason) yeah, i did not think of that.
so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?!
i mean it is a really big step!
and-and what is the rush?!
no, i-i-I am serious, okay?
i mean, think about it.
you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!
okay, there are no stupid fights!!
this is not about the room, this is about what the room…represents!
and unfortunately, this room (points to rachel’s room) could destroy you!!
fine!
it is your life!
(starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.)
i just do not want to see you guys break up!
which you will do if you move in together, (monica and chandler just stare at him.)
but that is what you want, there is nothing i can do.
(opens the door and tries one more time.)
do not do it!!!!!
(finally leaves.)
(to rachel) so umm, where are the other guys?
fighting?!
yeah.
there is no breaking them up, is there?
sure!
here.
(hands her his keys.)
yeah, I am-I am sure.
(deadpan) yeah, get out of here before i change my mind.
(she exits) I have been back and forth.
ehh, i do not, i do not think so.
she is already talked about y’know, dating other guys.
yeah, well, m-maybe you are right.
is that what i want?
whoa!
whoa!
whoa, joey!
oh cool!
well do you want some help?
awesome!
(simultaneously with chandler) yeah!
well uh, i-I am a paleontologist.
umm, i-i live in new york.
i have a son ben.
uh, hi ben!
(waves.)
and uh… I am sorry, i do not believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
the wheel has not been my friend tonight joey.
uh, I will take another question.
it is okay, I am ready.
(exhaling) the fear of triscuts!
it is possible, they have really sharp edges.
wait a minute, i-i believe I am entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn?
y’know what?
you are just upset because you are losing.
what?!
(to chandler) you do not think it is a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘because you… (excited and simultaneously as chandler) hungry monkey!
(to chandler) haaa!
(to joey) I would like a wicked wango card!
(thinking) oh.
(pause) oh!
oh my god!
okay, i know this, give me-give me a second!
shut up!
i dream of genie!
I would like to spin the wheel!
is there a hopping bonus?
ben franklin.
queen victoria.
noooo!!!
every time!!!
yeah!!
(entering, out of breath) hey!
i just bamboozled chandler!
(flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.)
which is not uh sexual thing.
that was a quick shower.
wow!
it looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
(excited) a play-dough barber shop?
uh, what?
what—you are not serious.
i mean she is a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her.
she will drive us totally crazy.
hi roomie!
(hugs her and looks at rachel.)
well we…we do not have a garage.
y’know what?
maybe, mrs. green, it is not absolutely vital that you live with us.
I am-I am sure that is not true.
well uh, y’know what?
even if she does not know anything, i do!
i have a son.
and his mother and i did not live together, and whenever he was with me i took care of him all the time, by myself.
yeah.
that is a different issue.
uh, the point is, when the baby comes i will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her.
and more than that i want to do all those things.
yes!
yes, you are going to be so missed.
well you are going to be a wonderful grandma.
(they hug.)
oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way.
you will—you are going to pick it up.
(rachel does not believe that.)
hey!
you will!
uh look, y’know when you first came to the city?
you were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card.
do you remember?
look at you!
what—you are-you are this big executive!
you are much more capable than you give yourself credit for.
i-i have no doubt you are going to be an incredible mother.
I am telling you.
oh.
(rachel and he start to stand up.)
you sure?
all right then.
(gets up, in an announcer’s voice) rachel green!
let us play bamboozled!
(reading from a note card.)
how do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
excellent!
how do you put a baby down for a nap?
that is correct!
this is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
(makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
excellent!
excellent, now-now do you want another question or a wicked wango card?
oh, I am sorry you have been bamboozled!
you are going to be a terrible mother!
(rachel stares at him agape.)
I have lost sight of why we are doing this!
(rachel gets up and walks away.)
what is the matter?
you okay?
okay.
yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too.
yeah, i kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
sorry, I am kind of keeping this one on the q.t.
what?
a brain transplant?!
it is ridiculous!
(to monica and rachel) it is winter, they are fewer people on the street.
(rachel and monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
what?!
oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots.
well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more… how did you know about that?!
were you the ones called the cops?!
why not?
come on that is not fair!
i mean you have not even heard me play!
no, you have heard my practice.
okay?
just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want.
and I am not going to tell you what song I am going to play either.
but uh, let us just say when it is over I will bet there will be a we bit of celebration.
…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
(to rachel) do you want to start telling secrets?
(stands up) now umm, remember I am still learning.
one, two, three, four!
you know the song!
sing along!
so?
you know the song!
sing along!
uh, rach, we are running low on resumes over here.
rach, did you proofread these?
uh, nothing, I am sure they will be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
i do not know.
no, it is not just that.
it is just—i want someone who... who does something for me, y'know?
who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at rachel) what?
who?
look, i am totally, totally over her, ok, i just... (rachel comes over, ross lays head on table): hiiii!
we are fine, we are fine.
uhhhh... joey cried last night.
oh, guys, you should have seen him.
'read  them and weep.'
no, women are welcome to play.
excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
no.
no, uh, phoebs?
you can not—you can not do... no, no.
uh... no, see, uh, you-you can not do that.
oh, you are... (gives up) alright, now, you sure?
phoebe just threw away two jacks because they did not look happy... the game, rachel, the game.
you owe us money for the game.
well that is fine with me.
could use the money.
(pause)...yeah.
look, rachel, this is poker.
i play to win, alright?
in order for me to win, other people have to lose.
so if you are going to play poker with me, do not expect me to be a 'nice guy,' ok?
because once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times) I am not a nice guy.
alright boys, let us eat.
you still on that?
you are way off, pal.
um.... no.
see, i might have had feelings for her at one time—not any more.
i just—i... marcel!
where are you going with that disc?
you are not putting that on again!
marcel, ok—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
alright.
I am going to pay for that tonight.
hey.
uh, rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
alright.
so, phoebs owes $7.50, monica, you owe $10, and rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
well, that just leaves the big green poker machine, who owes fifteen... so, you gals want to hand over your money now?
that way, we do not have to go through the formality of actually playing.
uh... to the bathroom.
i want to go to the bathroom.
(exits) alright.
(to rachel): your money's mine, green.
well, you better hop outta the shower, because... i got to flush.
(lays down cards) oh, i am very in.
no, not this time.
(he folds) so... what did you have?
come on, show them to me.
(reaches for her cards, rachel covers them up) show them to me!
let me see!
show them!
first of all, I am not losing... let us not talk about losing.
just deal the... (mimicking rachel) mee mee, mee-mee mee.
I am in for fifty cents.
(throws it in) i thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
no, i fold.
(lays cards down, and gets up) I am in.
(throws in chips) one.
(rachel gives him the card.)
i bet two dollars.
(throws it in) i see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.
(throws it in) (to joey): joey, I am a little shy.
fifteen.
thank you.
(to rachel): ok, i am calling your seventeen.
what do you got?
you got me.
oh, well, when you do not have the cards, you do not have the cards, you know.
(looks at rachel) but, uh... look how happy she is.
(smiles) uh.... bean!
bean!
a lot of people are thankful for those.
hey amy.
that was me.
sure, we do not live there but... i know, i mean a phd is just as good as an md.
do not say that.
sure, you want to go upstairs?
you know, i think that is a great idea.
it will be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis.
ok, fine, but i do not want them bonding to much.
i do not want her telling emma she needs a nose job.
emma.
well we have not offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler.
well.. its just.
its just in that case, then um.
emma would go to my parents.
yeah and we would want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh.
uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
no, you both are equally capable.
its just.. you are strongest when.. when you are together.
sure, monica would have to give her up.
hey dude, you okay?
sorry about before.
emma.
dude.
well done.
you know what?
if i die, and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma.
so, so now do i get joey?
(only half-paying attention) yes, of course they like you!
(not paying attention) yeah, they do not like you.
i dunno, maybe it is because you are really sarcastic.
or maybe it is because you uh- (trying to act manly in front of janine) no i do not want to play video games, joey!
for real?
yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it is my sister.
but, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women.
yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
and the place looks so nice!
happy thanksgiving!
see ya!
oh, oh, we did say we would stop by this little thing joey’s roommate is having.
some would say she is attractive, yes.
(to joey) dude, we were good!
oh, but-but it is, uh, it is just like the first thanksgiving, when the indians and the pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
yeah, yeah, what is it?
w-what was the one right before bananas?
beef in a dessert?!
i- no no no, there is no way!
oh my god, the pages are stuck together!
oh my god, she-she made half a english trifle, and half a...sheperd’s pie!
no, no, we will.
we just will not tell her she messed up.
yeah, it will be like a funny thanksgiving story!
(worried) dude, i need to talk to you a sec.
okay, i think i might know why my parents do not like you.
okay, remember, we were young.
hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
i do not know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I am I am sorry.
i-i did not think it would matter.
how was i supposed to know we would end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
i do not know, i-i was all high.
okay, okay, I will tell ‘them it was not chandler who got high.
now who should i say it was?
alright, alright, now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it?
okay, fine!
oh, uh, can it wait a second joey?
i have to tell my parents something.
no it can not?
okay.
what?!
what is with everybody?
it is thanksgiving, not...truth-day!
okay, okay, we will just get everyone to act like they like it.
that-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie!
(referring to the dancers.)
hey rach, can i talk to you outside for a second?
so um...thanksgiving.
the holiday season is upon us, hm?
and um...you look nice today.
what?
(shocked) eh?
(cutting her off) you are alone.
(just trying to get out of the conversation) ah well, can not blame a guy for trying!
wha?
no no!
ah!
(ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second.
he looks like he is going to throw up.)
(lying) all gone!
so good!
maybe chandler has some left.
it tastes like feet!
are you kidding?
oh yeah, about telling mom and dad, i was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
wha-what?
(in a 5 year old’s tone) (to monica) you are such a tattletale!
mom, dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me.
I am sorry.
yeah, well, hurricane gloria did not break the porch swing, monica did!
monica and chandler are living together!
i-i uh, i got tricked into all those things!
sure.
yeah.
uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
okay, hopefully this time mom will not boo you.
hey!
aww that is so cool.
(picking up chi-chi’s picture) aww!
chi-chi!
oh, i loved this dog!
y’know monica could not get braces because chi-chi needed knee surgery.
you were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
ah, actually, I am sorry we-we probably should get going.
well, there is an arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
so uh, he seems like a nice guy.
ya want to hang back and take our own cab?
hi!
(kisses his mom.)
hey mom.
that is a good question, dad.
that is a good question… wha—what?
dad so what we have to pretend that we are married?
can you believe that?
no, us having to lie about being married.
hi aunt lisa, uncle dan we love marriage!
hey I am so we were not in the car!
did he ever let up?
(imitating parker) this room!
this night!
that waiter!
his shoes!
i must take a mental picture!
(he backs into someone.)
ooh sorry…(he looks behind him then notices its phoebe then stops his impression.)
that depends, how much did you hear?
what was wrong with mona?
yeah baby!
no, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends.
it was a small wedding.
would you excuse us for a second?
(pulls rachel off to the side) umm….
what are you doing?
okay, okay.
ooooh, ooh maybe i rode in on a harley.
well, um, actually, i-i took her to the planetarium.
that is-that is where we had our first date.
um, she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower… then, fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down.
and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "will you marry me?"
oh, no, mom, it is just monica this year.
no, of course, um… um, everybody?
um, i-i just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, rachel (she turns around and smiles), and myself.
umm, that if…if in 35 years, we are half as happy as you guys are, we will count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
…and then, we could have gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would have been no problem?
yeah!
and!
and, it was the easiest 400 bucks I have ever made.
yeah.
i know, i know it was stupid.
no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out.
it is how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me.
it is a good thing i did not do it, because it sounds like it would have been a very expensive wedding.
(rachel laughs) okay, good night even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair would not get messed up?
that is all I am askin’ y’know i do not understand why they did not cry.
it was a beautiful speech.
hey!
all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad!
and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin.
and what you said about nana.
ohh, yeah she really would have wanted to be there.
and you know what?
i think she was.
you sure?
no-no, one daddy, two mommies.
all right, it is all yours.
(ross pushes him off.)
yes!
yes!
yes!!
(everyone stands and claps.)
yeah.
(shocked) what?!
ohh.
that is so unfair!
mine stole my newspaper!
it is like a crime wave!!
(monica runs to make more candy.)
pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike i-i could not stop thinking about it.
i mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so… you like it?
yeah?
ahh.
ah!
(she hugs him.)
well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride.
(stunned at the complement) you are welcome.
phoebe really likes the bike huh?
wait a minute, she was walking the bike?
both times?
pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike do not you?
okay, now just remember everything i taught you and you will be fine.
okay?
here we go.
ready…set… phoebe, you can not get out of this!
okay?
you have to learn how to ride a bike!
well…in-in case of emergency.
well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "you ride this bike or I will sh…I will shoot you."
okay, phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—hey!
I will hold you up and-and push you.
okay?
no!
i swear!
come on.
(she gets on the bike.)
all right, here we go.
all right?
(they start.)
all right.
feel good?
all right, try pedaling.
that is it, your doing great.
doing great!
yes-yes-yes!
take control!
yes!
yes!!
yes!!!
(he starts clapping and phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
i-i just thought you were doing so well.
i… it is a legitimate learning technique.
(looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.)
wow!
hey, there is uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.
need some help?
by the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
(she glares at him and he quickly makes his way to phoebe’s room.)
(entering) look, i-I am really sorry i let go of the bike.
i know.
i know.
but, can we please try it again?
huh?
i mean, you were so close phoebe!
phoebe.
all right, y’know what?
if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I am sorry, I am just going to have to take it back.
because!
because, it-it-it is… it would be like you having this guitar (points to hers) and-and never playing it.
okay, this guitar wants to be played!
and-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you do not ride it you-you are-you are killing its spirit!
(pause) the bike is dying.
great!
great!
(he runs to the door.)
you are making the bike very happy.
oh hey, do not thank me, thank yourself.
you are the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
okay, okay take a guess.
okay, okay, i was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and i typed mine in and guess what came up?
my doctoral dissertation!
it is here!
yeah, it is right-it is right down here!
in the biggest library in the university!
(they start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)
(stopping quickly) oh umm, there is also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina.
(they both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.)
what is that?
people are doing it in front of my book!
my doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, i went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the paleontology section!
let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
great!
because people kept showing up, i think it is like uh-a thing!
oh for cryin’ out loud!
(he storms out.)
excuse me.
hi, I am a professor here.
do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
no!
no!!
no!
can i speak to someone in charge please?!
(the librarian brings his boss over.)
hi, i was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the paleontology section?
see i-i wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
well, fine.
fine!
if-if I am the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I will go up there and defend it myself!
(starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) and do not you follow me!
yes?
yes?!
how can i help you?
oh-oh, you are-you are fellow scholars.
what exactly were you looking for, hmm?
perhaps, (grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps dr. chester stock’s musings on the smiledon californicus?
ah… ah…get out of here!
(the couple retreats.
ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.)
uh, meeting someone?
or-or are you just here to brush up on marion’s views on evolution?
i find marion’s views far to progressionist.
I am a professor here uh, ross…geller.
yes!
you are the person who checked out my book?!
well i uh, i skipped forth grade.
i am very…very sorry.
(to the guard) do not sweat it, I have got this section covered.
yeah, in fact I have got this little baby (turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(the guard walks away)—okay, see you later.
wow, did not know that!
may i say how lovely you look today?
thanks.
(phoebe gets up to get a refill.)
(to monica) oh!
so for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
cousin frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.
no.
well l-look okay, it is probably just a mistake.
let me call aunt sheryl okay?
maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
y’know, she tried to undress me too.
hey, y’know what nickname never caught on?
the ross-a-tron!
(monica shakes her head in disgust.)
phoebe he is right, that is the rule.
hey joe, while you are over there how about another beer for the ross-a-tron?
(entering) hey.
so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it was not a mistake.
ahh, there is-there is limited seating in the hall.
well yeah, but she does not know that.
i mean, the last time she saw you-you would have turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
oh what is the big deal?!
i was not even invited to the ceremony, just the reception.
and-and y’know what?
if it makes you feel any better, joan and i will just make an appearance and then, and then we will-we will leave early as a sign of protest.
yeah, joan tedeski my date.
she is an assistant professor in the linguistics department.
tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
(interrupting) not broad backed!
what?
i can not cancel on joan!
bec—did you not hear me?!
she is an assistant professor in the linguistics department, okay?
they are wild!
why do you want to come anyway?
okay, all right, I will take you.
I will go call joan.
(does so.)
oh here, i think this is us.
(reading the name cards.)
yeah.
(to monica) stop saying, "blood" to strangers.
oh, hey aunt millie.
yes, yes it is.
it is uh… (aunt millie uses this opportunity to grab ross and kiss him on the lips.
after she leaves ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.)
every time on the lips!
why?!
why on lips?!
now wait a minute, you be nice!
all right?
i did not bring you here so you can ambush her.
that bitch!
(he gets up and they go over to ambush frannie.
monica taps on frannie’s shoulder.)
(to frannie) hi frannie, congratulations.
so it is really a question of who could you have possibly done.
what?
oh, okay.
wait here.
(goes to get it, but before he gets there aunt millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)
well… why?!
why on the lips?!
(he wipes his mouth on monica’s wrap and walks off, leaving aunt millie stunned.)
chandler!!!
chandler!!!
(he opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; chandler and monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)
chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window!
chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister!
now get out here!
what the hell are doing?!!
(to chandler) i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister!

I am going to throw a party.
that is right.
for everyone in the building, and I am going to sit them down and explain to them, i am not a bad guy.

we are talking about my principles!
oh, they will like me.
once they come to my awesome par-tay!

phoebe!
(he grabs her arm to get her attention.)
what are you doing?
you chipped in?!
phoebe!
i can not believe you gave them money!
i thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
yeah, but you are making me look bad!
(trying to get her attention) phoebe?
(tapping her on the shoulder) phoebe?
phoebe?
look, this is a disaster!
can not i please just go?
so uh, what did you tell them about me?

this is fun.
hey rach, remember that whole "we were on a break thing?"
well, I am sorry, will you marry me?

they are just staring at him in shock.)

(starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)
oh, oh, I am, I am, I am sorry sweetie, i was just trying to ah, I am dialing another number.

I am hurt!
I am actually hurt, that you would think that i would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love.

(turns to rachel) hi rach.
(he is puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)
(entering) hi.
(sits down next to her) I am sorry, i was an idiot.
a big idiot.
just you have to realize is, this whole mark thing is kind of hard for me.
well, i was with carol for like eight years and i lost her.
and now if it is possible i think i love you even more.
so, it is hard for me to believe that I am not going to, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
i got to get going.
bye chandler.
oh, I have got to go pick up ben, we have got a play date this afternoon.
oh, just this woman that i met last night at the party.
yeah.
ah, yeah, yeah.
umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing.
and it turns out she is got a boy about ben's age, so we are taking them to a gym-boree class.
why, is that okay?
ahh, no.
are you jealous?
you are totally jealous.
honey, i love you too.
what?
huh.
uh, yeah, i ah, i also need two.
uh, no, it is-it is just this person.
yeah, kind of.

uh, huh.
excuse me, I am sorry, i-i think you may be in our seats.
(looking at ticket) yep!
yeah, see this says d-13, and uh… no, I am good.
(he sits down, stunned.)
(drags chandler over to buffet table) I am telling you, this guy rachel is with is crazy!
okay?
he viscously screamed at total strangers!
i think he is baaad news!
hi!
yeah!
tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, i think he is going to snap.
(he is watching very intently) go?
why?
but-but cailin, he definitely will scream.
uh, oh-ho bye.
one.
look.
look, i was not going to say anything to you, but... all right, i do not think you should be seeing tommy anymore.
no!
the guy is mean.
i mean really mean.
i think you should stay away from him.
no, it is not just ‘because I am jealous.
(both monica and chandler give him a ‘come on’ look) i mean I am not, I am not, I am not jealous, okay?
it is… look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
okay, fine, fine.
you do not want to believe me?
no, that is fine.
(starts to leave) you do not want to believe me, I am mr. funny to you.
mr. funny… (turns around and almost spills his coffee on tommy) whoa, sorry tommy.
umm… okay, it is coffee.
it is-it is hot… (coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into tommy) oh-ho, whoa!
sorry, tommy.
i almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
no, but it is-it is-it is hot!
i can not believe no one believes me!
you do pheebs?
phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is utah.
i had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
(on phone) i-i-i do not care if i said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
(on phone) hello.
emily?
emily!
oh my god!
oh my god, it is emily!
(he picks up a lamp and hands it to chandler, for no reason.)
it is emily everyone!
shush-shush-shhst!
(to emily) hi!
no wait!
look, wait!
okay, you can hang up, but I am going to keep calling!
I am going to, I am going to call everyone in england if that is what it takes to get you to talk to me!
look you are my wife.
we are-we are married.
y'know?
i-i love you.
i-i really miss you.
(to the gang, whispering) she is talking.
(entering) hi!
well, emily's willing to work on the relationship.
in london!
she wants me to move to london.
i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben.
it could happen.
all right emily, as much as i love you, I am sorry, i can not move to london without ben.
yeah, would you please consider moving here?
i mean you were going to move here anyway, why can not you just do that?
oh-oh-okay, but-but i know, that even though I have been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, i mean, i mean you-you-you have to come here.
you have to come here so we can work this out.
all right, did you just say all right?
oh, emily that is, that is so great.
it is going to be so great!
we are going to be like-like-like two idiots in love!
yes, tell me.
i know.
i am, i am so sorry.
again, very sorry.
emily, there is nothing between rachel and me.
okay?
i love you.
oh that is so great!
that is… so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes.
no-no-no!
only if i promise never to see rachel again.
i told her I would have to think about it.
i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision?
(they are all quiet.)
I am actually asking you!
thanks for the help, problem solved.
(wipes his hands.)
(entering) okay, that is it.
i cannot make this decision!
it is too difficult, so I am just going to leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
(he holds up and starts shaking a…) well, i do not know what else to do.
i mean, i either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I am 30!
so-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let us hear it!
because i-i got nothing!
all right, do not be shy, any suggestion will do.
(there are none.)
okay then.
here we go.
magic 8 ball, should i never see rachel again?
(he turns it over and reads the answer) ask again later.
later is not good enough.
(he shakes it up again and reads the answer.)
ask again later.
what the hell!
this is broken!
it-it is broken!
for what?
yeah, i uh, totally forgot about that.
you mind if i take a rain check?
I am waiting for a call from emily.
it is not that easy, there is still a lot of relationship stuff.
just stuff.
y'know kind of what emily wants.
no.
no.
you-you can not help.
i mean, i kind of have to do this without your help.
thanks.
(answering the phone.)
hello.
(listens) hi sweetie.
(listens.)
good.
look umm, yes I have been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, i can do it.
(rachel gives him a thumbs up.)
so will you come to new york?
(rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him.
all the time not knowing what is going on.)
y'know if we ever go to war and you are captured, you are in for a big surprise.
oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease… (plays air guitar) bah-bah-bha-bhannn."
then go right into it.
well umm, y’know, i used to play.
yeah, just a little in high school, but then i really got into it in college.
i mean that is-that is when i really found my sound.
yeah.
really?
no.
i mean, nah, i have not played in so long, and-and, well it is-it is really personal stuff, y’know?
no, you guys, i mean my keyboards are all the way up in—no, yeah, okay.
(runs out.)
okay, guys.
here we go.
(plays one note) y’know, I have-I have never played my stuff for anyone before, so it is important that-that you understand it is about communicating very private emotions.
(plays another note) y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems.
that is what I am… really?!
i mean, really?!!
wow!
thanks, you guys.
that is uh—ohhh, i want to, i want to play you another piece!
umm!
uh-oh!
i left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk.
I will be right back!
okay?
(runs to fetch them) this is so nice, I am—i am so… (starts to break up and leaves) (his voice is altered to sound like a computer.)
electrifying.
(he plays the sound of a ticking clock.)
emphatic time-time-time… (with the altered voice) thank you guys-guys-guys… (to phoebe) hey!
oh, thanks, thanks.
so monica tells me that uh, you do not want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent.
is that true?
pheebs… see but, pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then i… i will not play anymore.
yeah, okay.
hey chandler!
saw the new furniture.
very nice.
what?
no the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing joey, he probably just would have just stepped aside.
well, i said-i said something to phoebe.
hey, would it be okay if i wrote a song about this.
thank you, thanks.
(sits down next to the girls) yeah, i lost it.
y’know, I am not going to play anymore, (to phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?
yeah, like i could lose it.
i played bad on purpose guys.
yeah—no, just that last song.
she seems really, really fun!
what?!
so that is two of my wives.
hey!
guess what i got for your wedding!
(holding up his garment bag.)
no.
rachel hooked me up with a tux!
but not just any tux, batman’s tux!
that is right!
made expressly for val kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that batman film he was in.
so?
well, you need something to make this day special?
hello!
you-you-you have the most special thing of all!
you are marrying the woman you love.
pretty please?
not very uh, 007. when i got married you slept with my sister.
hey!
yes.
i find it to be something of a conversation piece.
gunther.
(to chandler) hey-hey!
why do not we put them on?
y’know get a picture of batman and james bond together.
well that stinks.
i was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
what are you kidding?
it is batman’s tux!!
okay, but just the jacket.
double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.
what?
let me see that!
(grabs the invitation and reads it.)
oh man!
well with carol, i promised never to love another woman until the day i die.
she made no such promise.
well, why do not you just start with something simple.
like umm, monica from the moment i met you, i knew i loved you.
...everyone, this is chandler!
(screaming) I am getting married today!!
ahh, whoo-hoo!!
(he runs back out the door.)
hey!
oh, we were helping chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
how is monica coming along with her vows?
i can not believe in four weeks they are going to be married!
phoebe that is not true.
believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
(entering) what is going on?
what?!
what?!
actually, it looks really good.
(turns towards the window and now phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
(he notices something through the window.)
no!
no!
wh… what are you doing?!!
(dr. ledbetter is slowly backing away.)
get off my sister!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it will be okay joe.
that little naked guy would be me.
yes, yes, fine, that is my penis.
can we be grown-ups now?
got me.
looks like a fun gang.
(they all look at each other and smile) (looking) nono, that would be me again.
(to chandler) oh man, this is hilarious.
(quietly) dude!
dude!
how-how did you write this?
you can not do that!
hey!
hey uh mon, i saw the porsche parked out front, can i get the keys?
thought I would take that bad boy out for a little spin.
it is a car monica!
not a rocket ship!
hey!
look rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the porsche I will be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
whew!
that was a brisk ride!
only way to fly.
you are fast and irresponsible.
that adds up to a bad driver.
did you see the look that girl just gave me?
huh?
she must have seen me cruising in the bad boy.
what?!
(checks his hair.)
give-give me a brush.
no way!
fine!
y’know what?
it does not matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
what do you think you are doing?!
there is no way i am letting you drive this car!
so why do not you just hand over the keys?
no ah-ah-ah!
do not start this car!
(she starts the car.)
okay!
okay!
i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now!
(he looks for the twenty rachel stole and does not find it.)
with you?!
yeah right!
(grabbing the car) okay!
okay!
okay!
(he gets in, but into the back seat.)
in the death seat?!!
(shocked) you do not have a valid driver’s license—okay that is it!
pull over right now!
(grabbing the wheel) what-what are you doing?!
are you—okay that is not funny!
just stop horsing around!
okay, stay calm.
nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
i was talking to myself!
you are going down!
yeah, I will get right on that.
no rach!
come on!
no-no!
yeah, I am sure we will not get arrested for this.
oh my god.
dear lord!!
here it comes.
well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
i can handle the stick!!
who?
what?!
what does he want?!
i was not doing anything!
maybe it is uh sergeant sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
(they pull over.)
good evening officer.
ah no.
i do not, but it could not have been more than sixty.
i mean you are not going to give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
y’know of-officer i uh…i had the weirdest dream last night… (laughs) you do not-you do not want to hear about my dream officer…pretty?
i know.
i know.
c'mon, chandler, i love your mom.
i think she is a blast.
oh, please... when did rigatoni get back from rome?
ah, so then his plane did not explode in a big ball of fire?...
just a dream i had- but, phew.
(entering) what is this dive?
only you could have picked this place.
uh, I am not really a shot drinking kind of guy.
...but a man can change.
(downs a shot) anyone want me to appraise anything?
yeah, I am fine, I am fine.
(a woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one) nothing.
nothing nothing nothing.
no.
it is the one he is licking.
you are good.
the girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
when?
the guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
please.
right.
uh-oh... hey, is chandler here?
okay, uh, about last night, um, chandler.. you did not tell... (joey shakes his head) okay, because I am thinking- we do not need to tell chandler, i mean, it was just a kiss, right?
one kiss?
no big deal?
right?
okay.
what code?
uh.. uh.. well, joey and i had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game.
but, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
no, no i do not, because it is being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
okay, I am scum, I am scum.
i do not know, god, i... well, it is not like she is a regular mom, y'know?
she is, she is sexy, she is... well... not in the same way... okay, i think we are getting into a weird area here... hey.
well, not playing raquetball!
he did not get the goggles!
do they wait for me to do this?
why would i tell him?
oh... you are my friend.
i-i had to tell you.
yeah, um, i do not know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he is drun..uh... (he has caught sight of joey scowling at him) i can not do this, i did it, it was me, I am sorry, i kissed your mom.
i was really upset about rachel and paolo, and i think i had too much tequila, and nora- um, mrs. mom- your bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- but nothing happened, nothing- ask joey, joey, uh, came in- thanks, man, big help.
i was not- i mean, i- i know- chandler- chandler- joey- i cannot believe we are having this conversation.
oh, uh, phoebe just started a... chandler, can i just say something?
i-i know you are still mad at me, i just want to say that there were two people there that night.
okay?
two sets of lips.
okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why do not you say something?
(to the rest of central perk) we are rehearsing a greek play.
no!
okay, you mean, you are not going to talk to her, you are not going to tell her how you feel?
okay, 'you' can not, or (points to chandler) you can not?
(chandler grabs his finger) okay, that is my finger.
(chandler twists it and ross goes down on one knee) that is, that is my knee.
(to central perk) still doing the play.
aaah!
ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
you are kidding.
wow!
'kay, wait a minute, are you sure she did not say "when are you going to grow up and realise i am your mom?"
so, what is going on now?
whaddya see?
(very politely) mrs. bing.
you mean that?
yeah?
how did it go?
well, howdya feel?
well, see?
so, maybe it was not such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh?
huh?
(wags his finger at chandler, then puts it down) but.. we do not have to go down that road.
wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'?
tell ya, you do not want to be around when he starts writing with those!
(disinterested) hey-yeah.
(he hurries up to the counter.)
hey gunther, can i have a scone please?
(to the gang.)
want to hear some good news?
someone i know is getting married!
yeah!
and weddings are happy occasions!
oh, by-the-by it is my ex-wife emily!
oh, thanks gunther.
(he takes it, hands the plate it is on to rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.)
stupid british snack food!!!!!!!
(entering from the bathroom) hey pheebs, what is going on?
no!
no!
no!
i was up all night writing this really nasty letter to emily!
it was perfect and now it is all covered in-in… (the duck quacks.)
actually, thanks!
uh actually, i think I am going to skip it.
yeah, I am going to stay and read my book.
i just want to be alone right now.
that is okay, joe.
(licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.)
oh god!
just, y'know out.
i uh, went to a bar.
and then i just uh, just walked around for a while.
look, i do not have to answer your questions!
okay?
I am a big boy, i can do whatever i want!
okay, look, i-i know what you guys are going to say… okay, i did not know you would say that.
look, i did not lose my mind!
okay, janice and i have a lot in common!
we have-we have both been divorced.
we-we both have kids.
i am going to see her again.
(entering) hey guys!
y'know what?
it sounds so weird to say this but, i just had a great day with janice!
yeah!
i opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that is been happening to me.
i mean i talked for hours.
(joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.)
it is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
thanks!
are you sure?
because i can stay out as late as you want.
i told you how I am on sabbatical from work, right?
oh… this is not what i ordered!
man!
can anything go right in my life?!
first my marriage falls apart and then… okay.
sometimes i feel… huh?
let-let me make sure I am hearing this right, you are ending this with me because I am too whiney?
(janice makes an agreeing sound.)
so you are saying, I have become so whiney that i annoy you, janice.
oh…my…god!!
i am now.
dude, we got to talk.
i just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and i hope this is not too weird, but uh, i had uh, a thing with janice.
(he laughs, his real laugh this time.)
what you are-you are not mad?
well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff.
you do not uh, you do not fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they are related to.
okay.
all right.
(running up) hey!
sorry i kept you waiting so long.
oh ah, i think you know where i want to go.
yeah!
yeah!!
I am telling you, i like the food!
did that guy just call you toby?
well, why do not you correct him?
five years?!
chandler you have to tell him!
(laughs) muriel.
wh-why would he call you muriel?
(ross realizes something.)
oh my god!
chandler m bing?
it is not just an m, your middle name is muriel!!
chandler muriel bing.
boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
(entering with a pizza and beer) hey!
so, what do you want to do tonight?
there is a ukrainian film at the angelica that is supposed to be very powerful.
interested?
rach?
you want to come?
a date?
why no, it is the opposite of weird.
it is-it is uh, regular.
it is-it is uh, it is mundane.
it is actually uh, a little dull.
a date?!
she is-she is got a date?!
with who?
you set her up?!
joey what-what were you thinking?!
joey, I am not worried about her!
I am worried about my baby!
whoever she dates my baby dates!
now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?
a ferry?
my baby is going on a ferry?
do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
why do not they just jump out of an airplane?!
huh?!

or burn each other with matches?!
that is fun too!
whew!!
hi.
i-i hear you are going on a ferry tonight.
a bit of a daredevil are we?
okay.
have a great time you guys.
yes it is too slutty!
(joey slams the door before rachel could hear the entire sentence.)
books?
well, i tell you what.
why do not we uh, why do not we just stay here?
let us not see a movie, we will just hang.
hey, if that is what you want to do I am not going to say no.
i just…i have to find out how it went.
this guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
i just—i-i can not believe she is-she is dating?!
i do not know!
i guess i just can not believe any of this is happening.
it is just i always thought when i had another kid it would be different.
now i-i love ben, but every time i have to drop him off at carol and susan’s, it is like—it breaks my heart a little.
i mean I have always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed.
and we all read the paper together.
y’know?
maybe fight over the science section.
no!
no i can not.
i mean rachel’s out with some guy.
my baby went with her.
if anything that picture keeps moving further away.
it used to be.
now she does not really have a face.
smokin’ body though.
no but ahh!
how much easier would it be if it were?
no, it is not what i want either.
i mean i-i can not force myself to fall in love with her again now.
yeah.
(checks his watch) we can still catch that ukrainian film.
hello.
well, how was the date?
uh-huh.
what happened?
ah, he did not uh, take it so well?
oh?
he sounds swell.
hey, want to…want to a little cheering up?
sit down.
guess whose middle name is muriel.
yeah-ha!
I am sorry about your date.
yeah i know.
(pause) on the other hand in um, in about seven months you are going to have something that you are going to love more than any guy you have ever gone out with.
just wait.
wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
you have no idea.
you want to, you want to grab some coffee?
hey, i thought i cheered you up.
right.
good night.
yeah?
oh hi!
wow!
uh…how are you?
oh that is right.
well uh, would you be interested in seeing a ukrainian film?
great!
well umm… sure!
uh, let me get it for ya.
hey joey.
(to rachel) hey you.
you are weird today.
(he turns to rachel and joey puts the ring back.)
(to rachel) listen i uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
uh joey, can you give us just a minute?
what?
hey, where is uh, where is mom?
uh dad, emma’s in the nursery.
I will take you now.
if you want, but (to rachel) i really want to talk to you.
what about ben?
oh well yeah, actually i was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
yeah right.
what?!
when have i ever touched myself in front of you guys?
dad seriously!
y’know you really should see someone about that!
i want to go talk to rachel for a minute, are you going to be okay alone for a bit?
(noticing something) actually umm… (he turns mr. geller’s head to look at emma.)
wow!
kind of uh, kind of a full house here.
I will guess just…I will come back.
(ross exits followed by joey.)
dad, what are you doing?
no!
y’know what?
i do not like you without mom.
(to joey) come on.
(walks away.)
hi!
what, that we had a baby?
come on let us give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
what?
phoebe, there is no secret.
okay?
i did not propose.
(pause) i am a doctor!
y’know what?
I am just going to go and talk to rachel myself.
no!
no, come on let her sleep!
she is so exhausted.
what?
(motions for phoebe to go outside with him.)
oh my god!
she-she thinks we are engaged!
why?
why?
why would she think we are engaged?!
i did not give her that ring!
no!
it is mine.
yes!
no!
no!!
look.
look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel, but all i wanted to do is if she maybe…kind of…wanted ah…start…things up again.
look, i did not want to rush into anything.
and it seemed like she did not want to either.
but i do not, i do not understand how any of this happened!
what?
did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that i was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
well i did not!
i did not propose!
(pause) unless uh… (pause) did i?
i have not slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something i would do.
hey.
listen, i um… i heard about the engagement.
and confused.
rach, sweetie, i-i um…i did not propose to you.
i do not think you do.
poor baby, you are so tired.
rach, i did not propose to you, joey did not propose to you, and chandler did not propose to you.
joey proposed to you?
hey, wait!
wait-wait-wait!
joey, did you propose to her?
wait!
whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?
whoa!
you were down on one knee?
then what did happen?
whoa!
hey!
whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
what?!
uhh… no.
but i-i was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—i mean that-that was all, rach.
no, you did not!
(to joey) i can not believe you told her i was going to propose!
hey, I am not going to rush into anything!
what?
thank you.
(the nurse exits.)
good weird?
we are so lucky.
look, i-i know it is not a proposal and i do not know where you are, but with everything that is been going on and with emma and…I have been feeling… yeah?
okay, well, that… wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
well good, okay.
i-i, kind of think y’know if we…if… you are wearing the ring.
and you told phoebe you were engaged.
when you thought joey proposed did…did you say yes?
why, why, why would you dream that?
i love it, when we share.
i can not belive you two had sex in her dream.
pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
oh, it is my new beeper.
no, it is for when carol goes into labor.
she can get me wherever i am.
i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo.
college?
oh, oh.
oh, oh.
oh this is it.
oh my god it is baby time.
baby time.
(on phone) yeah, hi, i was just beeped.
(pause) no, andr� is not here.
(to joey) third time today.
(on phone) yes, I am sure... no, sir.
i do not perform those kind of services.
(on phone) yeah, you want 55-jumbo.
yeah, that is right.
that is right, jumbo with a you, sir.
(pause) no, belive me, you do not want me.
judging by his number, I would be a huge disappointment.
(pause) all rightie, bye bye.
oh, oh chandler... 'the hills were alive with the sound of music.'
(on phone) okay, andr� should be there in like 45 minutes.
all rightie, bye bye.
(to phoebe) just easier that way.
was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
you are sure?
nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
huh!
are you not seeing him anymore?
oh, yeah.
it is morphin time!
oh, carol and i have a new system.
if she punches in 911, it means she is having a baby, otherwise i just ignore it.
oh, well this morning he got a call from who i think was our cousin nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than i needed to know.
i thought that was just a rumour.
are you are hands still wet?
I am here.
what?
(his beeper goes off) great, now I am having a baby.
ooh, ooh.
I am having...
I am having a baby.
(jumps back onto the table again) I am having a... where is the phone?
the phone?
I am hurt.
monica, let us go.
come on now people, woman in labor.
yeah, save it for the cab, okay.
what are you doing?
we are going to a hospital.
joey, get out of the fridge.
what is that?
(refering to the sandwich) save it.
monica, come on now.
let us go, baby coming.
that is nice.
get out let us go, come on.
hey!
hey erica, welcome back to town!
(pause) wow, look how big you have gotten.
right, no, i understand.
no, no, i knew (he stares at her breasts).
she brought them up!
(pause) i did not realize you were coming back so soon!
hotel?
why is not she staying with you guys?
erica, those things are not free.
in fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product... oh man, i can not believe you guys are leaving this place.
no, no.
this will always be your place.
it would be too sad.
plus, how much a month does it cost to feed joey?
hey, is chandler here?
we talked about catching a movie.
mhm, (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
what are you guys doing?
you got it!
(monica leaves, ross closes the door).
all right, she is right, we got to get serious.
(he grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) let us put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
chandler, you do not have a sister so you can not understand how much this bums me out.
bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
yeah?
yeah, where is it?
rock on!
hey, where is rach?
great.
here she is!
oh, man!
i can not believe she is actually leaving.
how am i going to say goodbye to rachel?
yeah?
hey, what do you think they are doing in there?
(to phoebe) hey.
what was that all about?
are you kidding?
oh my god... oh, man, I am not going to be able to handle this.
(pause) now i know how my students feel at the end of each year.
and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
(to joey) oh no, she took down monica... and I am the crier in the family.
oh god!
i could be next.
maybe she will not talk with me if it looks like we are deep in converstation.
oh, so that thing you said about the thing.
it really made me think about that other thing.
well it is okay.
chandler is talking to her.
i do not think so.
god!
i can not believe she saved me for last.
(looking out to the balcony) why are they taking so long?
okay, here we go... yeah... huh?
what?
i do not get a goodbye?
unbelievable.
she says goodbye to everyone but me.
well, it needs to be plicit.
no, i do not think so.
(annoyed) of-kay... i mean, do not i deserve anything?
i mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?
(joey gives ross a hug) not from you!
(joey let us go) the hell i do!
i do not get a goodbye?
(talking agitated and angry) everyone gets a goodbye but me?
what have i got to do to get a goodbye, huh?
be best friends with you?
uh, go out with you?
have a baby with you?
oh wait a minute, wait a minute, i did all those things.
oh no, maybe it is me, I am just not giving you enough credit.
uh, i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people.
uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) it is physically impossible.
you know what?
after all we have been through, i can not believe this is how you want to leave things between us.
have a, have a good time in paris.
(he leaves the apartment.
rachel looks kind of desperate.)
that is what it seemed like.
fine, then why did not you say something?
rach!
you keep, you keep... you can not... hey!
uhh, it was okay.
yeah, it was fun.
i guess so.
no.
no.
nothing happened.
i shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
something could have happened.
all right?
she-she really dug my slides.
and-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
anyway, if she, if she was not in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
yeah-uh-huh.
tomorrow night, valentine’s day, the most romantic day of the year.
who knows what could happen?
i might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what i mean.
(while rachel is finishing her rant) okay!
okay!
okay!
it is okay.
(rachel stops.)
it is okay.
hey, it is too weird for you, i will not see her again.
i mean after tomorrow night.
okay!
okay!
ooh-hey-hey-hey!
okay!
okay!
okay!
I will-I will tell her tonight i can not see her anymore.
you want me to call her right now?
well umm, oh!
i might be teaching another class this semester!
hey!
uh, phoebe’s not here is she?
and-and i, and i saw that joey was about to go in, so i ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then i pretended i did not know he was in there.
(they all kind of look at him.)
yeah!
good for you joe!
you damn kids!
you ring my bell one more time, i swear to… (opens the door to find jill standing there.)
ohh, uh jill.
umm, that-that is just a little game i play with the kids down the hall.
umm, they have really taken a liking to me.
(quickly looks out to see if they are watching.)
uhh what is-what is-what is the matter?
of course, what happened?
(let us her in.)
okay, umm… what?
wow!
really?!
well, I would love to!
here, you wait right here and I will go get the projector and my notes!
ohh!
slides are almost ready.
uh okay, well there is-there is wine in the kitchen.
(answering it) hello?
of-okay, rach calm-calm down, okay?
she-she is really upset we are just talking.
so that is the only reason she could be here huh?
it could not have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I am a good listener and i uh i put on a great slide show!
y’know what?
i think i can take care of myself, I will talk to you later.
good-bye.
(hangs up the phone and turns to find jill sitting really close to him.)
whoa!
uh, that was your sister actually.
she-she thinks that you are just using me.
(to rachel) you uh, you may have been right about jill.
umm, she kissed me.
look, i uh, i tried not to kiss her, okay?
let me finish, okay?
she started kissing me and-and i did not stop it.
i guess i-i just was not thinking… oh wait—hold it!
but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing.
look i-i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
no, i mean, look i do not know if anything is going to happen with us, again.
ever.
but i do not want to know that it-it never could.
so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
you are welcome.
(gently kicks her back.)
you take care jill.
hi guys.
rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone.
does not she look cute?
i think she is going to be the hit of the office, huh?
she is going to be hotter than peasant blouses and a-line skirts.
can i get a blue bow?
yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
good one, rach.
rach we have a code brown situation.
alright, but you have to do one sometime.
what?
no, that is illegal.
I am going to have the labor department down her so fast they will not even... what about emma?
we do not have a nanny.
absolutely.
just give me your breast and we will be on our way.
fine, fine.
(to emma) we will have fun, will not we?
yes, we will, yes we will.
(gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)
huh?
so you have to tell monica you do not want to have a baby right now?
(hugs chandler) good-bye.
yeah, and i was really hoping that i could hang out.
what do you feel like doing?
i do not feel like having sex.
maybe we can watch a movie or something.
pants off bing!
hey.
you have a blue tie that would go with this?
emma spit up on mine.
here is an idea.
you walk into a room...take a quick scan!
you know what?
i do not need a tie.
i mean, it is better, open collar.
you know, it is more casual (he leaves.)
(entering) hey!
why are not you guys dressed?
no, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
well, you know, I would feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
really.
hi.
because, I am a stupid, stupid man.
no.
(to rachel) so, um, let us see your pretty close, huh.
make-up's on, hair's done.
yay!
and that takes what?
just six or seven minutes.
no!
do you want to hear it?
uh, huh.
yeah, right after i thank everyone for giving money to the museum, i sing a song about the wonder that is joey.
hey!
wow, hello!
you look great!
you see this, this is a person who is ready to go.
phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
you guys, you know what, you know what, it does not matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops.
so.. that is, that is funny.
change!
look, i do not care it starts at eight, we can not be late.
look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is going to be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
(on machine) "hi rach, are you there?
it is me, pick up.
rachel.
rach!"
nevermind.
it is old, it is definitely old.
did not you hear the, the double beep?
yeah, see mon, listen, listen.
when carol and i broke up, i went through the same thing.
and you know what i did?
i.....got.....dressed.
really, really quickly.
okay, okay.
(rachel starts to follow monica into her room, but ross stops her and sends her back to her room.)
there we go, there we go.
no, no, do not, do not, rub it!
do not!
(clapping) what gets out hummus?!
what gets out hummus?!
okay, look, we have nineteen minutes.
okay, chandler, i want you to go and change!
okay.
and then, when you come back, joey will go change, and he will have vacated the chair.
okay.
okay.
no, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
okay, mon, i really do not think this is the... okay, you are dialing, you are dialing.
oh, great.
it is starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
you do not, you do not know what your wearing?
yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes.
all right, come on, I will just pick something out for you.
look, I am sorry, i thought it looked pretty.
look, i did not recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
not for tonight.
not for tonight!
wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
what?
hey, what you do on your own time... whoa, whoa, whoa.
come on, come on, what.
you took his underwear?
okay, now hold on.
joey, why, why can not you just wear the underwear you are wearing now?
okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
okay, hey, that is okay with me.
two down and i have exactly twelve minutes.... wha, my watch stopped.
my watch.
(shows chandler) okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail is not going around any more.
(grabs chandler's watch) what time is it?
it is 7:33, i have seven minutes.
i have seven minutes!!
just, just, just pick one!
yeah, pants, what, what an idea.
or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants.
look, i do not know what you are trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay.
no, no i do not care if they match.
i do not care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat.
okay.
no, no, no just do it.
go in there and pick something out so we can go.
thank you!
it was, it was her voice.
yay!
no, no, no, no.
tick, tick, tick, tick.
um.
i know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
you are not going to go.
how, how, um how can you not be going?
um, you know, just out of curiosity... right.
right, okay, okay.
I am sorry.
I am sorry i yelled.
no, but, your-your mad.
no.
your not going.
okay.
you know that i-i have to go.
right.
so is it going to be like 'I am abandoning you while your upset.'
no, because your not upset.
about the yelling.
oh, well of course, the humiliating.
so, so wee, we are okay.
we are good.
okay.
honey?
i love you.
(goes to kiss her and she turns away.)
okay, okay.
enough, enough with the lunging.
no!
I am sick of this.
okay.
I have had it up to here with you two!
neither you can come to the party!
you know what i do not care.
the only person i cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she is not even going to go.
look rach, I am sorry.
okay.
look, i-i wa, i was a jerk.
I am sorry i yelled.
i want you there, i need you there.
look, what, what can i do that can show you how much, how much i want you to be there.
hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
what?
okay, okay.
if that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much i want you there.
then that is what I will do.
i think this will be fine.
okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it.
cheers.
(starts to drink, but rachel stops him just before he starts drinking) you will?!
well, yeah.
(to joey) how 'bout instead you, go get changed!
(to chandler) you, give him back his underwear!
I am going to go get a cab, and i want everyone down stairs in two minutes!
monica!
(entering) okay, okay, okay, I have got two cabs and no people.
go!
go!
go!
rachel!!
(she enters) wow!
you, uh, you look, wow!
so we are a little late.
what?
awwww!!!
wow!
what a pleasure.
you said you would marry joey?
so you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
so when i came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
well, chandler’s my oldest friend, but joey’s my—no!
ah!
(points at rachel) rachel said she would marry you?!
(enters from the bed room) okay i put most of the stuff away.
in the closet.
linen closet.
in the hospital.
no i left the diapers at the hospital!
there is some in the bag but I will run out and get some more.
sure what kind?
please take your time, it is an important decision.
not like, say, i know!
deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
blueberry it is.
hey gunther, can i get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
(he puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)
yep.
yep, can you believe it?
huh?
ooh (laughs) you mean like a… huh?
ah actually we do not.
(ross walks off) (turns back) what!
(angrily) you did not do anything wrong?!
okay let us put aside that you (makes quote marks with his fingers.)
"accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (does it again) "accidentally" proposed to rachel.
and i can even understand that you could not tell rachel, but why could not you tell me, huh?
you had all day to and you did not.
not using it right, joe.
I am going to go.
give me the bag.
joey!
I am not going to hit you.
no i do not.
no.
no!
give me the bag.
give me the bag.
joey, give me the bag.
joe I am not kidding… no!
you ducked!!
oh my god, this really hurts!!!
what is the matter with you?!?
why do not we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
i broke my thumb.
you know what, you can go, i just have to fill out some forms.
(tries to hold the pen but can not) why, does it look like I am having trouble with my misshapen claw?
(he hands joey the form) just ross!
you know my birthday.
october 18th.
actually I am a palian… dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
ah, rachel i guess.
just ah… just put roommate.
i do not think that we are.
well, i thought so too, but then she said she would marry you.
yeah that is what she said.
so i do not want to be just anybody.
you know what, it is, it is better this way anyway.
i mean i do not know what i was thinking, going down that road again with us.
it is just much easier if we are just friends who have a kid.
yeah.
yes.
i mean, it is what we always planned.
and if you have a plan, you should stick to it.
that is why they call them plans.
hello?
(pause) I am fine.
hey there you go!
(smiles because joey used it correctly) hey.
ah i had a little thing with joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
okay.
what, rach?
(smiles) right.
well, that is what I am here for.
(emma starts crying again) want me to get that?
(walking up with rachel and carrying coffee) hey.
sorry.
(glaring at joey) this would be the place where you explain the hat.
hey pheebs, how is it going?
is everything okay?
uhh, pheebs' grandmother just died.
your make-up!
what is the part, anti-man?
hey, how are you holding up?
what happened?
wh-what did he say?!
well, but are not you pissed at him?!
i mean this guy abandoned you!
i got to tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
(getting worked up) i mean i-i-I would walk in there and I would be like, "yo, dad!
you and me outside right now!"
(calming down.)
i kind of scared myself.
well, maybe he just did not want to hurt your feelings.
what kind of problem?
nooooo!
(entering) hey.
listen, i-i need a favor.
umm, i was in the shower, and as i was cleansing myself, i ah, i-i, well i felt something.
no, no, i mean, i mean a thing on my body.
well, i do not know, it is-it is kind of in a place that is not... it is not visually accessible to me, and i was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
(starts to take off his pants) come on you guys, it is no big deal!
(he turns around and shows him his thing.)
well what is it?
is it a mole?
(he moves closer to them, and they jump back.)
well, eww.
what?
is it a pimple?
ahhh.
(entering) hey guys!
well, he said there is definitely nothing to worry about, it is totally benign.
he could not even tell me!
he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality.
and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
at least they knew what yours was.
y'know, yours had a name.
(sarcastic) yeah, that would be cool!
th-th-that is all it is, a third nipple.
y'know?
just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
y'know?
you can take it off.
just slice that baby right off!
just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
no?
well then, what is it?!
y'know i have dinner plans!!
yes, and the dimmer switch.
hey, you got to get mom on the phone.
call mom!
call mom!
monica’s right.
we are talking about getting married here.
okay?
she-she can not just rush into this.
thank you, but i want to remove it pheebs.
i do not want to make it savory.
give me this.
(grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)
hi.
listen, i got to tell you I have-I have never been to a guru before, so... what is a koondis?
i guess it is worth a try.

oh god!

hey!
(congratulates him) hey!

hey joey!

of course it is.
yeah, come on in.
ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.
(he pretends he is surfing by the window.)
yes.
i lived with you guys for a while and then i found this place.
(joey just stares at him) I am ross.
you got ink on your lip.
(to the woman checking her mail next to him) hey!
(to the woman checking her mail) who is not?
i do not, i do not think we have meet.
i-I am ross.
nevermind!
(goes back to his mailbox.)
i had just moved in.
thank you!
listen umm… jen, i know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise) but uh, would you maybe want to grab a cup of coffee sometime, or… umm?
i will give you a call.
okay!
so uhh, you ready?
sure.
(he opens the door to joey.
needless to say, joey's stunned.)
joey… (from his apartment) man!
they cannot get enough!
(makes like he is a robot and waves at the cutouts.)
i do not know whether he is testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control.
but, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
and then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before i did, and peed all over the crossword.
oh, pheebs, I am sorry, I have got to go.
I have got lamaze class.
no, susan’s going to be there too.
we have got dads, we have got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
no, no.
(distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) i mean, it mighta been at first, but by now i, i think I am pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
i know.
hi, um, I am err, (has to clear his throat) I am ross geller, and err ah... (pats carol’s bulge) ..that is, that is my boy in there, and uh, (points) this is carol willick, and this... is susan bunch.
susan is um carol’s, just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent until) ..who is next?
susan is carol’s, carol’s, carol’s, friend... like buddies.
you know how close women can get.
although i was married to her.
err, right.
a little.
absolutely.
(turns back to the woman next to him.)
so, twins... hah!
that is like two births.
(he struggles again.)
ouch.
it does not matter.
you do not dip your pen in the company ink.
marcel, marcel, give rossie the remote.
marcel.
marcel, you give rossie the remote right now... marce... you give rossie the remote... relax, I will fix it.
(looking at the remote) how did he do this?
you okay?
you want to watch laverne y shirley?
sorry.
hi.
sorry I am late.
where is, where is carol?
no... no... no.
i think i should stay, i think we should both know what is going on.
okay, I am going to play my sperm card one more time.
i see.
so what do you propose to do?
flip me for it?
no, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
susan, go deep.
carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s going to be alright.
I am going to be a father.
i always knew i was having a baby, i just never realised the baby was having me.
aw, how can you say that?
i can not even get marcel to stop eating the bath mat.
how am i going to raise a kid?
no, come on, he does not know this stuff.
if he knew how you felt.
hello!
so, how was the honeymoon?
(glaring at him) yeah, thanks.
(joey nods no problem.)
(laughs) umm that is…that is a little misleading.
the lie you just told.
there is the one!
yes let us.
y’know what?
uh, it is-it is not important.
what is important is that, is that we are having a baby.
and it is not—does not matter who came on to who.
what?
what?!
you were begging me to kiss you!
you-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
yeah!
y’know what?!
it does not matter!
it does not matter what you believe!
what matters is what happened!
y’know what?
y’know what?
rachel, just-just drop it.
i can show you, i have it on videotape!
(stunned silence) it is an expression.
(entering) rachel will not talk to me!
she will not even open the door!
okay, listen i am not a pervert!
filming rachel is not something i planned.
okay look, here is what happened, and joey you-you can back me up on this.
all right, about-about a month and a half ago i came to you with a problem?
umm, a personal thing.
about…about sex?
(joey looks at him confused) that i had not had sex in months?
hey!
do you have a minute?
I would like to talk to you about something I am, I am really uncomfortable talking about.
i actually had a topic in mind!
I am, I am kind of going through a dry spell, sex wise.
five to be lying, six.
well, i mean it is not all bad.
I am learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life.
like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
please, help me!
i have a date tonight.
it has to go well okay—I am scared for my health!
really?
well then tell it to me.
(sarcastic) I will try to control myself.
(laughs) you were backpacking across western europe?
(stopping him) okay!
okay!
okay.
I am sorry.
please, please, you were in western europe and?
(intently listening) why?
it is from france…in europe…western europe.
y’know umm, a few years ago i actually was backpacking across western europe.
uh-hmm—wait!
it gets better.
um, yeah i was in barcelona.
anyway, umm so i was um, i was hiking… (whines) oh that is great!
i was hiking along the foothills of mount tibidaybo… okay!
do you want to tell the story?!
great!
I am across the street having sex with her right now.
your story sucks!
no!
no, i do not…do not want to.
i was backpacking across western europe.
i was just outside barcelona, hiking… it is been six months!
I am always hot!
I will try that.
thanks.
thanks.
and-and hey joe?
listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I will help you out.
hello!
can i get you anything?
huh?
lens cleaner?
your battery okay?
(rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and ross jumps up.)
rachel!
hi!
that is less embarrassing, yes.
yes i was.
(voiceover) so when she came in, i got distracted and totally forgot about the camera.
[cut back to the present day.]
it kept rolling and recorded everything.
what a great idea!
that will get rachel to forgive me!
thank you.
(joey mouths to ross, "you will show me right?")
no!
joey!
no!
look, it was accident!
okay?
i-i feel bad that it happened, but i swear, i did not even watch it!
anyway, here.
(he takes the tape out of his coat pocket.)
i thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
(tosses her the tape.)
forget it, she is destroying it.
look, forget it phoebe.
okay?
it is rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it.
and she wants to destroy it.
so, end of story.
what?!
i do not want people to see it for your sake.
rachel, please… fine.
fine, but i want the record to show that i tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I am going to be saying…(he laughs and points at rachel sarcastically.)
(on tape) hello!
can i get you anything?
(on tape) you did not do it?
(pause) not on the ones we sent out.
(on tape) i know.
hey remember…remember the night they got engaged?
how uh, you and i almost… (on tape) i mean i…i know i wanted to.
i just, i just was not sure if you wanted to.
(on tape) so we…we both wanted to.
(on tape) yeah.
(pause) anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
and in about five seconds you are going to see why.
now I am so happy.
hi.
yeah.
listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really does not matter.
i mean, i think it would have happened either way.
i mean if you had not initiated it i-i-i know i would have.
it was.
it was an amazing night.
i uh… i do not know.
i mean i…i honestly did not watch it.
uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
good luck.
mind if i mute?
oh, oh there go the clothes.
six months rachel, six months.
hey.
we-we look…we look pretty good.
oh nice tan!
ah….
i have been working out.
oh that is not pretty.
no!
oh no!
oh no!!
no!!
no!!!
and that is why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break.
(baby talk) yes we were!
yes we were!
(picks emma up) come here gorgeous.
(puts her on his knees and talks to her) oh!
look at you!
you are the cutest little baby ever!
you are just a... a little bitty baby, you know that?
but you have got... (in a softer voice) you have got big beautiful eyes... yes you do... and a... and a big round belly.
(emphasises the b's) big baby butt!
i like big butts.
(raps) i like big butts and i cannot lie / you other brothers can not deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get...(emma laughs) oh my god, emma... you are laughing!
oh my god, you have never done that before, have you?
you never done that before... daddy made you laugh, huh?
well, daddy and sir mix alot... what?
what?
you... you want to hear some more?
uhm...(raps) my anaconda do not want none / unless you got buns hon... (emma laughs again and ross looks worried) I am a terrible father!
hi.
guess what?
i made emma laugh today.
yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too.
it was... it was like uhm... (ross tries to impersonate emma's laugh, but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched.
he laughs about himself but then looks at rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.)
only... only not creepy.
i uhm... well, i sang... (rachel gasps) well actually i rapped... baby got back... (rachel's face changes from excited to angry) but you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
please do not take her away from me!
hey!
oh i know, is not it?
ooh... what did you do to get her to laugh?
you sang baby got back did not you?
she sweat, wet.
got it going like a turbo 'vette.
yeah!
yeah!
hell yeah!
shake it!
shake it!
baby got back (then ross turns around and sees their friends standing in the doorway) rachel please!
that is so inappropriate!
(pretend fishing in the living room) ohh, geller’s got one hooked!
ohh!
looks like a big one!
yeah, ohh!
ohh!
(swinging the rod back and forth) it is the classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.)
someone knocked over a lamp.
because there are naked ladies there.
there are naked ladies there too.
come on, man!
just-just take the sweats off.
okay?
just take ‘them off and we will have some fun.
hi!
catch any big fish?
(phoebe, ross, and monica all go over to him.)
are you kidding?!
he has not gotten out of that chair in two days.
hey!
hi!
no.
you want me to take some girl I have never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
all right, I will do it.
please hurry.
when we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet!
who would not be miserable?
I am telling you when i got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
I have got to go, there is a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
(he hangs up and runs out.)
hey!
emily is…incredible.
i mean there-there are no words to describe it, i mean the whole weekend was like a dream.
(sees rachel coming back from the bathroom.)
oh!
and you!
rach!
hey!
you were so right!
uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
i mean, i, i-i admit i-i was not quite there.
y’know, i mean the thought of you and that-that josh guy… joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kind of…y’know.
but now!
I am there!
I am totally there!
I am-I am finally where you are!
yeah, and-and thank you for emily.
happy for you.
(he punches her back.)
look, you guys i just want to say, i really, really appreciate you spending this time with me.
it is been a pretty hard time right now, so i just want to say thanks.
oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board?
huh, huh, what do you think?
(in an irish accent) two days of darts, it will be great!
no, no, no, this weekend guys!
what is going on?
so, for the whole weekend?
yeah, that is okay, i mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I am alone by myself, y'know then i totally, totally understand.
what a pity stay?
pity food?
y'know what that is okay, all right, i do not need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
(entering) hey.
well, oh just ah, i was just wondering, when you and i split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of m*a*s*h and half the hostages coming home?
where is ben?
ahh.
(notices the table) ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
oh!
i thought you guys got married in uh, january?
ah!
(realises) oh.
umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great.
‘because you know love lasts forever, y'know.
nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so rachel and i broke up.
yeah, well.
oh yeah, I would love that.
i guess it all started when rachel got this new job.
(he sits down at the table.)
....right?
right?
i mean it is pretty unbelievable y'know, i mean they just took off, took off without even looking back.
y'know i do not, i do not need them, huh, I have got you guys now as friends, you and susan.
(looking at the page) 717?
(to carol) where is 717?
(he gets up to return the page, carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but ross grabs the last piece.)
hey, you have have more of these for susan right?
pheebs?
what, why are you whispering?
oh, now you want a favour?
well, oh, I am sorry your car broke down pheebs, but I am a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
no, I am not going to pick them up.
no, rachel does not want me to.... yeah, you are right.
we were on a break!!!
okay!!
(grabs the phone) we were, we were..., (calms down) yeah.
where are you?
I will find you.
(hangs up) oh, you-you are-you are one to talk.
he is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I am stepping on some toes here, in which case i can just mosey on, I have got plenty of people to help on the interstate.
excuse me?
(sarcastic) oh please, can not i come to your special, magical cabin?
oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
all right pheebs, your cab’s ready.
you are welcome.
we were on a break!
hey-hey, it is valid okay?
and I am not the only one who thinks so, monica agrees with me.
that is what you said last night.
okay.
obviously not to joey.
(to rachel) look both, joey and monica feel the same way that i do.
no-no-no-no.
i can.
look, you guys, you guys should go.
(joey tries to say something, but ross cuts him off.)
no, I am, you, you planned this all out, and i do not want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
no, no, really, I have got to take the car back anyway, I am spending all day tomorrow with ben, it is fine, no guilt i promise.
okay.
okay.
that would be great.
i know!
(entering) hi!
sorry I am late.
were you sleeping?
oh, great!
listen, oh i had to get you a whole new battery.
i got you the best one i could, ‘because that is not where you want to skimp.
yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
okay.
so they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
(outside the door) so I am going to take off then!
you are really not coming back?
i can not get *enough* dinosaurs!
you got me a cola drink?
well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater.
ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
yeah!
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees... what are you doing here, santa?
I am the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend.
you sent me here to give ben some presents.
remember?
(to chandler) what are you doing?
thank you, but, but you, you got to leave.
because, I am finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you are-you are wrecking it.
I am sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
(in a low voice) answer faster, answer faster!
(in the same low voice) answer better, answer better!
really?
you are not going to return it?
wow, it really is!
oh my god... what, you, you really quit your job?
oh, hey... (reading off his card) "a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet."
-- how did you know?
(mortified) hi.
i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... thanks.
no, no do not!
stop cleansing my aura!
no, just leave my aura alone, okay?
I will be fine, alright?
really, everyone.
i hope she will be very happy.
no i do not, to hell with her, she left me!
no!!
okay?!
why does everyone keep fixating on that?
she did not know, how should i know?
i told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
sorry.
i do not want to be single, okay?
i just... i just- i just want to be married again!
hi.
(in a deep voice) I will have whatever christine is having.
you can see where he would have trouble.
paul the wine guy, paul?
he finally asked you out?
(choked voice) that would be good... (normal voice) no, go on!
it is paul the wine guy!
a wandering?
so rachel, what are you, uh... what are you up to tonight?
right, you are not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... anyway, if you do not feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
okay, sure.
(squatting and reading the instructions) I am supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys.
i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and- i cannot feel my legs.
(clutching a beer can and sniffing) this was carol's favorite beer.
she always drank it out of the can, i should have known.
you guys.
I am divorced!
I am only 26 and I am divorced!
that only took me an hour.
you know what the scariest part is?
what if there is only one woman for everybody, y'know?
i mean what if you get one woman- and that is it?
unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her... i honestly do not know if I am hungry or horny.
(scornful) grab a spoon.
do you know how long it is been since I have grabbed a spoon?
do the words 'billy, do not be a hero' mean anything to you?
y'know, here is the thing.
even if i could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am i going to ask?
(he gazes out of the window.)
i assume we are looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
you got a job?
the word you are looking for is 'anyway'... come on, you made coffee!
you can do anything!
(chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and joey poured their coffee into it.)
c'mon, cut.
cut, cut, cut,... no.
no, i got to go home sometime.
yeah.
mmm.
(they both reach for the last cookie) oh, no- no no no, go- split it?
okay.
(they split it.)
you know you probably did not know this, but back in high school, i had a, um, major crush on you.
you did!
oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother.
oh.
listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out?
sometime?
maybe?
okay... okay, maybe i will... goodnight.
i just grabbed a spoon.
(ross exits and monica has no idea what that means.)
there is an image.
hey!
oh, but I have got tickets to the van gogh exhibit!
I have been waiting like a year for this.
what did you say?
is that supposed to be an insult?
so rach, maybe you and i could fly out together saturday.
yeah?
all right I will call the airlines.
(picks up the phone and does so) (in his head) oh my god!
that is rachel naked!
i can not look at that!
i am looking at this.
(looks back at his book.)
okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—unless she wants me to be looking at that.
she knows I am home.
she knows i can see her.
what kind of game is she playing?
i think maybe someone is lonely tonight.
oh-ho, dr. geller!
stop it!
you are being silly!
or, am i?
hey.
may i come in?
do you want me too?
so do i.
(slowly walks in.)
okay rach, before anything happens (he takes off his coat) i just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.
(turns back to face her.)
this is just about tonight.
i do not to go through with this if it is going to raise the question of "us."
(rachel's confused) okay?
i just want this to be (kicks off his left shoe) about what it is!
(kicks off the other one.)
the physical act of love.
(hisses at her.)
oh so-so you were not trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
you were not trying to entice me with your nakedness.
no!
no!
(grabs his coat) no!
(grabs a shoe.)
no-no-no-no.
(grabs the other one and heads for the door.)
can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
thank you.
all right i guess I am, going to go pack.
(starts to leave) (sarcastic) yep!
that is hilarious!
y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
uh-huh.
but it was a first for the rest of my building.
what?!
you totally get embarrassed!
is that so?
(loudly so that everyone can hear) hey lady!
i do not care how much you want it!
okay?!
i am not going to to have sex with you in the bathroom!
(rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
(to the guy in the window seat next to him) hey!
y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
(he points at rachel.)
what the?
what… ohh, it was the best!
i think the check in is that way.
(points) phoebe!
(they hug.)
hey, you wet my pants!
rach!
wait!
the men's room is that way.
(points in the other direction.
rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
what?
oooohhh, I will bet she is one of those people.
what?
no-no, a lurker.
okay when you are playing a machine and it has not paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then… no.
they swoop in and steal your jackpot.
uh-hmm.
my nana used to do it.
that is how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.
yes, it is a deadly but beautiful sport.
(does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)
what?!
oh my god!
rach-rach, are-are-are you sure?
joey!!
(to joey) thanks man.
hey listen i uh, talked to chandler, sorry about the movie.
your what?
what?!
that is not going to make you any money!
(on the phone) yes, hello.
i have a question.
umm, i used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
(listens) a beard and a moustache.
(listens and laughs) thank you.
(rachel turns around and glares at him.)
no, she did not think so.
(listens) i know it is like (turns and sees rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway, umm well make-up did not cover it and we have tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked.
what-what do we do?
(listens) yeah.
(listens) uh-huh.
(listens) yeah.
(listens) oh!
okay.
(listens) okay, thank you!
(rachel gets excited at his tone.)
(hangs up the phone) yeah, it is not coming off.
umm, he said he thought i was funny.
so…(rachel stares at him.)
okay, look-look umm, let us just go downstairs, we will have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
oh, come on!
rach, it is-it is not that bad.
look, just because some idiot drew on your face does not mean you should not have any fun!
okay?
and besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even going to look at you.
okay?
this is vegas!
hello!
there are tons of other freaks here!
(rachel turns around and glares at him.)
there are tons…of…freaks here.
no other.
no.
come on!
no one will notice, i swear!
okay, there was some staring and pointing.
oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.
(rachel glares at him.)
but who cares?!
because it is all on me!
(rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.)
(watching her.)
that is, one big drink!
(looking at the price list) umm… wow!
that is-that is some pricey nut!
really like those macadamia nuts, huh?
(gets up) all right.
y'know what?
we do not have to go downstairs!
we can bring vegas up to us!
(he grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.)
all right, come on, come on, we will play some blackjack.
here we go.
(deals the cards.)
13.
(does so) oohh, 23.
(rachel looks at him.)
which is what we play to at this casino!
you win 10 dollars!
(holds out a ten.)
you are right!
(gives her the twenty she won.)
(runs out of cards) we need more cards.
that must be our alcohol and beers!
(gets up to answer it.)
ohh, it is joey!
i love joey!
(hugs him.)
I will do it.
hey, whatever you need me to do, I am your man.
(he starts to sit down on the bed.
there is one problem though, he is about two feet to the left of it.
needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.)
(looking up at joey.)
whoa-oh-whoa!
are you, are you okay?
ohh, here is that macadamia nut!
(he puts it in his mouth) nope!
something else.
(throws it back under the bed.)
i want to get out of the room!
y'know, i…i really miss downstairs.
well hello!
I am ross!
excuse me sir, you have got a little something right here.
(he points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
(bowing) hello!
well, hello, mrs. ross!
(throws some rice.)
hey, i thought I would end up kissing charlie too ok?
but surprise!
yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss.
why do you care so much?
oh, i do not know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils... yeah, it is no big deal.
i mean, i just met her and I am fine with it... oh, god.
i forgot how hot she was!
I am going to get some more coffee.
ok. (they both go) uhm no!
think less of you!
no, i do not think less of you.
i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them.
i mean, those people who like someone and do not kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people.
yeah, i know the type.
hi!
(annoyed) oh, do you, do you really?
look, if you do not know what the word "acrimonious" means, just do not use it!
get to the problem!
(looking down) are you wearing two belts?
you were saying you did not want to seem stupid.
you know, i really do not want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
(after a short hesitation) fine.
ok. let us see.
oh, you should take her to the met!
oh, no!
the met!
the metropolitan museum of art.
yeah, most of it it is a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
yeah, uh, uh, ok, there is this great rare bookstore on madison avenue.
you know what?
she loves architecture, you know what you should do?
you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there is this great little pastry shop that she would love.
but I am not!
(pause).
you know what if you are in the mood for thai food... ok. ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that is the antiquities wing.
ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire.
now, do you have any idea what you just said?
ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt m-of-n-a-y.
i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you.
yeah, yeah that means... you know?
we just... we do not have time for this.
ok, but you know what?
i got to say, I am really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
wow.
what does that mean?
ok!
so let us move on to the renaissance?
nah ah!
nah ah!
(stops him form doing so) no no no!
no ad-libbing and dude, you can not touch the paintings.
no!
(slaps his hand) haha!
got ya!
die, die, die!
(recovers his composure and starts typing) respectfully, professor r. geller.
(hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins charlie on the sofa) hey!
hey, how was the met?
yeah?
joey really knows his art, huh?
what do you mean?
(perplexed for a moment) wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?
(shaking head) oh joey, joey!
but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
what?
what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
(slowly) yeah.
but you know what?
i think you should give joey a chance.
i mean, he is a great guy, and sure he does not know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you.
you know, that is the kind of guy joey is.
that was going to be my next argument.
hey!
glad i could help man.
i think it is coming from your bag.
so apparently I am available for lunch.
you are moving?
so does-does joey know you are moving?
that is not really porn.
hey, y’know what and if you are looking for a place?
i just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
well i do not know, but how-how great would that be huh?
you living in my building.
i could help take care of the baby.
i can come over whenever i want.
(rachel looks at him.)
with your permission.
yeah.
yeah.
no.
no you are right.
yeah.
hi.
I am ross geller.
i live in the building.
i-i heard about mrs. verhoeven passing away and I am so sorry for your loss.
what?
oh, thank god!
of course!
uh yeah, she and i would talk all the time in-in (rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room.
(pushes rachel out of the way.)
y’know i would it is just painful.
thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, gunter.
(he translates that phrase into dutch.)
yeah, we are done.
ezel?
ezel?
ezel?
(looks it up in his book.)
really?!
sweet!
okay i-i just have to stop by my place first.
no-no, i-i have to see if this apartment became available.
it is not for me, it is for rachel.
yeah, but when the baby comes she is going to want to move.
yeah, you did not expect her to live there with a baby did you?
(finds the word in the book) ezel!
(reads the translation.)
hey gunther!
you are an ezel!
damnit!
hi.
how is she?
(happily) oh.
(realizes then sadly) oh.
well i uh, i brought her some bloemen.
(flowers in dutch.)
oh i do not know that it would.
all right then.
(follows her in and checks the place out.)
well, the old lady died.
and how do i know?
her dying wish was for one last kiss.
but i do not care, (to rachel) because you got the apartment.
yes!
(stutters looking for words) ezels!!
ah, the heart of every healthy relationship.
honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
spiderman?
thank you.
well i-i-i, that kind of thing requires some serious thought.
first, I will divide my perspective canidates into catergories.... hey.
okay, I have got three of my five.
celebrities I am allowed to sleep with.
yeah, it is hard okay, i only have two spots left.
okay, elizabeth hurely.... susan sarandon.
and!!
isabella rosselini.
(entering) hey!
okay, I am done with my choices, these are final.
(holds up a little card) oh, yeah, well y'know chandler printed it up on his computer.
that would be me.
hey, it is my list.
okay!!
okay!!
heavy thing, not getting lighter!
(to gunther) thank you.
isabella rosselini.
(points to her) damn!
i can not believe i took her off my list.
yeah, maybe.
what you do not think I would go up to her?
yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
okay, hold my crawler.
(to isabella) hi!
hi, I am ross, you do not know me, but I am a big, big fan of yours.
i mean, blue velvet, woo-oo hoo!
um, i was wondering if i could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee?
(gunther hands her change) or maybe reimburse you for that one?
well, yeah, kind of.
um, but that is okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I am allowed to sleep with you.
no, no, no, it is flattery.
oh no, no, no, wait, wait, isabella.
do not, do not just dismiss this so fast.
i mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity... um, yeah.
um, no.
but, okay.
um, see, but that is not the final draft.
yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, chandler (chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so i bumped you for wynona rider, local.
what?
(to the rest of the gang) we are just going to be friends.
and officiating at tonight's blackout, is rabbi tribbiani.
that is my sister.
pheebs, what about you?
disneyland, 1989, 'it is a small world after all.'
the ride broke down.
so, carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom.
step back.
well, it was the only thing to do there that did not have a line.
come on.
(sarcastically) and you did not marry him because...?
probably.
but you know, I will tell you something.
passion is way overrated.
it is.
eventually, it kind of... burns out.
but hopefully, what you are left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism.
so, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there is all that other good stuff.
but, um... i do not think that is going to be you.
uh-uh.
see, i see.... big passion in your future.
mmmm.
i do.
(innocently) what?
(acts surprised) what?
(pause) why not?
no, no, no.
I am not in the zone.
I am taking my time, alright?
I am laying the groundwork.
yeah.
i mean, every day i get just a little bit closer to... i will, i will.
see, I am waiting for the right moment.
(joey looks at him) what?
what, now?
shhhh!
we are shushing... because... we are trying to hear something.
listen.
(everyone is silent) do not you hear that?
see?
(to joey) ok, here goes.
I am going to do it.
you come out there, you are a dead man.
thanks.
(joey hugs him) ok. ok, i have a question.
well, actually, it is not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
ok. here goes.
for a while now, I have been wanting to, um.... yes, yes, that is right... what?
(the cat jumps on his shoulders) ow!
why do not we just put 'poor little tooty' out in the hall?
(nonchalantly) yeah?
(rolling) lucky sixes.... (jealous) so, um... where did paolo come from?
no, i mean tonight, in the building.
suddenly.
into our lives.
that, that is funny... (to joey).... and rachel keeps touching him.
(mocking paolo) blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah.... wha-what did he say that was so funny?
that is... that is classic.
paolo.
hi.
listen.
um, listen.
something you should... know... um, rachel and i... we are kind of a thing.
thing, yes.
thing.
no, no, no.
technically the... sex is not... being had, but that is... see, that is not the point.
see, um, the point is that... rachel and i should be, er, together.
you know, and if you get in the.... um... no, no, that is not where i was going.
er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then i would be, well, very sad.
yeah!
se vice?
so you do know a little english.
do you know the word crapweasel?
that is funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
thank you.
kind of... spooky without any lights.
ok, guys, guys?
i have the definitive one.
mwwwooooo-hah-hah... oh.. oh... oh.
so why do not you quit?
who is maria?
you need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
so you are strong enough to face her on your own?
they make you take an oath?
then how do you explain the toe ring?!
whoa-whoa-whoa, hey!
now remember what we talked about, you got to be strong.
one more time, "hey, do not you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
good!
that is good!
me?
no.
it is okay man, be strong.
(chandler goes into the office.)
no!
and I am not going to be, so you can save you little speech.
and that is funny, why?
or!
or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
and that is not against your oath?!
hello.
we would like to close our accounts.
no-no.
no!
and somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
hey!
oh, I am so glad you guys are here.
I have been dying to tell someone what happened in the paleontology department today.
professor neuman, the head of the department, so….
no, i get to teach one of his advanced classes!
(pause) why did not i get head of the department?
(goes and gets some coffee.)
…which brings us back, of course, to greely’s theory of dominance.
(the bell rings.)
okay, that-that is all for today.
oh, uh does anyone know where the freeman building is?
what?!
that-that is all the way cross town, I am supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
move it!
move it!
move it!!
hey!!!
I am the teacher!!
hello.
(he throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.)
I am sorry I am a little late.
ah—(checks his watch)—whoa!
a lot late.
let me start by uh, by introducing myself, i am professor geller.
(the bell rings.)
so to sum up, I am professor geller.
good job today.
no, i ran.
it was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "get the hell out of my way!"
ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it will take me twice as long.
besides, i teach the class three times a week, who am i?
rockefeller?
well i have to.
okay?
if i do not, they will take the class away from me.
and…i already put it in my family newsletter.
you have seen it, the geller yeller.
besides, i-i think i figured out a much faster route, I am sure i can make it this time.
i just…i just can not be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars.
(he goes to the bathroom as joey enters.)
yeah!!!!
yes, i made it!
I am on time!
(grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.)
okay, why do not we all uh, (exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. where… (exhales again) where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots.
okay, (closes his book.)
umm, why do not, why do not you all start to read, while i—(passes out and collapses.)
phoebe!!
so is everybody here?
i got here a little early myself.
let us begin.
now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.
(he moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time, he is wearing in-line skates and has not taken them off.)
here.
(points to the map, somewhere in the middle east, then spins on the skates and points to the map.)
here.
(china.)
now as for the hydrosaurs… i can not believe you guys are moving in together.
that is, that is great!
i mean...I am happy for you guys.. phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional.
hey!
oh great now you are seeking me out to make jokes?
i mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
why?
never?
wow, are you still going to move in with him?
yeah, marriage... stinks!
i mean if you want to see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving?
get them married.
no, I am sorry.
look i do not think that is what you want to hear right now but i can not help it.
i love marriage.
if you have to call me name, i prefer "ross the divorcer".
it is just cooler.
look, i know my marriage is not exactly work out.
but i love to be that committed to another person.
and carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward.
I am sorry.
but come on!
i mean living together will be great!
i mean you guys have so much fun and you love mike.
yeah see?
and you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what?
you should be.
it is a big deal!
the divorcer, to the rescue!
yeah i just hurt it.
hey!
what do you guys think about this.
"ross: the divorce-force".
hey pheebs, you know I am I am really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful.
good, good.
yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised i do not think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing?
but is that really you?
i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo?
i do not know you would be so bored with marriage.
i mean it is so... normal.
hey hey, can i help?
you know sometimes your words... they hurt.
well, hello, mrs. ross!
(throws some rice.)
why are we in bed together?
(checks) yeah.
no!
but we-we did not have…sex-uh, did we?
i mean, i do not remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
and we did not have sex.
(getting up) tell me about it.
(he sits up on the edge of the bed and has "just married" written on his back.)
hey!
what?
yeah!
what?!
hello!
we did not get married.
we-we-we—i remember being in a chapel.
i—they would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
laugh it up, but the joke’s on you.
because we do not need to get divorced, okay?
we we are just going to get an annulment.
what?
no-no, that is-that is not my thing!
i do not love getting divorced!
hey!
yeah.
yeah, actually um, i wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
I am not going to do that.
(rachel glares at him.)
yes, exactly!
wow!
this is so amazing.
i uh, i really thought I would have to talk you into this more.
I am-I am not kidding.
look i-i, i can not have three failed marriages.
i can not.
okay?
i-i am not going to be that guy!
okay, look, how is this going to affect you?
really?
i mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says ms you check the box that says mrs.!
it is right next to it!
I am asking you to do me a favor.
and as my wife i think you should grant me this favor.
hey!
listen, i know you wanted to talk to me, but i have an idea that may make you want to stay married.
(rachel shakes her head.)
we register, and you get to keep all the presents!
i do not know if it is true.
oh, okay, y’know what this is?
this is a difference of opinion.
and when that happens in a marriage... all right.
all right, I will do it.
hey!
oh, yeah, no problems.
it is all taken care of.
oh yeah, why not?
okay.
(sits down next to phoebe.)
you uh, you want to hear something weird?
i did not get the annulment.
we are still married!
do not tell rachel.
see you later.
(he gets up leaving phoebe in shock.)
hey you guys i got some bad news.
(he sets the stack of papers down on the table.)
no, monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the post.
(they all gasp.)
i did not want her to see it, so i ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies i could find.
(he hands the paper to phoebe and they all read it.)
umm… but the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
yeah, they all know.
(startling him) what?!
what?
are ya?
what are you doing up?
okay look, i had a lot of water before i went to bed.
can we do this after… it is funny you should mention diapers.
okay look, there is nothing to worry about.
we have plenty of time.
there is a great baby furniture store on west 10th.
tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need.
okay?
(interrupting her) okay.
okay.
if uh, if you are going to do this, then I am going to do that.
(points to the bathroom.)
so… (starts for the bathroom.)
(annoyed) yeah!
(stunned) (thinks) well uh… oh.
we are having a baby together, but we are not involved.
(the cashier, a very beautiful woman, looks confused) i mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends.
and then there was one drunken night.
(rachel looks at him angrily) or, yes stranger, we would like this delivered please.
oh, okay.
i chose those, I am a paleontologist.
yeah!
i-i teach it in my class.
that is my gym.
i am like indiana jones.
my son?
pretty serious.
(there is a knock on the door and ross answers it.)
oh hey katie!
(the cashier from before) what uh, what are you doing here?
ah, must have been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
oh.
(reaches into his pocket for some money as rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
oh!
wow!
uh, yeah!
that sounds great.
I am just going to put this (the money) back in my pocket, pretend that did not happen.
uh yeah, actually I am free now.
do you want to grab some coffee or… (to katie) yeah, I am just going to grab my coat.
and uh, and my whip.
(katie looks worried.)
y’know because of the indiana jones?
(katie laughs) not-not because I am-I am into s&m.
(katie’s worried again.)
I am not-I am not into anything weird.
y’know?
just-just normal sex.
(katie is uncomfortable.)
so, I am going to grab my coat.
(does so, leaving katie and rachel alone.)
hey.
how are you?
uhh, it was fun.
we, we just had coffee.
what is uh, what is going on?
do you not, do you not like katie?
i liked her.
did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
why?
what was wrong with her?
okay, so what is the matter?
(laughs) why?
what, what are you jealous?
okay.
i will not date.
I will uh, I will be here, with you, all the time.
true, but you are allowed to be unreasonable.
you are having our baby.
do you feel better?
uh rach?
just one thing umm… we live together.
you are having our baby.
I am not going to see anybody else.
are you-are you sure you do not want something more?
oh-oh, rach!
i was just messin’ around!
(she is stunned) like you did last night when i had to pee?
(pause) okay.
okay.
because for a minute you said you… …that you actually… rach?
the bathroom?
hi.
so uh, emily just went to the airport.
eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it.
and y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so… (thinks about it.)
nah.
well i, that is the thing, i do not know!
i mean, whenever i brought it up with her she said, (in a british accent.)
"this is so fantastic!
why do we have to talk about the future?
let us just enjoy…" and why do you care so much?
you had fantasies about emily?
is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that ukrainian kid?
ahh.
we said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?
what-what is love really?
i am a good kisser.
emily!
(runs up.)
i just, i had to see you one more time before you took-off.
that is, that is, that is a big candy bar.
(she is holding one of those huge toblerone bars.)
i had the most amazing time with you.
(stops her) wait uh, listen.
i-i, i have to tell you something.
umm, I have been thinking, I am just going to come out and say it.
okay?
i-i-i ah, i-i think i love you.
that is no problem.
i did.
thank you.
she said, "thank you."
i said, "i love you."
and she said, "thank you."
what do i do now?
she already lives in london.
okay!
okay!
but if she does not call, it is definitely over!
no, wait.
wait.
unless, eventually, i call her, y’know just to she what is going on, and, and she says she will call me back, but then she does not.
then it is over.
(answers the phone.)
hello?
emily, hi!
uh, how-how was you flight?
no, no, that-that, that is all right.
umm, I am just glad you called.
does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america?
she does not know which one of us she wants, me or this colin guy.
well… I am not proving anything.
okay, I am done listening to you.
if i had not let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, i never would have put my fist through the wall!
no, i missed and hit the door.
but, it opened really hard!
what?
i made fun of his accent.
no.
really?
all right.
all right, I am going to do it!
I am going to, I am going to go to london and I am going to fight for her.
(on phone) hey.
no, because she has not come home yet.
and she has not been home all night!
she is obviously staying with that other guy, and I am the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
about four hours.
(yelling, thinking emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to new york.)
i love you too!
I am, I am going to call you right now from the phone booth!
(realises) you can not hear me.
(goes to make his call.)
hi.
ohh!
thank you.
(gasps) you know what?
this calls for a bottle of israels finest.
so if you take this job you will be moving to paris?
okay.
all right, we will work it out.
yeah, yeah!
(they hug) you sure this is what you want?
well, rachel moving to another country?
not being able to see her every day.
how can i be okay with this?
do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
i do not know.
i could talk to her boss.
yeah!
i met him at that christmas party.
we really hit it off.
i did not say we were brothers.
yeah, I am a friend of rachel green's.
uhm, actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago.
close.
ron.
(shakes hands) uhm, well...
I am here to see if you will give rachel her job back.
oh, no.
at first i have to get you to agree.
then we will see if she wants to come back.
look, she loved her job here.
and let us face it: you are not going to find anyone who did it as well as she did it.
is not that true?
(surprised) huh, i took a shot there.
i see... thanks very much.
(he gets up and walks to the door.
on his way out he looks at the photographs mr zelner has near his door.
he picks one up.)
is this your son?
oh, nothing, it is just, it is close to ron.
does he.. does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants.
(mr. zellner looks shocked).
i just heard it as you must have heard it and that is not good.
let me start again.
I am a paleontologist, you will be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
you let rachel come back, and it is done.
yeah!
yes!
thank you!
this is great.
thank you so much.
and i swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
he will be fine.
hi.
emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house.
you know she can not sleep without it.
ok. nooo!
so, you are not going to paris.
wh… wh…what?
yeeeah!
(they high-five) (enters) it is me.
ron.
(mr. zellner looks annoyed) look, i um, i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
just hear me out.
how would you feel about offering her a raise?
(looks hopeful) perhaps i can persuade you.
what if you can give your son this (takes a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
huh?
so?
we have a deal?
yes!
yes!
oh, (grins) believe me, the ladies, they love it!
good, because the ladies, not so much.
(shakes his head, give him a thumbs up and leaves) hey!
what?
they did?
so, what are you going to do?
that is great!
so you are staying in new york!
you are excited, right?
right!
uhm, i had not no you... i had no idea you were so excited about paris.
uhm, i mean, you said you were scared.
(after a long pause) you should go.
it is what you want.
you should go.
i really do.
(picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to zelner) I am sure he will understand.
yeah... yeah, yeah, oh!
(they hug) then I am happy too.
(they are still hugging - fade out) (entering) hey everybody!
happy thanksgiving!
what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year?
what?
that is like insanely easy!
what?
you forgot fourteen states?
wow, how many have you got?
done!
with time a-to-spare.
you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it is kind of disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can not name all the states.
did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?"
hmm?
what?
that is impossible.
no, just give me another minute.
this-this is crazy!
i can do this!
all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner.
you are on!
pshhshhh!
phoebe, why is your bag moving?
ohio!!
thank you!
what dog?
there-there is no dog here.
are you out of your mind?
right, they are scary.
(he jumps up, screaming) ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
it is too cold.
(to phoebe) it hurts my teeth.
how can i not get this?
I am a college professor; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s.
damn, i forgot you were here.
hey!
what is she doing back here?
hey look, phoebe.
i, uh, i laid out the states geographically... yeah, but, but look what I am... um, in phoebe's room.
you can not go in there.
monica's crying.
she is very upset about this whole clunkers thing.
no.
no, no.
she does not want to see you right now.
because you sent away the dog!
oh, is it?
is it?
look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover.
and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he does not like dogs.
so monica and her friend…phyllis…take away the dog.
and that was the last time we ever saw him.
do not you see?
this is just like that.
only with a few details changed.
from you?
(he does a weird desperate laughter, like he is almost crying) yes, please!
i hate america!
when i finish this game, i swear i am moving.
okay, maybe this is so hard, because there are not 50 states.
let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more!
i-i think, i should be able to eat something.
tag?
y-you are going?
(comes over to tag) uh we did not, uh we did not get the chance to talk.
uh, so, where did you say you are from again?
ah, what good are you.
(walks back to his map dejectedly.)
delaware!
(starting to cry.)
delaware!
(hands chandler his pad and walks in) i want my turkey now!
(pauses) i know.
oh, shhh, shh.
magic is about to happen.
is it?
feels like two.
what?
oh.
hel-lo!
he could never get a woman like that in a million years.
c'mon!
c'mon!
no, of course not!
(thinks) ...yeah, yeah, it is.
well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept.
i mean, anthropologically speaking- fine.
fine, alright, now you will never know.
alright.
there is a theory, put forth by richard leakey- oh yeah, nobody knows.
and we are not supposed to ask.
oh c'mon!
when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that was not raggedy!
alright, you madcap gal.
try to imagine this.
the phone bill arrives, but you do not pay it right away.
because you are a kook!
instead you wait until they send you a notice.
monica?
you are mom.
c'mon, seriously, joey, what is the part?
you are right, you are right, it is...so you going to invite us all to the big opening?
look at it this way: you dumped her.
right?
i mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... tell me why you did this again?
no?
what happened, big guy?
it felt like a 'big guy' moment.
yeah, i mean... i think when it is your shot, y'know, you-you know it is your shot.
did it... feel like your shot..?
she is a kook.
thank you.
boy, we uhm... had not really thought of that.
oh, come on rach, we will.
i promise.
we have more interviews (they sit down and rachel sighs) and worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
she was blonde?
(he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... there is knocking at the door.)
just a sec.!
okay, okay.
this one's name is sandy.
she is got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
and she is a little mannish... are you gay?
(rachel turns to ross in an embarrassed way) (skeptic) so you are just like a... guy who is a nanny?
(on a yeah, right tone) okay.
yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
(in the other room emma starts to cry.)
oh, come on, rach, he is a guy!
because, it is weird!
what kind of job is that for a man?
a nanny?
i-it is like if a woman wanted to be... king?
you got to be at least bi... (very worried) is everything allright?
and I am fine never having heard it... (rachel looks at ross in a "why do you say that" manner) rach, can i... can i see you for a sec?
do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...?
huh?
i have not cried that many times since i moved in.
(picks up a cookie) okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem.
he is too sensitive.
(takes a bite from the cookie) (speaking with his mouth full) yeah, i mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) these are amazing!
this... this is exactly what I am talking about.
what kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh?
they are not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
(takes a careful bite from the cookie) hey... there is sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
oh really?
did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes madeleines?
(looks like in heaven) lighter than air... (changes back to serious) but that is not the point.
(joey now also enters) hey...!
rachel and i hired a male nanny.
thank you!
...a what?
a what?
what is the end of that sentence?
wow!
science...?
academia...?
being a good father...?
uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny.
(joey makes a gesture and sound like "can you believe that?")
hey... i made up that joke and told it to you!
(he points at chandler.
joey gestures to ross "what are you doing?)
yep!
that is my thing... really?
sounded like three blind mice.
(looks angrily at joey and points at him) i swear to god...!
(joey is in shock) okay, okay... how exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
(shakes his head) oh my god!
oh, I am sorry.
please apologise to sandy and the snufflebumps for me.
well, you know what... i-I am sorry I am the only one who is not in love with gary poppins out there... but i just... i can not... i can not go through with this.
no!
hey, you know what?
I am sorry.
i would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with... thank you!
here goes... sandy... hi, we uhm... we kind of need to talk.
I am afraid it is not working out.
yeah, uhm... i mean, rachel and i, think you are great... with emma... uhm... we just feel... i... just feel that the... the chemistry is not right.
I am sorry.
we are... we are more than happy to give you good recommendation... anyway, uhm...well, I am glad there is no hard feelings.
no, you know, it is uhm... nothing you did, it is... it is uhm... my issue.
you know, I am just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who is as sensitive as you.
why... i... i do not know.
(sandy tilts his head again) uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... you know a-a-and as a kid i was not the athlete i am now.
i play squash...!
anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive.
it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "what are you doing with those things?
what is wrong with you, why are not you... why are not you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
i know i am!
(ross now starts to cry) ...and when it is summer, and it is hot, why can not you wear a tank top?
here come some more... not that big a deal?
it is amazing.
ok, you just reach in there, there is one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve.
all right, as far as I am concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close.
am i right?
multiple orgasms!
not even, say, breaking up with janice?
tony?
oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.
(rachel gives him a dirty look) nothing, just, just, I am fine.
that guy, he burns me up.
so, uh, rachel, what are you, uh, what are you doing tonight?
oh, you uh, you want to hear a freaky coincidence?
guess who is doing laundry there too?
me.
was that not clear?
hey, why do not, um, why do not i just join you both, here?
yes, i do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there is a.... rat problem.
apparently they are attracted to the dryer sheets, and they are going in fine, but they are comin' out all.... fluffy.
anyway, say, sevenish?
(on phone) ok, bye.
(hangs up) well, monica's not coming, it is just going to be me and rachel.
it is laundry.
the thinking through is minimal.
nuh-uh.
so what are you saying here?
i should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
(sheepish) no.
ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles?
what, it says I am a sensitive, warm kind of guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear.
ok, i can pick something else up on the way.
what is going on?
was your basket on top?
so?
no suds?
excuse me, hold on a second.
(to woman) that is my friend's machine.
hey, hey, hey, that is not the rule and you know it.
(to the crowd in the laundromat) all right, show's over.
nothing to see here.
(to rachel) ok, let us do laundry.
well, that is because you are such a sweet, gentle, uh...do you, uh, do you...oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
uberveiss.
it is new, it is german, it is extra-tough.
rach, do you uh, are you going to separate those?
rach, have you never done this before?
uh, well, do not worry, I will use the gentle cycle.
ok, um, basically you want to use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
(visibly nervous) uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
that does not sound stupid to me.
you know, it is like the first time i had to make dinner for myself, after carol left me?
(the buzzer on the washer goes off) I am sorry, that is all the time we have.
next on ross...(opens up the washer) uh-oh.
(not wanting to tell her) uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.
it is, uh, it is a song.
the laundry song that we sing.
(singing) uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
nothing, nothing.
lee-lo, the laundry's done.
all right, all right, it is just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kind of pink.
yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red.
I am sorry, please do not be upset, it could happen to anyone.
you got the clothes clean.
now that is the important part.
you were incredible!
brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?
(ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.)
I am fine, I am fine.
no.
yeah.
yeah.
what a beautiful story.
hey, I am fine by the way.
what are you doing?
no thanks.
I am 29. oh sweetie, when do you think you are going to get off tonight?
oh come on, not again.
hmm.
yeah.
now, if you need to stay late, i want to be supportive of that.
and what are you going to do for him?
okay.
so, are you going to see him again?
naked friends.
hey.
oh.
yeah, make that three.
okay.
(goes over to the counter) (to chandler) what ah, what is the matter with you?
what is going on?
what, what do you mean, what?
is he gay?
what?!
are you sure?
(chandler nods: yes!)
hold on.
(walks over behind the couch) I am sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a.... okay.
no, no, that will not be ah, that will not be necessary (leans down and looks up robert’s shorts, seeing robert’s package.)
yeah, yeah, yeah!
well, i suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
umm, jo’s a girl, it is short for josephine.
hey!
how did the ah, basketball go?
calm down.
there is no reason to get testy.
good.
joey’s asking if you have just ruined the first book he is ever loved that did not star jack nicholson?
oh.
he is right, even if it is to say something complementary.
(he stops and thinks about what he just said.)
(to chandler) hey, do not we have to... happy birthday!!!
we have got presents!
oh really.
is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
hey, 30 is not that old!
do you know how old the earth is?
hey!
that was a practical purchase!
i needed that car for transportation!
okay?
i-i have a child!
how hot do i look in this, huh?!
that is not what this is about okay?
i-i am a sports car enthusiast.
i have always been into cars.
(giddy) i do not know, but-but look how shiny!
hop in.
(phoebe hops in.)
get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
damnit!
(shuts the car off.)
okay, forward.
forward—stop!
(the car moves an inch and ross runs to the back of the car.)
okay, back—stop!
(the car barely moves and ross runs back to the front.)
okay, forward—stop!
stop!
stop!
no-no-no!
it is mine!
it is-it is mine.
(the woman walks away.)
maybe that will liven up this party.
(to tag) stick to the list.
always stick to the list.
hey!
look who is back!
it is the birthday girl!
how is the birthday girl feeling?
what?
(glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)
which is fine!
because you just turned—(removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!
(to monica) you are drunk!
mom and dad are going to be maaaaadd!
maybe I am a little drunk.
i really wish that you would not.
come on!
okay, is everybody clear?
we are going to pick it up…and move it.
now all we need is teamwork, okay?
we are going to lift the car…and slide it out.
lift and slide!
(interrupting her) lift!!
and slide!
all right everyone, lift!
(they and try to lift the car, of course it does not raise up) and slide!!
(everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)
god, do you realize in ten years we are going to be 40?
yes!
my baby’s finally free!
(starting it) woohoo!
you want to buy a car?
hey you guys!
hey, what are you doing?
yeah!
there is no way around it pheebs, you just going to have to accept the fact that this is going to cost you a lot of money.
yeah, and I am responsible for just like half of that.
I have got to say you guys, that is an incredible gesture!
no, no, no.
the next time it is going to be a hawaii at sunset.
[pause] but maybe the time after that!
(he enters) hi!
oh, good!
oh, that is ok.
I am sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
there was one!
she is it!
all the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
well, i was thinking of taking emma to the playground!
like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire!
be-caaauuuse... seriously?
(sarcastic) and you made it through that?
i wonder who is going to play you in the movie!
look, I am sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok?
but the swings are perfectly safe, and besides emma loves them.
you know what, you should come with us and you will see!
space is filled with orbiting children.
(pause) look, please, just come on, you know, when you will see the look on emma’s face, i swear you will not regret it.
good, you do not want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
oh, yeah, that is the same, i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
ok. rach, she is got like three hairs!
i promise you she is safe!
no watch how much she loves this.
here we go!
(he starts pushing emma) see, i told you!
oh, absolutely!
ok!
(he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) see?
scared of swings, i bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) ow!
son of a bitch!
(turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) (to the no!
no, no, no, no, okay, it was not the swing's fault.
it was my fault and kind no wait, okay, okay, i have an idea.
i want you to get on the swing, okay?
and look, i just think you are an adult, okay?
and you should get over your silly good.
(he freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) what?
where?
where?
i know.
(rachel bends down to emma and ross looks over his shoulder again, (nervously) ok... (gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) this feels perfectly normal.
ok, get on the swing!
see?
there you go!
good for you!
and you know what, I am actually getting used to this little guy.
i do not really even feel him in here anymore.
well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of the spider) whaa... aaah... aaahhh... yeah!
no.
c'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
yeah, we want everyone to be there.
as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
(he enters) hey guys!
hey, i brought the camera for emma's video.
yeah!
that is the hope!
so, is emma awake yet?
ah, and where is joey?
(taping joey with the cam) hey, there is uncle joey!
hey, say something to emma on her 18th birthday!
joey, no!
when they see this you will be 52!
(points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) hey!
(pointing the camcorder at himself) there is something you did not know about your dad!
oh, great!
thank you so much for that gift!
amazing... amazing.
sure.
uh, rach?
does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes?
say for bachelorette parties?
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny.
(pause).
that is a weird sentence!
hey mon, that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
well, you know what?
while we are waiting, you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday, huh?
(takes the camcorder and points it at monica and chandler) ok!
you guys, just please.. a little bit longer.
i promise, rachel will be back with the cake any minute.
monica, remember.. the frosting?
huh?
(into receiver) hello?
(listens) oh no!
what happened?
(listens some more) ok ok, where are you?
(grabs a pen and starts writing).
ok, I will be right there.
(puts the phone down) no, rachel got pulled over for speeding.
she forgot her licence so now i have to bring it to her.
no, wait !
you guys, no, no, you can not leave!
rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up.
how do you think she is going to feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
joey!
you are in charge, ok?
you make sure nobody leaves!
(leaves) rachel!
(sarcastically) i can not believe they gave you a ticket.
you are such a good driver.
yeah?
hey, maybe i can fix that, you know.
try to turn it into something else.
(he opens the box) rach, she is not going to remember this.
(looks back at the cake) hey!
it is not bad.
well, i just made these two things uhm... cheeks.
and then i split this to make ears.
some can sing, some can dance.
i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
joey, we just saw you come in.
you ran past us on the stairs.
oh my god!
our daughter's a genius!
rach, this means... damnit!
I will put a candle on the cake.
okay, here we go!
emma's first birthday cake... well hey... well, blow out the candle.
come on emma.
what is wrong?
are you okay?
okay, you ready?
a-a-and... record.
(to monica) okay, i know I am not supposed to know, but i do.
and I am so excited for you!
monica’s pregnant!
what?!
what do you mean?
you-you-you are not pregnant?
no!
(pause) I will be right back.
(exits.)
hi.
I am uh, I am ross.
i do not, i do not believe we have met.
I am monica’s older brother.
oh!
hello uh, mona from her restaurant.
(he uses his card to mouth those words.)
(pause) mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
aw come on, mona lisa?
mona umm…clickclocken.
the famous botanist?
huh?
oh no she is uh—well she is dead now.
no, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
linda clickclocken.
(pause) so what uh, what-what table are you at?
(she shows him.)
oh, uh me too.
(sexily) yes there will.
(mona leaves and ross tries to find the same table.)
oh guess what, molly gilbert you have just been bumped up to table one.
and if it is all right with you I am going to take your place at table six—martin clickclocken.
hey!
uh, i thought, i thought you were at table six.
oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading.
well I am… (he goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.)
hello.
it was the chair again!
okay?
I am not doing it!
it what—look, i do not—y’know what—eh-eh… (he walks away and goes over to mona.)
hi.
umm, would you like to dance?
yeah?
oh great!
(they get up to dance and ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
i was not farting!
(to mona) uh, a little game from our table.
(to the little girl) yes?
oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later.
right now, I am about to dance with this lady.
uh, unless!
unless, uh this lady would not mind letting you go first.
yes i-i am.
in fact umm hey, why do not we try it my special way?
you can dance on my feet.
yeah?
hop on.
(they start dancing and mona sits down.)
is the pretty lady looking?
keep dancing.
no-no, thank you miranda.
all right.
(walks over to mona.)
oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
what?
of course you can!
hop on!
i am so going to score.
i like your bow.
(to the second girl) that was very nice ashley.
no-no.
(walks over to mona again.)
oh!
(recoils in horror.)
oh, you-you sure?
(she nods yes.)
okay.
(to the girl) okay.
so what is uh, what is your name.
that is, that is pretty.
(they start to dance and gert tries to step on ross’s feet, but he pulls them out of harm’s way.)
whoa!
whoa!
whoa!
what are you doing there gert?
okay.
(swallows hard.)
hop on gert.
(she does and ross winces in pain.)
I am trying.
(he strains to move his feet.)
maybe i should stand on your feet!
(gert’s shocked and ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)
i just did not see the fast song coming.
oh, thank you.
wait a minute!
no!
I am the nice one!
I am the one who danced with the kids all night!
how…how small are your feet?!
(they all look down.)
so, so, is mike coming to dinner?
actually, um, i was thinking maybe both of us could go.
thanks, i put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
alright, we�ll just, uh, see when you get here.
bye.
(hangs up) huh, that was my mom, she�s stuck in terrible traffic.
oh, what were the other two?
i know, it�s the first time, we�re leaving the baby and � hey, i know how hard it is for you, but � but emma is going to be fine.
my mom is going to be with her.
she�s great with kids.
ya.
hey, you only heard monica�s side of that.
that little fatso was a terror.
rachel, i know that you can.
and you should.
really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don�t you, why don�t you go ahead to the restaurant and i will wait for my mom and then i�ll meet you there.
no, no, really.
you should go.
just go!
go!
go out!
really, the world is your oyster.
kick up the heels.
paint the town red.
(slang right?)
i�m serious.
c�mon, you should go.
here.
(shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) no, uh-uh, just go.
no!
no, you know what?
(closes the door) you [can�t get in there] (?
), the baby�s fine, now squam (?).
yeah, [i told you a|tell your] story walking.
(?)
oh, (door is locked) holy molly are we in a pickle now.
okay, well the ???
is not home.
oh-oh, wait, my mother is going to be here any minute.
and she has the keys.
i would, but i bruise like a peach.
besides, y�you know, everything is going to be fine.
the baby�s sleeping.
can�t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
rach you did not leave the water running.
please, just pull yourself together, okay?
you never cooked since 1996.
(actually rachel cooked in �609 - tow ross got high�, first aired 1999-11-25.)
oh my god, you know what, yeah, i think you�re right.
i think � listen, listen!
a pigeon, a pigeon.
(previously scared rachel turns away) no, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in.
landed on the stove and caught fire.
the baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird�s aid.
the eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon.
meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water.
baby and bird still up lays (?)
are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
great.
so let�s get going?
somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
i�m so sorry � and then rachel wasn�t sure she could leave the baby.
what?
thanks.
oh.
y�know this ???
is incredible.
okay, i�ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
rach, c�mon, emma is fine.
you�re turning into an obsessive mother.
okay, you need to stop.
(childish) huh-huh, they already know it.
w-oa � mommy!
(gestures to his not understanding mother) well, ???
think that�s us?
you know, i think that�s a good idea�our babysitter just pounded in another chardonnet.
(both get up) bye, y�guys.
halftime.
what?
um, monica and i are not supposed to play football.
it was soo not an accident.
she saw i was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face.
and just keep running.
whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown did not count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
oh yeah!
then how come you did not get the geller cup?
yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game.
but our dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.
anyway.
that is when our mom said we were not to play football ever again.
can i see you for a second?
all right, we are going to play.
here you go.
(throws her the ball) sweetie, do not worry you will get picked.
chandler.
sweetie, now i pick you.
okay.
all right.
so let us see, let us play from the trash can, to the lightpost.
right.
two hand touch, we will kick off.
oww!!
son of a...!!
ow!
come on!
come on, let us go!
yeah, losers talk!
yeah!
okay, (to chandler) this play, i want you to do a down and out to the right.
okay.
break!
you, you go long.
until we start to look very small.
break!!
one-mississippi, two-mississippi, switch!
switch!
switch!!
uh, hello, it is third down.
wow!
it just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
okay, it is second down.
(turns away) take all the second downs you need.
well, i said it loud.
chandler, i want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay.
and sweetie.. well ah, you want to just stay out there?
yeah.
okay.
hut!
hike!
uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed.
it does not count.
before the snap!
oh pheebs, that is great.
it does not count.
cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
oh-ho, okay.
ow!
ow!
okay, okay, fine, fine!
all right, you want to win by cheating, go ahead, all right.
phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
okay, first of all, i do not play with cheaters, and second of all, you know i had swollen glands!!
oh really!
why is that?
the geller cup.
okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
that cup is mine!
chandler!
chandler!
whoa!
whoa!
whoa!
what is with the tackling?
okay, you want to play rough, we can play rough.
hey, where did you get that?
it is no surprise that your winning, ‘because you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
what?!
the guys against the girls?
see, that is ridiculous monica, because I am only down by three touchdowns.
fine, fine, rachel your with monica, joey you are with me.
right.
okay, let us play.
let us go.
enough with geography for the insane, okay?
let us play some ball, guys.
okay, y'know what, let us just cut to the chase here.
okay?
heidi, which of my boys do you like?
yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill... save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay.
the clock is ticking.
we have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
hey!
it is 42-21!
let go!
let go!
no!
you let go!
how come it is always us left in the field holding the ball?
hey!
it is starting to snow.
give me the this!
hey, y’know what is weird?
after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you are going to have to say, "this is my brother-in-law ross."
not, "my friend ross," "brother-in-law ross."
that is weird is not it?
(disappointed) sure, do whatever you want.
yeah?
oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house.
oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…oh my god!!
i can not believe they-they did not even tell us!
(on phone) uh, hello dad!
monica and i just saw the house in the paper!
(listens) yes we are surprised!
(listens) who did you leave a message with?
i can not believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
man, some-some stranger’s going to be living in my room.
they kept your room for a while.
come on, you know they love you.
i was their first born!
they thought she was barren!
it is not my fault.
hey.
what is wrong with this year?
hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash?
some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
what?
dad?
(entering with monica) hey!
dad, we-we can not believe you are selling the house.
(to monica) let us grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
wow!
great!
(finds a pack of cigarettes.)
wait, dad who-who is cigarettes are these?
cool!
dad!
my report cards!
hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades) math, a. science, a. history, a. gym…(he puts it away and finds something else.)
oooh, my rock polisher!
it is a clown kit!
clown kit!
what?
how are you ever going to sell this place?
oh no.
dad!
dad!
what…(he goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.)
oh god…everything’s ruined!
dad, she is going to be crushed!
no!
dad that will not matter to her.
look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff!
see, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
well, can you blame her?
dad, dad i do not want to hear about it.
well, not right now.
okay look, monica came here for some memories and damnit, we are going to give her some!
okay, grab…grab some empty boxes.
okay?
we will-we will take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we will-we will put ‘them in their.
like uh y’know like this!
this!
(he picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.)
she-she could have made this!
right?
and this!
(he picks up a trophy) she-she could have won this!
sure!
ooh-ooh, what about this?
hey.
(overacting as well) yeah!
yeah!
(laughs.)
oh, this will make a great memory.
well, these.
these are yours right here.
(pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)
yeah.
yeah, oh you loved that thing.
you always had it with you.
you never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
nu-uh!
(grabs it and examines it.)
oh, i do not know how that got in there.
umm, your boxes are umm… dad?
all right.
i think it was a mouse.
(even more shocked) what?!!!
well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute!
i mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a porsche?!
well, what about me?!
I am a medical marvel!!
(entering) hey!
how come?
everybody else does.
oh, umm, I am just getting rid of a couple of things.
yes, yes it is!
no, but it is good it is—emily thinks we should get all new stuff.
stuff that is just ours, together.
y'know brand new.
touched.
used.
sat on.
sleep on.
look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, I am sure everything will be fine.
after what i did?
can you blame her?
(on the phone) no-no-no, it is just a bit sudden.
(listens) no, it is great.
okay?
I am totally on board.
i love you too, all righty.
bye.
(hangs up.)
nothing.
oh, actually, great news!
i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like I am moving to a new apartment.
woo-hoo!
well, her thought is, and i agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?
her cousin has this great place to sublet, it is got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other.
yes!
yes!
i mean it is-it is kind of far from work, but uh, y'know, I will get so much done on the commute.
i-I have been given the gift of time!
(on phone) i know i miss you too.
i can not wait to see you.
i love you.
bye.
(hangs up.)
no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
I am really going to miss this apartment.
y'know, ben-ben took his first steps right over there.
(points.)
i loved this place!
to tell you the truth, i wish i did not have to move.
well, i mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice… why?
what is going on?
unreasonable?
how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married!
you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work!
all right, it is about compromise!
do you always like it?
no!
do you do it?
yes!
because it is not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time!
it is real life, okay?
it is what grown-ups do!
(he storms out.)
yep.
y'know what?
I am really not in the mood.
look, this is hard enough!
i really need you guys right now.
okay.
thanks you guys.
pheebs are you wearing fur?
you do, huh?
what are you talking about?
wait!
wait!
wait!
y'know what?
just stay.
please?
it uh… it would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
hey!
hey, look!
ugly naked guy's back!
hey!
(listens.)
yeah-yeah, we are just having dinner.
(listens.)
uh, yeah, sure uh hold on.
(to the gang.)
she wants to say hi.
(to emily) hold on.
y'know what?
uh, rachel is here!
(rachel stops.)
yeah, yeah, she is here.
(on phone) hi.
(going onto the patio) look emily, I am just having dinner with my friends, okay?
emily that is ridiculous.
look, I am-I am moving for you, I am cutting friends out of my life for you.
please, just get on the plane and come to new york.
okay, you will see you are the only person i want to be with.
well, you can not know where i am all the time.
look, this marriage is never going to work if you do not trust me.
so, can you trust me?
well, i guess that is it.
my marriage is over.
yeah.
you can help me get my furniture back from gunther.
hey.
oh, oh, how did it go?
that is funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
what?
wh- hello?
the millners' farm in connecticut?
the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....oh my god, chi chi!
can i use.. either thumb?
easy.
what is this?!
hold on a second, alright?
just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
yeah, well, you did not know chi chi.
hey, pheebs.
...I will go.
let us start with the way he kept picking at- no, I am sorry, i can not do this, can not do this.
we loved him.
...what shoe?
...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
you know what i like most about him, though?
the way he makes me feel about myself.
well.. he was unbelievable.
he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first base-alan, second base-alan, third base-... what?
yeah, it is his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
a thumb?!
oh, now, do not listen to him, pheebs, i think it is endearing.
you know, there is nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
do not you realise what you are-you are doing to yourself?
if only he were a woman.
okay.
i think it is time to change somebody is nicotine patch.
(does so.)
(finishing changing chandler's nicotine patch) there y'go.
hey pheebs, you going to have the rest of that pop-tart?..
pheebs?
hey, i might!
is there somebody else?
who-who wants fair?
y'know, i just want things back.
y'know, the way they were.
hey hey, we will be fine.
we are just going to need a little time.
yeah.
he could row like a viking.
so how did it go?
you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
(she sits down and ross strokes her forehead.)
hey, you are not naked!
so hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
bye!
hey, i hope emma is not making it too hard on you.
yeah?
yeah, that will do it.
I am, I am okay.
sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out?
of course.
you know, I am disappointed, but it is not like it is a divorce.
no, it is not a divorce, it is not a divorce!
anyway, i think rachel and i need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
yeah, sure, why not?
in fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me... yeah?
any names come to mind?
excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar?
someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
well, if I am still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
nah, i do not know if i should.
i do not want to be drunk when i go home alone.
yeah, it is no big deal.
it is just a blind date.
no!
eh, if it was meant to be, it is meant to be.
wow, free crab cakes.
well, that is nice.
although i was hoping to have sex tonight.
just the crab cakes.
what is - what is going on?
what?
you - you are making money off my misery?
this is unbelievable.
i - i have never been so insulted in my life.
now, if you will wrap up my free crab cakes, I will be on my way.
hey, what is wrong?
oh.
crab cake?
well, what happened?
monica told me you had a blind date.
i did, too.
but is it technically a date if the other person does not show up?
why does everyone keep saying that?
that bad?
female body inspector?
what size is that?
the first date we have had in months, and they were both such disasters.
wait a minute; you do not think it was intentional?
i mean, that is just stupid.
i know.
a double blind date, and we both get stood up.
what are the chances?
emily's cousin kicked me out!
well, when you are subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
who needs a lease when it is family!
you got it.
thanks you guys, i really appreciate this.
all right, I am going to get packing again.
man, I have been moving around so much I am beginning to feel like a nomad.
what?
(entering from the bathroom) hey roomies!
oh, yeah i know, i know, it is a lot of boxes, but again i really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
oh, i uh, hope you do not mind, i kind of uh, jazzed it up a little.
check this out.
(he plays the greeting, and we will rock you starts to play and ross's voice comes over it.)
we will, we will, call you back!
pretty cool, huh?
(glaring at him) joey, please!
(motions to his computer.)
(entering) uh fellas, (does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which chandler returns as he closes the door.)
I will take sports.
all right.
uhh, international.
well, i guess i can check out those apartment listings, even though there is never anything in here.
(looks) oh yeah!
you are—hey, you are right!
here is an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it is available in five weeks!
oh, i-i do not know, it is kind of expensive for a studio.
okay, let us go.
oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, i was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier?
i mean after all, we all are using it.
oh my god!
(looking around, which does not take him long.)
i think this is it.
i do not know, maybe we should keep looking.
(to joey) so, you-you think i should go ahead and take this place?
(to chandler) how about you?
all right, i see what you guys are saying.
I will uh, I will go downstairs and fill out an application.
hey.
so i uh, i did not get that apartment.
some problem with my application.
yeah.
but, the good news is that phoebe said that i could stay at her place for a while.
so… look, you guys do not need me here taking up your space.
are you guys sure about this?
all right.
so I am a pimp huh?
it is okay!
look, i know that sometimes i can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me.
tell me if something is bothering you.
okay?
and for my part i will do everything i can to keep my annoying habits just (does the 'quiet down' maneuver).
(popping up behind joey wearing an indian headdress) come on, it is fun!
(following them into the kitchen) what are you guys doing?
look, would you guys grow up?
that is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
this is my son having lunch, ok?
it is going to happen a lot, so you would better get used to it.
now if you have any problem with it, if you are uncomfortable, just ask questions.
carol's fine with it, now come on.
carol?
(enters) hi, honey.
hello to the rest.
(to monica) so, uh, jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
it is a big deal to me.
this is great, monica.
i really appreciate this.
carol, we have been through this before, ok?
we have a good time.
we laugh, we play.
it is like we are father and son.
my mommies love me.
that is clever.
thanks aunt pheebs.
hey, you did not microwave that, did you, because it is breast milk, and you are not supposed to do that.
it is breast milk.
ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
no!
not even if carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
i did not freak out.
because it is breast milk.
it is gross.
no, no, carol.
there is nothing wrong with it.
i just, i just do not think breast milk is for adults.
(jumping away) that would be no.
(staring at susan) you have tasted it?
you have tasted it.
oh, you have tasted it.
(he rolls up his sleeve) give me the bottle.
(joey hands him the bottle and ross squirts some on his arm.)
give me the towel.
(joey gives him the towel and he wipes it off.)
(with a mouthful) that is not bad.
(crying) i hope you are a better father than you are a friend!!
(cries again and joey wakes up in horror.)
hey!
what?!
it is?!
(he tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs rachel’s belly.)
hey, when-when was it kicking?
what happened?
my god, the baby’s kicking.
that is great.
although i…kind of wish i-i would have been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.
look, i-i do not want to miss anymore baby stuff.
so…here.
here is my new pager number, okay?
anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it!
I will be there!
okay?
i do not care if it is three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
(rushes in) is everything okay?
your page said come to the hospital, what?
what was it?
what happened?
oh.
oh.
thank god, most women do not even feel them.
oh when you beeped me i was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
no i—mona!
what?
why?
what is wrong?
no really, you tell me what is up.
(to joey) so, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
yeah but still, i mean it should have been me.
I am the dad.
hey uh, i brought you some lunch.
well yeah!
what?!
what?!
rach what?!
i made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
(to rachel) i-I am sorry rach, i did not know.
are you going to be okay?
i can not believe this!
i should not be the one making her throw up!
yeah?
not to you, because you know this stuff.
i do not know any of it and I am the father.
i wish I would be more involved y’know.
yeah.
no i-i-i would love to be around for you and the baby.
and we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
so?
sure!
but it-it would not be anything romantic.
and I am-I am dating mona—damnit mona!
i was supposed to meet her like an hour ago!
what is wrong with me?!
no!
no it is not.
joey, this is a smart idea.
really?
oh rach that is great.
that is great.
(they hug and joey breathes a sigh of relief.)
real magic does exist.
ah, somebody is at the door on the ceiling.
hey chandler, there is a party tomorrow, you will feel better then.
oh, somebody is feeling better.
hi!
wow!
what, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
and he is, he is a total stranger?
huh.
sounds like mark something wants to have some sex.
well, I am just saying, i mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
hey, joey.
are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
thank you.
(to rachel) so did you ah, did you tell mark something about me?
uh-huh.
hi.
yeah.
so um, i-i heard about this ah, mark guy that ah, rachel met today.
oh yeah!
so ah, kind of pretty, pretty good.
he sounds like a nice, good guy.
that is excellent.
(to rachel) so, he is just a nice guy.
you really think this mark does not want anything in exchange for helping him?
yeah.
(to rachel) you see what men do!
do not tell me men are not nice!
(points to chandler) this is men!!
which one is gina?
that is okay.
hey, joey.
ah, which, which one?
mary-angela.
dear mary-angela.
hi.
how is it going.
this is the hardest letter I have ever had to write.
(to chandler) what the hell’s a matter with you?
how do you think joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
all right, look, look, you have got to do this yourself, okay in person.
at least you know her name.
you just go to the house and you ask for mary-angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
where in cuba?
bummer.
no, I am genuinely sorry the mark thing did not work out.
look, rach, i want only good things for you.
but, you, you do not want to seem too pushy.
(to rachel, as she gets his number) what, he gave you his home number?
as in like, to, to his home?
that is right good things, that-that is what i said.
(glances at monica) that is so made up!
there you go.
yeah well, if i know mark, and i think i do, I would expect nothing less.
high collar and baggy pants say I am a pro.
you go get ‘them.
(to monica) what did i do to you?
did i hurt you in some way?
‘why do not you call him?
!’ well, thank you very much!
y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
am i!
am i!
am i out of my mind!
am i losing my senses!!
this dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
no.
well, yeah!
(shyly) you grow up.
hi!
ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so i... (gives her a flower) hi.
(kisses her) how did did it go?
I am so proud of you.
listen, I am ah, I am sorry I have been so crazy and jealous and, it is just that i like you a lot, so... yeah.
congratu!!
(sees her hug mark) -lations-lations.
maybe he is just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
ah, we will all go.
(motions to chandler) come on.
(the guys leave) are you kidding?
(skeptical) that does not sound like you... that is monica talking!
she is putting words in your mouth!
hey!
hey, guess what joey has!
dude, i wanted him to guess.
guess where they are?
did i do something to you?
so?
he is right, man.
we are still going at the game, right?
yeah.
oh!
what a game, huh?
i can not believe chandler is missing this!
yeah, I would probably enjoy it more if you did not keep batting my hand away.
i know, i know!
when i was here for holidays on ice (joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) i was sitting so far away michelle kwan could not read my banner!
oh, but it is a kind game!
so we are a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let us stay just for one more goal.
one more fight!
okay.
forty-five minutes.
(handing him his coat) here!
you may want to lose the foam finger!
hey!
we are late too!
(rachel screams) so, nobody's here?
monica's going to kill us!
yeah, yeah, what is with the trophy!
you won an adult thanksgiving day spelling bee.
let me see this... (he takes the trophy from rachel's hands) grand supreme little darling, new york division.
you entered emma into a beauty pageant?
i can not believe this, she is our daughter!
that you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
so this is an annual thing?
yeah.
what are we going to do?
ooh, we will say that we were mugged!
you can not get mad at someone who is been mugged!
(to joey) hey!
i got mugged.
and they stole my pocket.
(sarcastic) that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around.
(reading the note) we know you are out there.
(rachel gasps) well, let us just go in there and face them.
what is that?
wha...?
oh sure, now they lock it, but when they are having sex on the couch, its like: "come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
come on you guys, we are sorry, alri...?
our subway broke down.
(to joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) for the love of god take it off!!
(takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor) how are we going to decide who gets this?
that is worse than no food.
i do not know... (staring back, and then breaks off) (to phoebe and rachel) yeah, he can do it!
i feel terrible.
really girls, not cool.
it is a day to be thankful.
yeah!
let us go out.
okay.
i gave them to joey.
(looking at joey's butt) I am finding it really hard not to mess with him.
nice!
I am just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
(entering) hey!
monica, uh dad called this morning and ah, aunt silvia passed away.
we were all pretty shaken up about it.
well ah, aunt silvia was, well not a nice person.
you get the dollhouse.
wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient indian burial ground?
that would never happen.
sure, what is up?
i-i know.
well if something comes up... (walks away) uh, pheebs, while we are hovering around the subject.
i just have to say dinosaurs, they-they do not go, rrroof!
hey, what is this?!
this is the coolest house ever!!
i would!
hi.
hi.
it is a little early to be drinkin’.
ohhhhh!
mon?
oh, fire!
there, there is a fire!
fire!!
sorry i ah, i scared you in there.
yeah.
well, we believe it originated here.
(he uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.)
in the aroma room.
no phoebe, do not look!
you do not want to see what is under there!!
hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes.
huh, what can we do in 17 minutes?
twice?
hey, uh, you can ignore that.
uhh, believe me when he is older, he will understand.
I will be right there.
(he goes over and opens the door to carol, susan, and ben.)
(to ben.)
hello!
(to carol.)
hello!
(to susan.)
hey.
uhh, emily, this is carol and susan.
look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so… oh come on!
that is-that is… true.
hey!
so uh, emily called last night… turns out them emily is just crazy about susan.
yeah, they are going to the theatre together!
they are going to dinner!
they are going horseback riding!
look, this is just a little too familiar, okay?
for like, for like six months before carol and i spilt up, all i heard was: "my friend susan is so smart.
my friend susan is so funny.
my friend susan is so great."
hey, they are going to the gym together!
two women!
stretching!
y’know they-they take a steam together!
things get a little playful—did not you see personal best?
how do you know?
i mean we thought carol was straight before i married her!
what a weird way to kick me when I am down.
oh.
what is wrong with ross?
actually that-that is not true, in the incredible hulk uh, no.
72, dr. bruce banner found… (sees everyone staring at him and stops.)
y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian.
(leaves.)
(opening the door.)
hey!
well, i asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "no."
i asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "no."
i asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "no."
so, he is sweeping.
(we see ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)
so umm, any word from susan?
uh-huh.
uh-huh.
uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, i do not know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
y’know, the kind of fun, you and susan had when we were married.
am i?!
am i?!
uh-huh, carol, so were we.
all right, just-just imagine for a moment, susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off.
y’know?
say-say they are coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they are laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… there is electricity, it is new.
it is exciting.
are you telling me there is not even the slightest possibility of something happening?
oh my god!!
i did not really believe it until you just said it!!
(returning from the phone.)
so, i just picked up a message from emily, she and susan are going to a poetry reading together!
so!
poetry?
susan’s gay!
they are being gay together!
oh, wake up!
excuse me?
look, i do not know what you are talking about, i am not a crazy, jealous person.
what?
it does not!
this is not fun!
well, i still think i was right about that whole mark thing.
nice luggage.
hi!
oh, i missed you too.
(to carol) no tongue.
(and gives her the thumbs up.)
yup!
you could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and i can find my way out of there like that!
(snaps fingers) (waves) hello!
was not this supposed to be just a fling, huh?
should not it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
...nauseous, I am physically nauseous.
what am i supposed to do, huh?
call immigration?
(pauses, looks suddenly inspired) i could call immigration!
hey, hello!
mmwa!
(kisses carol) i brought all the books, and monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
(pauses) I am pretty sure that it is... (making flinging gestures with hands) oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
oh, that is great, that is great!
(hugs and kisses carol.
then picks up a picture frame) hey, when did you and susan meet huey lewis?
(surprised, chuckling nervously) of course it is your friend tanya.
(looks up frightenedly) (chuckles nervously) the sex?
(chuckles) um, I am having enough trouble with the image of you and susan together, when you throw in tanya (miming washing hair, that is the best i could think of), yaw... oh, you know the sex of the baby?
oh, oh-oh-oh!
no, no, no, no, no, i do not want to know, absolutely not.
i think, you know, i think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!
(pauses) or is not... susan... yes, we did, everything's a-ok!
(flailing arms in protest) oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who does not want to know, standing right here!
ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
(interrupts) no, no, no i do not want to know, do not want to know.
ok, you know, i should probably, i should probably just go.
no problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses carol's stomach, then punches susan's shoulder) susan... (ross leaves.)
(on intercom) uh, never mind, i do not want to know.
(carol and susan laugh) wha, heh, how could you know, i do not even know!
wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and i do not know!
hi pheebs!
I am familiar with his work, yes... my god.
the actress!
thanks rach.
you have to tell her!
you have to tell her!
it is your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, i think it is a feminist issue!
guys?
guys?
(waiting for guys to chime in) sympathetic yet...) yeah, well... i think it is the most beautiful table I have ever seen.
(wiping his brow) ah...ooh!
well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
come on, two on one.
what, now?
(entering) how is it going?
paolo, i-i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say... (shuts door in his face and walks away) oh you guys, i-i really think just one of us should go out there so she is not overwhelmed... (pulls monica back) ...and i really think it should be me.
hey.
you all right?
come here.
(he hugs rachel) listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, i mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
what?
huh.
ohhhh (hugs her and sighs) see, rach, uh, see, i do not think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer.
i really do not.
i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a paolo.
(astonished) what?
i-I am, I am having a boy?
wha-I am having, I am having a boy!
(babbling) huh, am i having a boy?
I am having a boy!
oh, I am having a boy!
I am having a boy!
i-I am having a boy!
I am having a son.
um... (entering) hey!
has anyone seen my shirt?
it is a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
faded salmon color.
great!
great.
then i must have left it at mona’s.
i knew it!
that is my favorite shirt!
okay?
i love that shirt!
i do not know.
i mean i-i guess i could.
it is just that we did not really end things such good terms.
and if i go over there I would be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
(walks away.)
mona?
(there is no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is.
he reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key.
he looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain.
after dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter mona’s apartment.)
okay, if i were a salmon shirt, where would i be?
(he hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
hello!!
not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
(on phone) item j437-a, color: winterberry.
(there is a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone.
he answers it to mona.)
hi umm, listen come here, come in.
(she does so.)
I am so-so sorry about yesterday.
i-I am really sorry.
it is just that i… (he picks up the pink shirt.)
you do?
(faking starting to cry) oh god you are right.
(laughs) no.
(takes the shirt back.)
pffhah.
nothing, it is just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
hey, that guy did not hypnotise me!
okay.
here you go.
sorry.
(to remedy that, ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)
exactly, it will be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
and so now you guys are going to be married?
pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
pheebs, if you do not tell him, soon he is going to be married, and then you are going to hate yourself.
all we are saying is do not rush into anything.
yeah, he-he is right, he is right.
this is your time y'know, yeah, you are young, you are-you are weird, chicks dig that.
no the man’s right, that is what i had with rachel.
no, i ah, i slept with someone else.
it did not.
yeah, yeah.
do not ask me, i had it and i blew it!
oh, no!
no!
I am the ring bearer.
hi!
oh yeah, let me just finish this.
have you seen this?
it is a new alumni website for college!
it is cool!
you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you are up to.
it is actually kind of interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich?
uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident... no... i already e-mailed her.
you know what?
I am going to finish this later, ok?
let me just grab my coat.
(he picks up the ball) what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
(he enters another room) (he comes back) alright, let us go!
i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
(yelling at chandler) i have sex with dinosaurs??
that only is not funny, it is physically impossible!
ok?
depending on the species I would have to have a six foot long... (pause) it is not funny!!
i can not believe you put that on my alumni page!
you would better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today.
oh oh oh!
i respectfully disagree!!
(visibly upset) I am dead?
posting that i died?
that really is not funny.
oh please, hit by a blimp?
unbelievable, my classmates are going to think I am dead, my professors, my... my parents are going to get phone calls.
you are messing with people's feelings here.
you have really crossed the line here, but that is okay, it is ok because I am on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn.
that is right!
your coming out is about to get real graphic.
uhu uhu, check this out.
(chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen) eh..actually no, i do not need to because your little "ross is dead" joke did not work, ok, there were no responses.
nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you.
nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I am dead.
(silence) oh my god!
nobody cares that I am dead!?
what are you talking about?
you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet!
i did not get one response!
and I am dead!
i can not believe this.
not even my geology lab partner?
and i carried that guy!
(gets up from his sofa) you are right.
there is not a decent outlet.
exactly!!
(sits back down at his laptop and starts typing) no!
that would be stupid!
you are having it for me!
oh, too late, too late!
it is sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man... it is been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up!
i tell you, when i actually die some people are going to get seriously haunted!
ok, ok!
I am going to go hide!
oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
(he hides in the bedroom and closes the door) who is he?
i do not remember him, but then again i touched so many lives.
(they press their ears against the door) (coming in) I am dead and no one cares?
it is not ridiculous, look around!
no one's here!
yes, you are right.
still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i did not have an impact on anyone?
(sceptical) yeah... (he bounds into the lounge room) but you did not!
I am still alive!!
kori, i know this is a big surprise for you.
it is a long story but the things you just said really made my day!
i mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
did you hear that?
kori weston had a crush on me!!
(on the phone) no mum, I am not dead.
i know it is not something to kid about.
it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it is over, ok?
(pause) actually no, even if i had died, you would not be left childless.
(pause) monica?hey!
I am sorry I am late, did i miss anything?
15?
(joey nods again) your personal best!
(ross takes an oreo and joey mumbles, no!)
oh, on a date.
yeah, i met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and i sat near the door, so she would have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
she was totally at my mercy.
no, I am getting back down ‘because she lives in poughkeepsie.
she seems really great, but she is like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
oh, wow!
i should get going.
i-i got a date tonight.
you know that girl i told you about who lives up in poughkeepsie?
not her.
yeah, this is someone else i meet, and i-i can not decide between the two of them.
y’know the one from poughkeepsie, even though she is a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.
but this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
y’know she is, well she is-she is just as pretty, i guess she is smart, she is not fun.
well, i-i want to give her another chance, y’know?
she lives so close.
and, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny.
on the other hand, if she was not kidding, she is not fun, she is stupid, and kind of a racist.
hey!
i was not sleeping.
the one with the cat.
i got to go, I have got another date.
no, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke.
but it was a different joke than i thought—it was not that funny.
so I am still torn.
y’know, you are right.
thank you.
(waking up) what?
(notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him) what?
(now fully awake) are we really in montreal?!
coffee sounds great.
(they get up) wait, so, so you live in montreal?
how weird is that?
y’know?
you are moving in with me and have the one thing i do not have.
it is like uh, in a way you-you complete me (phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
(in an australian accent) you complete me kitchen, matey!
what?
oh…my…god!
i-i see what this is!
you are in love with rachel!
of course!
it all adds up!
i mean you you are obsessed with her.
it is always, "ross, what are you going to do about rachel?"
"ross, why-why are you moving in with rachel?"
"when are you going to confess your secret marriage to rachel?"
you want her!
(answering it) uh-oh, saved by the bell.
(on phone) hello?
(on phone) no-no-no, that is great!
I will be there monday.
and thank you again!
(listens) okay.
(hangs up) (to all) umm, that was the head of the paleontology department at n uh, y, uh you!
well remember that paper i had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh?
they loved it.
i know!
anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer!
i mean it is temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job.
how great would that look great on a mailbox, huh?
"professor geller."
(entering) hey everyone!
hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and i kind of wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) "there are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…" (continuing) "…subcategories.
the first of these subcategories is…" no!
why?
ohh!
okay!
okay.
(resumes reading word for word from the card) "there are three (pauses and looks at joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
(pauses and darts his eyes between chandler and rachel.)
(rachel starts laughing) each of these theories (glances at phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at chandler) into…" open with a joke?
it is a university, not a comedy club!
(gets up) okay!
thank you!
please do not say naked chicks.
i-i-i do not even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it.
y’know what?
I am just going to do it on my own with no naked chicks.
(entering) hello!
it went great!
and i did not need any jokes or naked chicks either!
i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself.
everyone is all, "ross you have to be funny and sexy."
well, i proved them wrong!
and now, I am going to pass the news onto joey and chandler.
that is right!
(to the class) right!
so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery!
what he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary.
imagine his consternation when—(sees monica and rachel.)
oh bloody hell.
look, i was nervous!
you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring!
i got up there and they were all like staring at me.
i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out.
will you-will you please?
oh.
(in his british accent) I am sorry, I have got plans with my sister.
(in accent) right, will you excuse us for one moment?
(takes monica aside.)
(in his normal voice.)
what are you doing?
just please stop!
(entering) look, i really need some help, okay?
why?
why did i have to speak in a british accent?!
what do i do?
they are not listening too me?
monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing?
(in his head) all right, keep going.
we are phasing the accent out, phasing it out.
so without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the british way) the team would never have identified (british) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (british).
were there any questions at this point?
(one student raises his hand.)
yes.
(points to him.)
(british) come again?
what is-what is this nonsense?
(giggles.)
(american.)
all right, I am-I am not english.
I am from long island.
i was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
I am sorry.
so, if we could just get back to the lecture.
umm, were there any questions?
(everyone raises their hands) about paleontology.
(they all put their hands down.)
all right, look i was just trying to make a good first impression.
obviously, i screwed up.
but what you guys think of me is really important because I am-I am hoping to get a permanent job here.
so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression… (in the accent again) well, hello rachel!
yeah!
yeah!
ok!
sure!
look!
can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
ok you...you really do not know what i am talking about?
ok!
last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
right that is why i came over to talk about.
hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony, why...why should i?
i mean if she wants to move on, that is fine!
no I am serious.
i mean she wants to date people?
fine!
i do not care but...at least she could have told me.
you know i do not know.
i mean i have plenty of opportunity.
just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
well, and how about this?
there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental not well.
i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
that is funny...do you think you will ever work again?
i can not believe rachel just moved on and did not say anything to me no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
no.
when he called, i...i threw the message away.
you know what?
enough!
enough talking!
i have to get moving!
hey check out those two blondes over there!
you do not have to do anything.
it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember?
you...you break the do not you have to be at work?
hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in europe?
here�s a question: "would you... hi!
i could help not notice, but that is an unusual necklace right, so that is a firm "no".
i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out.
this is great.
rachel's going to keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I am going to die alone.
i know!
(he stands) but, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
uh-ah!
(pfew).
good choice ross.
oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am.
oh, yeah, yeah that�s michelle.
oh, just this woman i�ve been seeing.
yeah, didn�t i mention that?
yeah, i mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this how great is this?
you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff.
oh, i am sorry michelle, that�s i told you about my daughter.
i told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
are you kidding?
we�ll see.
i don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
through the magic of sight!
i was here, putting our child to sleep... when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know, for what?
a week?
ok, michelle, it�s time to go.
ok. you know, if it�s meant to be, i�ll guess it.
bye, bye.
oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on oh, really!
oh, really!
what about the guy from the bar?
the guy you gave your number to.
because he called here looking for you.
so don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing, what?
because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket.
do you...do you not look there?
i never gave it to you.
i don�t know.
who am i?
i am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!
that�s not the point.
ok?
the point is you...you are the one uh, clearly.
yeah, maybe not.
so what you want to do?
hi!
I would love to!
phoebe, what happened?
oh, do not worry about it!
just use your travel insurance.
well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
uh, do not you think that would be a little weird?
i mean, two guys in a romantic inn... (browsing the brochure) i guess...it still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
(in a strange voice and eating candies) the big apple!
yeah, i ate all my gifts for everybody.
(high pitched voice) check again please!
not there.
(mumbling) she does not know what to say!
totally insane.
dude, let us drive home, we will hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they are closed maybe we will tap a tree and make some ourselves.
dude, do not worry 'bout it!
i know how we can make your money back!
this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those!
like those apples.
instead of taking one, I am... i take six!
c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we will make our money back in no time!
i think it is the sugar, could you hold the apple?
(on the phone) hi, this is ross geller in suite 206. it seems you forgot a couple of things.
could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?
(pause) thank you!
ok. toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and i feel like i am forgetting something... is there anything else you have that i have not asked for already?
(pause) yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
what did you get?
nice, put it with the others.
we are four short of a bush-of (pause).
god i feel so alive, i love being in the country!
oh, that is not cool.
no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you.
for example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.
(pause) now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) i wish I would thought this through.
not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
no, no, no, you can not take the remote control!
let us celebrate with some maple candy!
at least tell me where you hid it.
oh dude, do not worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car.
we are way ahead of the game.
oh my god.
there is something new in the bowl.
no, but i want...i want the pinecones!
it is not the same.
(to the receptionist) thank you for a delightful stay.
oh, my maple candy!
(sounds excited) hi you guys!
what is going on, you... you guys want to hang out...or...?
(looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
(entering) hey!
hey!
are you ready yet?
oh!
got ‘them right here, (pats his coat pocket) check!
yeah, cheerie-of!
well, we are all here!
i guess we should get going!
oh, I will-I will come hug you.
yeah.
(he does so and phoebe hugs him.)
thanks.
(to rachel) so, we are off.
thanks!
(they hug.)
ugh, i can not believe you are not going to be there!
so-so come!
why do not you come?
to london!
come to london.
please?
it will mean so much to me.
why-why can not you take a couple of days off?
this is my wedding.
fine.
you will-you will watch it on video when we get back.
all right, let us go!
bye, pheebs!
whoa-whoa-whoa!
emily, (gives her the time-out signal.)
honey, okay?
what?!
no!
no!
that is-that is time-out!
sweetie, you got to relax.
everything’s going to be great, okay?
come on.
come on.
um-hmm!
does not that sound delicious at the last minute?
yeah.
yeah.
yes, this place is beautiful.
emily’s parents got married here.
it is all right!
everything’s going to be all right.
uh-huh, i see that.
what?
what?
hey!
i just spoke to your dad, and you know what?
he seems to think we will be able to find a new place for the wedding.
whoa-whoa-what?
you found a place?
she said what?
postpone it?
emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
(he puts his pants on backwards.)
this is not right.
i can not ask people to do that?
would you ask people to do that?
(holds out his pants) the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option.
this is when we are getting married.
no.
I am saying it is now.
(he starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)
there is no ‘or’ in mind.
what is wrong with these pants?!!
(chasing her, trying to zip up his pants.
his got them on right now.)
no, wait!
emily!
no, wait, stop!
emily, please—(he catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
hi.
i understand you had a little talk with emily.
am i?!
and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
hey-hey, since you are the ‘fix-it’ lady, here is a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she does not want to have the wedding at all?
yeah.
i do not know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
excuse me?
i do not know.
a month?
i had no idea.
and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
come on.
you got to help me figure out what to do.
okay?
come on.
(they leave and chandler sticks his head out.)
okay?
but-but imagine a lot more lights, okay?
and-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles… but-but, if you do not love this, we will do it in any other place at any other time.
really, it is fine, whatever you want.
and, i do not know, if it starts to rain… (ross hugs his mom and dad)hi.
mom.
dad.
what is up, dad?
(holding him back.
)dad, dad, please.
look i do not want anything to upset emily tonight.
alright, she is had a hard enough couple of days as it is.
(picks up the bill.)
now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye.
now i might be able to get you the new lawn.
i go back there with lawn ornaments, he is going to laugh in my face.
look, were down to just one point.
could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
(screaming) I am getting married today!!
whoo-hoo!!
I am getting married, to..day!!
ahh, whoo-hoo!!
(he runs back out the door.
(using a slightly different inflection for each.)
i do.
i do.
i do.
(very nervous)really?
dad!!
(emily comes running in.)
nothing, nothing.
everything's under control.
(stepping in between them.)okay!
okay!
that is it!!
parents!!
parents!!
back away!!
all right, this is our wedding day!
from now on everyone gets along, and if i hear one more word.
no grandchildren!
(pointing at his mother.)
that is right!!
(sighing.)
it was...this disagreement over...(she sighs.
ross notices her in her wedding dress.)
my god.
you...you look beautiful.
you know what, i think we have had all the bad luck we are going to have.
(he hugs her.)
my god.
rachel!
(he walks towards her, grasps her hands and kisses her on the cheek.)
your here.
i can not believe it.
(she giggles.)
what happen?
why are you here?
i ross... take thee, rachel...(all his friends have looks of shock on their faces.
he realizes what he said.
quickly he says.)
emily.
(a slight chuckle.)
emily.
i think when someone steals your credit card, they have kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
marcel, stop humping the lamp!
stop humping!
now marcel, come back- (marcel runs toward rachel's room) come here, marcel- what?
it is, it is just a phase.
would you all relax?
it is not that big a deal.
what?
(mortified) hi.
at the vet.
she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase.
apparently he is reached sexual maturity.
she says as time goes on, he is going to start getting agressive and violent.
I am going to have to give him up.
i know.
i know.
i mean, one day, he is this little thing, and before you know it, he is this little thing i can not get off my leg.
no, no.
the vet says unless he is in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he is just going to get vicious.
I have just got to get him into a zoo.
well, we are applying to a lot of them.
naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right?
but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he is out of state.
uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that is a possibility.
what?!
are you insane?
this woman stole from you.
she stole.
she is a stealer.
yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
(reading letters) oh god.
(to marcel) we did not get into scranton.
(to the others) that was like our safety zoo.
they take like dogs and cows.
see?
i do not know who this is harder on, me or him.
marcel!
marcel!
marcel, no!
good boy.
see, how can nobody want him?
where exactly is your zoo?
yes.
no-no, he is, he is very docile.
well i, i do not know.
why?
he can hold a banana, if that is What are you mean... why- why- why would he need a blade?
he is in!
oh, did you hear that, marcel?
san diego.
san diego!
aww.
thank you, aunt phoebe.
just, just say what you feel.
that was good.
uh, if you guys do not mind, I would like to take a moment, just me and him.
marcel, c'mere, c'mere.
(he sits down and marcel jumps down and sits beside him) well buddy, this is it.
there is just a coupla things i want to say.
I am really going to miss you, and I am never going to forget about you.
you have been more than just a pet to me, you have been more like a be- (marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) okay, marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone?
could you just stop humping me for two seconds?!
marcel, would- okay, just take him away.
just take him.
guys?
there is a somebody I would like you to meet.
'that' would be marcel.
you want to say hi?
my friend bethel rescued him from some lab.
yeah.
i mean, it is been kind of quiet since carol left, so... nah, i dunno... i think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kind of pathe- (realises) ....sorry, that is, that is 'pathet', which is sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
how could you not get it?
you were santa last year.
come here, marcel.
sit here.
(marcel wanders off) just a smidge.
c'mon, this was a pact!
this was your pact!
okay, look, he is not going to hurt them, right?
i did not want to leave him alone.
alright?
we- we had our first fight this morning.
i think it has to do with my working late.
i said some things that i did not mean, and he- he threw some faeces... oh, that would be great!
okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you are there to see him, okay, and you are not like doing it as a favour to me.
so tell me something.
what does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
four.
five.
(buries his head in his hands) okay, so I am going to be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
hey, y'know, this is so not what i needed right now.
oh, it is-it is marcel.
he keeps shutting me out, y'know?
he is walking around all the time dragging his hands... really.
what, uh... what juggling thing?
no.
par-tay!
'that thing'?
this is how you greet guests at a party?
let me ask you something, if i showed up here with my new girlfriend, she would not be welcome in your home?
okay.
he was more embarrassed about that than anyone.
okay?
and for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened... thank you.
(she walks off) c'mon, marcel, whaddya say you and i do a little mingling?
(marcel runs off) alright, I will, uh... catch up with you later.
(watching marcel play with phoebe.
to chandler) look at him.
I am not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
perfect.
perfect.
so now everybody's getting kissed but me.
(watching marcel and talking to rachel) i wanted this to work so much.
i mean I am still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he is just phoning it in.
just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much does not love you back.
ohhhh… it was not the best.
well, the lighting was okay.
oh great!
that means I am stuck with, "so, we were watching you in there (points to the tv) and you were sittin’ right here!
whoa!"
(entering) hey!
oh, nothing much.
just trying to figure out what I am going to do for dinner.
(notices the table) hey—ooh!
what is-what is that, dinner stuff?
you making dinner?
what you got over there?
tacos?
uhh, those are tacos.
eh, either way I will pass.
(quietly to chandler) i still can not eat those.
(monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.)
what is so funny?!
(to chandler) you told her!
(to monica) look, okay-okay i had food poisoning!
it is not like i choose to do it!
it is not like—it is not like i said, "umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
(to chandler) how could you tell her?!
oh really?
well i-i guess monica should know about atlantic city.
well, chandler and i are in a bar… and this girl is making eyes at chandler, okay?
so after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing.
now, i know what you are thinking, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you are right, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
oh mon, i laughed so hard… whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
all right!
all right!
chandler entered a vanilla ice look-a-like contest and won!
oh, is that funny?!
oh, you-you find that funny?!
well maybe chandler should know some of your secrets too!
once monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she would made.
monica could not tell time ‘til she was 13!
ohh!
ohh!
in college, chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
and in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
and!
we should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
okay, (gets up) if you will excuse me, i-I am going to go hang out with some people who do not know the space mountain story.
man!
(monica mouths, "I am sorry.")
(entering) hey, you guys... i have great news.
oh, well, er, i already ate, but sure...!
(they all look at each other when ross grabs a plate) guess what happened at work today... try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... my tenure review board met today and i hear it is looking really good.
yeah.
do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh?
i am going to get laid.
no, no.
i-I am good.
I am up for tenure.
you too!
what are the odds?
hey!
wha-hoo!
what is this?
(showing the bottle) well it is a, it is a bottle of champagne.
why is this here?
i guess it is here because i got tenure!
this is the single greatest day of my professional career.
gunther, six glasses!
oh, i thought joey was here.
five is good.
(gunther leaves, hurt) well, I am going to have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
i got tenure.
i did not win the lottery... hey rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
oh, you know what?
you are going to get it.
i-i-i-i can feel it.
and-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
but also knowing it means a lot.
...that center around work.
you know what the best part about this is?
i can never be fired.
no seriously.
i have job security for life.
you know, i never have to worry.
(rachel starts crying) oh, look at you.
look how happy you are for me.
rach, I am so sorry.
great.
i feel like an idiot.
oh... (to the others) little heads-up would have been nice.
(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed.
he finally manages) (sarcastic) I am sorry, it is almost as if this was not built for a quick getaway!
uh, you know, you can not always get a seat on the subway, so... (laughs stupidly) yeah!
yeah, i got tenure!
(mark looks at him strangely and walks off) see?
i told you something good would come along.
and he seemed really nice.
I have met him before?
(realizing) that is mark?
i hate that guy.
no, no, no, you cannot go to dinner with him.
oh yeah, I am sure he is going to give you a job.
maybe make you his sexretary.
I am serious.
i just do not trust that guy, okay?
hey, is rachel here?
she is still at dinner?
that guy mark.
from bloomingdale's... she thinks he is just being nice to her.
but i know he really wants to sleep with her.
we ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her.
but i know he just wants to get into her pants.
hey, so uhm... how was dinner?
(speaking without pause, agitated) oh yeah?
yeah?
i wonder why?
what could that smarmy letch possibly want?
should we send something?
congratulations!
can we, can we just stop for a second?
who said something better would come along, huh?
you did not believe me.
i told you everything was going to work out.
(gasps) you know what?
this calls for a bottle of israels finest.
i have to say tupolo honey by van morrison.
hey mon!
nope.
yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
getting it away from me would be job one.
you need to get some sleep.
well I am thinking that chandler's our friend and janice makes him happy, so i say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
hmm?
nooo, i had to return it to the costume place.
i think i have an old band uniform from high school.
yeah.
what?
no.
nope.
what?
okay, umm.
did you ever see, um, return of the jedi?
do you remember the scene with, um, jabba the hut?
well jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, princess leia.
princess leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing.
it was pretty cool.
(entering with monica in tow) hey!
look who i found standing outside of the szechwan dragon staring at a parking meter.
okay.
hi.
guess what?
they published my paper.
how could you have told her?
oh, she did not think it would be that big of deal.
look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
that is different, okay.
that is like, uh 'who dated a stripper?'
or 'who did it on the back of the staton island ferry?'.
yeah.
look, you do not, you do not talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
noo!
hmph.
so what you, you tell each other everything?
did you talk about the night of five times?
do you tell people about the night of five times?
i know, but it is still worth mentioning, i think.
women tell each other everything.
did you know that?
no chandler, everything!
like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth.... rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it.
do you want to?
nooo!
yeah?
okay, okay, I will go first.
so, uh, the other night rachel and i are in bed talking about fantasies, and i happened to describe a particular star wars thing.... yes!
yes!
wow, well, that-that was easy.
okay, you-you go.
okay.
hmph.
with the belly-button ring?
oh, muhawa!
your mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your mom, what is the matter with you?
i said 'share' not 'scare'.
go sit over there!
(chandler goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
no, no it is, um, it is not you, um, it is um, it is (turns and sees his mom standing where rachel is) i hate chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
(rachel starts looking around and down, with a 'what the hell is going on?'
look on her face.)
well, is this hillary your hot assistant chef hillary?
the one that always stares at me when i come in?
still i could tell.
she was into me.
(joey rolls his eyes.)
well, why do not you set us up?
maybe it is a universal thing?
hey guys.
what is up?
(he smiles.
his teeth are freakishly white.)
i whitened them.
yeah.
what do you think.
come on, seriously.
ahh, i-i did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
a-a day.
i know.
that is why i did it.
(with a big smile) come on, are they really that bad?
oh, hey, hey rach, do you notice anything..ahh… i do not know what I am going to do.
that date starts in like an hour.
oh great.
so all i need to do is get some new skin.
thank you.
whoa.
whoa.
whoa.
we are not 13 anymore.
but, will not she notice i have makeup on?
what??
no.
i am not putting on makeup.
(knock at the door.
phoebe enters.)
mmm-hmm.
mmm.
mm-hmm.
(chuckling) hmm-hmm.
mmm-unmm.
hmm-hmm-hmm.
(putting his hand up to block his mouth.)
okay.
i, uh, am from long island.
i-i came to the city for college.
um, i, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time i like to read spy novels.
but, but, let us talk more about you.
hmm.
mmm.
(giggling) hmm-hmm-hmm.
(picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.)
me, neither.
I have had a really good time too, you know.
(putting the bread down.)
(putting the bread up to his nose.)
ohh, i just like the smell.
(sniffing it.)
mmmm.
hmm-hmm.
mmm-hmm.
(picking up their wine glasses.)
(covering his mouth with the glass.)
how about all the way.
(looking at the posters.)
wow, cool poster.
or should i say groovy poster?
(they sit down on the couch.
ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.)
so, ahh, where were we?
ohh, you can see them, huh?
i-i, did that for you.
what is a matter with me?
you have got a black light.
it is 1999!
(entering) hey, you guys!
guess who is up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?
yeah, right!
what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and charlie laugh, then joey starts laughing too without any reason) well, why are you laughing?
professor sherman, yeah.
I have a meeting with him today.
yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him.
tsz... no!
(he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
wait a minute, you guys.
oh, i want to ask you something.
i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, I would love for you guys to come and hear me.
it is in barbados.
so-so what did the doctor say?
how do you feel about all this?
(puzzled) what?
(looking astonished) what?
no!
i am not going to give them ben!
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
(reading from a notepad) i mean, we have been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they are off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash.
(he throws the notepad in the waste bin) so-so what i am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge!
i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles!
oh, that is not what you want... joey!
hey, i need to talk to charlie.
is she there?
I am meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker... it could be better!
he, uhm... he fell asleep!
barbados.
what am i supposed to do?
he is out cold!
in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder.
i can not!
if he realizes that I am the one that put him to sleep, i will not get the job!
(to the still half asleep professor) oh my god!
you really want me to be the keynote speaker?
thank you!
(hugs him whilst still on his lap) who is chip?
the guy who took rachel to the prom?
why is he calling you?
monica, you are so lucky!
he is like the most popular guy in school!!
(to rachel) i was just leaving.
why?
did you write it?
well ah, actually... well, umm, why do not you give him a call?
oh, I am sure.
(whispering in her ear) oh, that is right!
he called to ask out monica!
that-that is got to be embarrassing!
(reading the newspaper) hey, here is a question; where did you guys get the finest oak east of the mississippi?
I am reading your ad.
yeah.
good, so do i are you sure she is in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
so pheebs, how long is your mom going to be with us?
so, guys, am i crazy, or does phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?
come on, you-you can not tell me you actually believe that-that there is a woman inside that cat!
no you do not.
no you do—y'know what, you are not going to suck me into this.
i do not always have to be—okay, okay.
(starts to leave) (taking the flyer) apparently phoebe’s mother also goes by the name julio.
yes, we have to tell her!
(holds up a hand) little girl misses her cat.
(hold up the other hand) crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
(gets up) okay, y'know what, i have to go have dinner with my son, can i trust that when you see phoebe, you will tell her.
thank you.
(entering) hey!
so ah, what did the insurance company say?
(seeing phoebe still with cat) you did not tell her?!
(they all kind of shy away.)
okay, fine!
pheebs?
hi!
listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl.
there are flyers all over the place.
no!
no!
look—hey, enough is enough!
look, i am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom.
this is a cat!
okay, julio the cat!
not mom!
cat!
none.
I am sorry.
i do not know what to say.
(goes over to julio) come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) mrs. buffay.
sorry, about what i said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat.
when clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.
oh!
y'know, I have got an extra futon.
really?
which one?
things you find in the ocean, (to joey) you are going to be on "pyramid"!!
except for "match game"... oh, and chandler and i have this stupid college alumni thing.
i can not believe you get to meet donny osmond.
(very excited) yeah-uh!
(singing) "...and I am a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
so weird to see all these people again... oh my god, look, there is geoffrey cleric.
he was roommates with john rosoff.
he went out with andrea tamburino.
she dumped him for michael skloff.
hey, there is missy goldberg.
you got to remember her.
dude.
you are married to my sister.
hey, i hear she is single again, d'you think i should ask her out?
yes please.
hey.
hey, check out the flyers for the band.
i made  them on a macintosh in the computer room!
thanks to a little something called "helvetica bold 24 point"!
hey, missy... yeah, yeah.
you should come check us out.
we are called "way!
no way!".
boss!
she is gone.
dude, i was going to ask her out.
well, i thought it first, holmes.
woha!
wait... what are we doing?
what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl.
i mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
me too.
I am good at it.
you got it.
those are the pacts!
oh, oh... maybe not you!
thank you.
(they shake hands) all right, here i go.
hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
i know, and i can not stop sweating.
(he walks towards missy) so, saturday night!
great!
oh, well, uh, this is going to sound kind of silly, but, do you remember my roommate chandler bing?
it is been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
that is ok. uh, anyway, well he and i both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we did not want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kind of made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
yeah, why?
you did?
(angrily) and on my turf?
(to chandler) you made out with missy goldberg.
how could you do that, after you promised me?
you broke the pact!
that does not matter!
we are talking about the foundation of our friendship.
i did not.
no.
no!
i never did anything with adrienne turner.
i do not know what... you are talking about.
listen adrienne, you can not tell chandler about this.
cool!
(they start kissing again and chandler looks shocked) i did not know you knew about that.
(looks disappointed in himself) man... i...
I am sorry.
so, eh.
i made out with adrienne and you made out with missy.
well i guess we are even.
we are even, right?
(thinks about it for a few seconds) what did you do to my mom?
hey, where is rachel?
did you know chandler kissed rachel?
nineteen eighty seven.
the weekend you guys visited me at school.
well, it matters to me.
because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time.
okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right.
she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats.
well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know.
but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips.
i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back.
it was only for a second, but... it was amazing.
and now, now i find out that you kissed her first.
mine.
no, she was definitely on my bed.
well, then who was on my bed?
(realizing) no!
no, no!
you were under the pile of coats?
oh my god!
you were my first kiss with rachel?
i had a dream last night where i was playing football with my kid.
no, no, with him.
(he mimes holding the baby like a football.)
I am on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and i, i know I have got to do something because the tampa bay defence is comin' right at me.
right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I am thinkin' they can take us.
and so i uh, hah-hah, i just heave it down field.
anyway, suddenly I am down field, and i realise that I am the one who is supposed to catch him, right?
only i know there is no way I am going to get there in time, so i am running, and running, and that, that is when i woke up.
see i, i am so not ready to be a father.
wo-wo-whoa.
what about phoebe's birthday?
tonight.
you take your time.
what the hell are you doing?
you scared the crap outta me.
yeah, yeah.
i got a lemon schmush.
(still annoyed) yeah, we will just use our special cake tools.
oh, we just... dad, before i was born, did you freak out at all?
dad, dad, dad, I am talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing.
did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "oh my god I am going to be a father" kind of a thing?
no, no, dad, i was just wondering.
thanks, dad, really, i ju... you know, i just, i just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
no, we can go to williamsburg.
good.
maybe he can switch it back.
maybe not.
well did you try calling her?
uh-huh.
do you have a point?
it is just a fur ball.
yours, i just got 43 points for 'kidney'.
i had a 'k'.
where is where is my 'k'?
you have got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'k'!
no, no you do not understand the animal hospital is way across town he is choking i do not know what else to do.
lady, he is people.
he has a name, okay?
he watches jeopardy!
he he touches himself when nobody's watching.
please, please have a heart!
he looks so tiny.
yeah.
the doctor got the 'k' out.
he also found an 'm' and an 'of.
well, the doctor says he is going to be fine, he is just sleeping now.
no, why?
(quietly) hey, fella!
how you doing?
aqui est�.
(here it is!)
�lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele!
(the thing is, he doesn`t like the program!)
hey!
come on, she is going to love you guys!
(entering) hey!
hey you guys, i need some fashion advice.
(he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) how does this look?
c'mon!
this looks good!
damnit!
i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool!
really?
that would be great.
i mean, i have to do something, she kind of teased me about how i dress.
you are wearing the same shirt.
you know, we should just go, I am not going to find anything here!
this stuff is ridiculous!
rach, come on, I am not going to wear any of this!
(he picks up a shirt) nothing silver.
(rachel sighs).
ok?
nothing with hair!
(rachel sighs again) and nothing with padlocks on it!
(rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
(feeling the fabric) wow, this is really soft (he looks the price).
three hundred and fifty dollars?
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
wow!
actually this looks like pretty good!
yeah!
(he turns and watches his back and there is a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) boys will be boys?
all right, that is it, I am getting out of here.
uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
really?
so, you are saying, uh, if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers?
(to joey) so?
what do you think?
(shows himself - joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
(not getting it) yeah!
yeah!
rachel picked it out for me.
she told me to trust her and you know what?
I am glad i did!
i turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
you are just jealous because you could not pull this off.
yeah, now if you will excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) i have a date.
(as he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) see?
(to joey) all eyes on me!
oh!
you are going to love it!
(the girl is looking in the other direction as ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I am so glad, we are finally doing this.
here (gets behind her to help.
when the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt ross is wearing.
they look at each other, shocked.
they abruptly put their coat back on) so this was fun!
(they leave the room and head into opposite directions) turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
because it is soft... hey, so how was your date?
well, looks like it is just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
uh-huh, that is why they call it staten island.
(he catches the ball and pauses, staring at joey in disbelief) also an island.
(looks at his watch) 2:17. are you serious?!
wow!
we are pretty good at this!
hey!
we totally forgot about lunch!
you bought shawn cassidy!
what-what is it?!
why is it inside out?!
how much did you pay for that?
yeah?
how much?
on a cat??!!!!
free cats do that too, y'know.
{which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter.
pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably will not die on you in a week and a half.
if you want a leash, go to the pet shop.
if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it is life.
now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
(to joey) hey, you want to get something to eat or uh, do you want to see how long we can throw this ball back and forth?
huh?
yeah?
uhh, yeah it would!
let us do it!
what?
i know!
(looks at the ball in his hands.)
do not switch hands, okay?
…now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws!
how did it get there?!
how do you know?
you do not have a watch.
monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
2 hours, 27 minutes.
hey rach!
check it out!
almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
yeah.
does not sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
(catching the ball) monica!
stop throwing it so hard!
we are on the same team!
it is really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
all right.
(he gently tosses the ball to chandler who catches it.)
baking it did not help, huh?
I am starving!
I am still hungry!
i am!
oh, thank god!
i know.
my arm is killing me.
(sits down at the table) oh, eh, just thinking about emily getting married tomorrow.
(joey panics.)
(turning and looking) what?
where?
what am i looking at?
me too!
ross has the blender!
ugh, everything's just falling apart!
(to gary) that was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
(to gary) he told you everything!
i mean you totally cracked him!
oh hey, gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
it is the—chandler!!
so where are we going next?
yeah, no one talks like that!
hey, I am more cop than you two!
hello!
I am in the front seat, okay?
I am gary's partner!
umm, jealous!
(he drops the cherry and it turns on.)
yeah, no problem.
(tries to turn it off.)
sorry!
sorry!
oh, (he sticks it under his shirt) there!
(it is just there flashing through his shirt) hey gary, who am i?
phone home!
what is it?
what?
what?
what?
what is it?
uh-huh.
thank joey!
(on the machine) hey ross!
it is you!
i just want you to remember this feeling.
you are lucky to be alive!
so live everyday to the fullest.
love yourself, okay?
okay.
oh, and also get stamps.
bye!
(he hangs up.)
pheebs, we had the most incredible night!
okay, so, we are in the car… okay, okay, so we are in the car.
right?
and bang!
a shot was fired.
and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
yeah, but-but he did not know that!
and it could have just as easily have been a bullet.
wow!
i could have died tonight.
i do have a newfound respect for life.
rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
y'know, it-it does not matter.
the important thing is that you are here.
you are my friend, and you are here.
oh!
(he goes over and hugs her.)
the most amazing thing happened tonight.
i thought my number was up.
i had an actual near death experience!
okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right?
and somebody took a shot at me!
no, a car backfired, but (rachel suddenly calms down) i thought somebody was taking a shot at me.
and rach, i…i survived!
and i was filled with this-this great respect for life.
y'know?
i-i want to experience every moment.
i want to seize every opportunity.
i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
(stares at her briefly) okay, why are you here?
you talked to her?
well, okay, what-what did she say?
wow!
huh?
yeah!
yes, of course!
right.
i guess, i guess i should call emily.
okay, look, yesterday i would have even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience.
i mean, that-that has got to mean something!
you were not there!
okay, maybe this is something that i-I am supposed to seize!
y'know?
huh.
that does make sense.
because i do want to seize some opportunity, but i-i really do not want to see or talk to her.
yeah.
maybe today is just, close call day.
hey, thanks rach.
(they hug.)
oh wait-wait-wait!
the message is blinking.
maybe you did not erase it.
(on machine) "hey ross, it is you!"
(hits the stop button) oh yeah, no that is-that is an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
(looking at the coffee table where his money was) hey umm, was-was monica here?
yeah, i want my money back.
hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real?
i wonder how i would react under fire, y'know?
and not backfire but-but heavy fire, like i was in a war or something.
i know where joey would be.
he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
…and it was ernst muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the velociraptor would expand it is collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it is predator.
(a student raises his hand.)
yes mr. lewis?
just a high pitched intimidating noise.
well we-we do not know for sure.
but in my head it-it sounded something like this.
(he makes a high pitched noise and alan does not know what to make of it.)
of course, this is just conjecture.
okay, that is uh, that is all for today.
(everyone starts to get up.)
uh mr. morse, can i see you for a moment?
mr. morse i need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I am afraid i-i had to fail you.
well you need 60% to pass… seven.
no-no it is not.
what-what happened there ned?
well I am sorry but, that-that is really not my problem.
well that brings me in the loop a little.
okay!
(walks away from him.)
umm, i uh, I am your teacher.
I am sorry, you are-you are a student and i-and i like women.
in spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
can i ask you something?
have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
there is this kid in my class who said he is in love with me.
i do-i do not have a boyfriend.
there is a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
yeah!
i do not know.
i mean, last year elizabeth now-now this kid.
what-what-what-what is it?!
am i giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe?
(rachel and joey both look at him.)
it-it—the point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
yeah.
i guess i can cut him some slack.
(turning towards him) yes mr. lewis, how can i help you?
and why exactly would i do that?
(goes back to writing on the board.)
(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) what?!
no!
well that is different!
okay?
because he, he was actually in love with me!
what?
i can not believe someone would do that for a grade.
uh mr. morse, can i speak to you for a moment?
uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it?
do-do you looove it?
i just want you to know that I am changing your grade back.
‘because i know what you are trying to pull here.
okay?
it is not going to work.
y’know what?
i-I am not even going to talk about this.
okay?
this little thing is over.
i know you have a girlfriend!
okay—(ned looks shocked)—yeah!
and i know about the other professors!
how do you think that makes me feel ned?!
you used me!
you do not love me and you never did!
(ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.)
ah professor winston, professor fredrickson, I will be right with you.
(to ned) do not make this worse and I will give you a c. (to the professors) shall we?
(they leave.)
hey, how did the date go with mr. millionaire?
still?!
i guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
(entering) hello.
so rachel called.
wants to see me.
going over in a minute.
well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
then be supportive like a guy.
hi.
you ah, wanted to see me?
what?!
what are you doing?
are you trying to hurt me?
or something?
yes.
yes, i do.
yeah, i-i really do.
(takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) hey!
this-this was a gift?!
it is still a gift!
i got it from the gift shop!
no!!
y'know-y'know do not do me any favours.
in fact, where, where is the rest of my stuff?!
huh?
like-like my umm, (picks up a book) hey, this book is mine!!
and-and-and, and that t-shirt you sleep in?
I would like that back too.
yes, i do.
I am just trying to help you, move on.
petty... petty... petty... small... (rachel comes back into the living room and catches ross mocking her.)
awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
I am-I am going to wear this all the time!
i love this shirt!!
(he kisses the shirt) oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah... oh-oh, okay, okay!
(he quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the t-shirt.
it is an old ‘frankie says relax’ t-shirt, that barely fits him.
rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.)
if you do not mind I am going to the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt.
(starts to leave) you have a pleasant evening.
(he exits and leaves the door open.)
you bug me.
i knew it!
i knew it!
i always knew she liked him!
y'know, she would say no, but here we are!
right?
we just broke up, first thing she does!
hey, it is been like three weeks!
here they come, here they come.
oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I am going to kill myself, i swear.
i can not, i can not watch this.
(turns away, then quickly turns to look again) come on, date over!
date over!
uh-oh, here we go, she is going in.
she is going in.
wait!
he is going in!
he is going in!!
the door’s closed!
i, i can not see anything but the door closed!!
okay, i have to do something.
i mean, i have, i have to stop it!
i do not know, but i ah, i have the feeling that my being there will do it.
I will go over and i will borrow something.
juice!!
i need juice!!
look, they must be stopped!
i need juice!
people need juice!!
people need juice!
juice, i need... yeah, okay.
it is just i miss her so much.
oh perfect, we were just going to see if you wanted to go.
how rude.
hi!
great to see you!
how you doing?
okay!
you take care!
hey pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and chandler blowing us off before?
phoebe, why did you do it?
what?!
why?!
i can not think of anything.
wait a minute, is it because joey and i did not invite him to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
i guess it could.
well, if he is angry, he really should not just cover it up.
i-i wish he would just tell me the truth.
hey, remember how chandler and phoebe blew us off yesterday?
remember?
you-you were eating pizza.
okay.
well, apparently chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
yeah!
anyway, i-i still think we should try to patch things up, y’know?
like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another knicks game and invite him.
oh.
(starts to get his money) all the time?
hey!
so uh, was he excited about the tickets?
what?!
i can not believe it.
(pause) can i tell you something?
I am a little mad at him now.
y’know what?
he did not want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we do not talk to him at all!
that is right!
eh?
we will show him!
wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
so you two are really serious?!
you-you are going to get married?!
i mean… we are going to be brothers-in-law!
(they hug.)
hey-hey pheebs!
chandler’s going to ask monica to marry him!
you told her before you told us?
hey, you are not going to believe this.
i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy.
they printed it!
yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.
it is not just about the pictures.
(showing them the page) here, check it out.
it is the first one, too.
what?
uh, oh-oh, no you did not.
i did.
hey, tell dan, ‘thanks.’ what?
look, chandler, it is my joke.
but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they do not print the name, so it does not really matter who gets credit, right?
no, it is my joke, it is mine.
you can call them, they will tell you.
it is my joke.
you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard.
what, you did not get it?
the doctor is a monkey.
your joke?
well, i think ‘the hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think I will show the sexy teller that i am a published writer.
oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
well, I am not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
(showing the playboy magazine to gunther) oh, hey, gunther, check this out.
uh, yeah, I will take a coffee.
thanks, man.
yeah, why would it be weird?
hey, joey, can i get some coffee?
seriously, i-i asked you before and you still have not gotten it.
joey, seriously, can i get my coffee?
it is my joke.
y’know, i do not think we are going to settle this.
yeah!
hey mon.
monica!
(she appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
yeah.
yeah, but I am your brother.
we are family.
that is the most important thing in the world.
we will each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.
see, i would never snap at you like that.
are you kidding?
okay, look.
i-i studied evolution.
remember, evolution?
monkey into man?
plus, I am a doctor, and i had a monkey.
I am doctor monkey!
it is your joke.
no way.
joey, you should not lie on your résumé.
(whispering) it was ok... (he enters) hey.
you guys know where rachel is?
so unbelievable.
she was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with emma.
(he tries to take a cookie but monica slaps his hand) hey!
what?
she is going to eat all those cookies?
so, why is erica coming to visit?
(looking at rachel entering with emma) oh, hi!
hi!
thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
no, no, no, I am sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at barney's?
oh my god.
is-is he ok?
ok, ok.
I am going to come out to long island with you, i mean, you can not be alone right now.
still-still, let me come... for me.
i bet someone could use one of monica's freshly baked cookies.
oh!
and I am doctor ross geller.
rach, i think I am going to wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, i do not want to infect him.
I am not scared of him, I am really sick!
I am feeling better.
he is unconscious, i think we will be just fine!
did the tv wake you?
ouchy.
well, i came with rachel, who should be back any second!
(pause) so what is new?
right, is it painful?
nope, just the one.
rach!
hey!
i was going to make us some dinner but all i found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.
(pause) i think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
oh, yeah.
emma's doing great.
wow.
just can not believe I am in rachel green's room.
yeah, sure, right!
like I have ever been in rachel green's room.
sorry.
(rachel sits on her bed).
you ok?
you had a rough day, uh?
but we do!
(pause) it is going to be ok, rach!
what?
no, no!
hey, hey, hey look... they gave him a lot of medication, ok?
he would not even know if you were there.
look, we will go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
no, god!
hey, rach, you have been an amazing daughter, ok?
right now you just need to get some rest.
(he kisses her on her forehead) good night.
sure!
oh, of course... me too.
come here.
(they hug) ok, well, uh, i can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(there is one of those moments.
they are staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.)
oh, oh.
(he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed).
no, rach!
I am sorry, i just do not think this, this, this is a good idea.
no, look, uh.
you are upset about your father and you are feeling vulnerable and i just do not feel it would be right, I would feel like I would be, you know, taking advantage of you.
look, I am sure it would be great, but i-i think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I am going to go!
I will see you in the morning (he leaves).
(outside her room, talking by himself) have not had sex in four months, i should get a medal for that!
hey rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
you have been quiet all morning.
is everything okay?
you sure you are alright?
(knowing she is not alright) of-kay.
well, I am going to go grab us some breakfast.
(he starts to leave) (knew this was coming) there it is... (he comes back) (half amused) wait, wait, (looks around a little) you are mad at me about last night?
i was just trying to do the right thing.
(acknowledging the last part of her sentence) well... i can not believe this.
i was just being a good guy.
i treated you with respect and understanding.
hey, i was looking out for you.
i got to say, i have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
hey you know what?
you know what?
to avoid this little thing in the future, let us just say, you and me, never having sex again.
that is right, sex is off the table.
(the door starts to open behind him and dr. green emerges) i am never having sex with you again.
(rachel stays quiet and after a few moments ross realizes what has happened.
he turns abruptly) dr. green, are you feeling better?
(rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look) emma's down for the night.
so uh... i guess i want to take off.
oh, no problem.
thank you.
I am glad you agree.
yeah... yeah, that is true.
oh, ye-ah!
...valentine's day... hmmm-mmmm.
not even once.
even if we want it really bad.
uhm, right!
yeah.
...i hate waste.
yes?
damn it.
it is never off the table.
(he leaves the apartment) i know what you mean, I have always wondered how different my life would be if-if I would never gotten divorced.
the first time!
no seriously, imagine if carol had not realized she was a lesbian.
I would bet I would still be doing my kara-tay.
(that is karate, he is just saying it that way.)
towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.
no, i just think monica was that fat.
what?!
hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we would still hang out?
(recognizing her) oh my god!
rachel green?
no-no.
it is-it is me, ross!
no, no-no, ross geller.
yeah.
right.
good-good, I am-I am married.
(shows her his ring.)
is-is not it the best?
oh really, really great!
yeah!
a-actually she is right down the street, umm, do-do you know what?
you should stop bye and say hi.
yeah?
oh-oh, she would be so excited!
come on!
(they start to leave.)
no, it is okay.
some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but i do not… (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) okay.
uh-huh.
(steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.)
hey, here you go buddy.
sorry, no porn for you.
(to rachel) okay, let us go see monica!
hey mon!
mon, look who i ran into!
(gestures towards rachel.)
and, and uh, you-you remember my friend chandler.
(points to him.)
and that is phoebe over there!
(points to her.)
(answering it) 1987, the day after christmas, at sean mcmahon’s party.
i played you one of my songs, y’know interplanetary courtship ritual.
sometimes, you should come over (joey returns from the bathroom) sometime!
I will play you one of my other… (to rachel) hey-hey, or i could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
come on pheebs, it is not that bad!
y’know most people would be excited if they did not have to work for a couple of weeks.
well umm, I have been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
yeah.
well, last weekend… …will be two months… …since i stopped trying.
what-what do you mean?
oh.
wow!
okay, i think i got it.
so honey, this morning was fun, huh?
me hopping in on you in the shower there.
look carol umm, i was, i was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
carol our sex life is—it is just not working… hey there little fella!
hey, uh-hey, why do not we get some shoes on ya, huh?
hey, why do not you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!
yay!!
yay!
(to carol) seriously, our sex life… i was thinking, maybe i do not know, we could try some-some new things.
y’know?
for fun?
well i do not know umm, (pause) what if we were too tie each other up?
(carol’s shocked and obviously does not like that idea.)
umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
(carol does not like that idea either.)
nah!
umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk?
(carol still says no.)
umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
come on.
(helps her into bed as her phone rings.)
i got it.
i got it!
(on the phone) hello?
(listens.)
no she can not come to the phone right now.
(listens.)
oh, right no problem.
okay, bye-bye.
(hangs up.)
j-j-just relax, nobody yelled.
jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
(to monica) yeah, she is fired.
so honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, i mean how-how are you going to start to find… oh.
(he takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.)
wow!
(flips to another page.)
huh.
(flips another page.)
boy!
(flips another page.)
well, someone is been doing their homework.
(flips two more pages.)
oh, i know.
(laughs) y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kind of… yeah?
well, i-i think ben’s asleep.
yeah.
right.
save it.
i can do that.
(gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
hey, pheebs!
hey, how is it going?
she does not know she was fired yet, does she?
hey pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
we are really going to do this, huh?
y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at… (a knock on the door interrupts him.)
okay.
I am-I am ross by the way.
how hot is this?!
hey!
look at you!
you are up!
hey joe did… did you ever have a threesome?
no!
the reason I am asking is that… i sorta had one last night.
yeah!
yeah!
it was, it was okay.
look, it is just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "would really anyone miss me if i were not here?"
oh-oh, absolutely!
it is just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
not-not really.
th-th-there was just carol.
no, she kept kicking me away!
no!
oh i a lot of stuff!
a little.
yeah.
i made a snack.
just a sandwich.
turkey, a little mustard… it really was!
hey rachel.
umm, no.
that-that is always good news.
are you okay?
yeah.
okay.
(he does so.)
we are sorry.
did not you spend last night at joey’s?
look i-i do not know what is going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can i just say not all men are like that.
hey!
there are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work!
okay?
there are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
men.
i guy i know.
she is not… (realizes) she is gay.
oh my god.
she is so gay!
i can not believe this.
I am sorry your husband cheated on you.
try telling my wife that.
she barely knows me.
we just live in the same building.
she lent me an egg once.
aw, right.
hey.
(stutters something incoherent) an egg?
i think it is insane.
hi.
she said yes.
I am just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from new york to los angeles, he does not just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
the blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
if you want to put a label on it.
nope, nope, that is it.
oh, and she is pregnant with my baby.
i always forget that part.
(to carol and susan) helloo!
so, um, what do you do for a living?
now that is funny.
hey, do you think...would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us?
because she is, she is alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
are you sure?
great.
carol?
want to come over and join us?
come on.
these people'll scooch down.
you guys'll scooch, will not you?
let us try scooching!
come on.
come on.
uh, kristen riggs, this is carol willick.
carol, kristin.
uh, carol teaches sixth grade.
and, kristin, kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, was not even her major!
you did so.
i swear, i swear—(noticing kristin's absence) how long has she been in the bathroom?
well maybe it is cold in there.
or maybe i screwed up the first date i had in 9 years.
oh, god.
(he puts his head down on the grill) you know, this is still pretty hot.
(he picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head.
carol picks it off and eats it.)
no, it is just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing.
well, do i have to?
i mean, I am sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she is perfectly nice, and, but that there is, that is it.
and um, and then I am here talkin' to you, and, and it is easy, and it is fun, and, and i do not, i do not have to...you know, here is a wacky thought.
um, what is say you and i give it another shot?
no no no, i know what you are going to say, you are a lesbian.
but what do you say we just put that aside for now you know?
let us just stick a pin in it, ok?
because, we are great together, you know.
you can not deny it.
besides, you are carrying my baby.
i mean, how perfect is that?
but see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there is something right here.
i love you.
no but, no but.
that is easy for you to say, you found one already.
hi!
(sets ben down) well, it is not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he is auditioning.
i know, it is crazy!
we were just pushing ben on the swings… (from the bathroom) okay!!
all right, i got to take off.
I am picking up ben then we are off to the big audition.
yeah.
yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
you are not his godfather.
(pause) of course i am!
(joey is relieved) okay, let us go godfather.
really?
that is great!
yeah well, he is not going to get this one.
ben is way cuter than that kid.
i mean look at him, look at you, (starts to whine like a baby and joey just glares at him.)
joey, you look nothing like ben.
(entering, downtrodden) hi.
not so good.
(pause) yeah i am!
yeah, ben got a second audition!
oh god, this is so nerve wracking!
how-how do you do this?
yes!!
i knew it!!
(to the people who did not make it.)
bye-bye!
so long!
later!
yeah!
yeah, it is.
no, we-we are going to be like best friends, that is why it is going to be weird.
seriously that is a lot of cups.
hey!
what is up?
wow, uh, joey that is-that is great.
thanks man.
well, you just… what?!
why should ben step aside?
it was his audition in the first place!
you-you just tagged along!
you are like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
what?!
and why would not he get it?
are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
oh yeah?
i guess we will just see!
you are kid's name is raymond!
(entering, angrily) joey!
(angrily) ben!
(pause.)
(happily.)
i mean, ben!
ben!
hey!
listen man, uh, I am sorry the audition did not go so well.
no really, i-i am!
i feel bad!
yeah y'know what?
maybe-maybe you did not mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
i think, sub-consciously… (pause) i think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that ben would get the part.
no!
there you go.
thank you!
no.
it is all right.
hey, what took you guys so long?
your cab left when ours did!
apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
look, pheebs-pheebs, it is going to be okay.
yeah, he is head of the department.
hello.
hey, where are monica and rachel anyway?
to be fair, he does not seem to be impersonating fonzie… again, it is not that he… okay, phoebe, this dr. oberman.
he has no strong feelings about fonzie or any of the happy days gang.
(entering) hey!
i just heard.
what is up?
breathe!
breathe!
breathe throw the pain.
i do too!
i do too!
argh!
argh!
you did it, man.
people can hear you.
yeah.
that is one good looking man!
dude!
here is your girlfriend’s button.
(holding the button.)
hey!
well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.
oh-oh, alec baldwin and kim basinger.
yeah.
they are not a couple!
oh yeah!
no.
y’know what, i do not know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
oh no-no-no, I am there.
oh yeah!
somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
all right, let us not jump to any conclusions.
all right?
there was some sexual chemistry between them.
here she comes.
do not say a word, okay?
just be cool, do not be…y'know you.
hey!
oh, absolutely!
(chandler mumbles something.)
okay, i… (walks away.)
uh, hello!
oh, yumm!
cookies and porn, you are the best mom ever!!
yeah, how does jason look in a v-neck?
oh, whatever.
(laughs and gives joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment.
joey follows him) so you were right?
chandler!
he is right, what she did was unforgivable.
how might you be wrong?
that is all you are basing this on?
so the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
oh my god!
this is beautiful!
look, mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
hey!
what are you saying?
well, if-if she thought they were on a break… pheebs, did…you want a cookie?
hey guys!
all right, here is the ring.
(shows chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving emily) so uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
i sort’ve already asked chandler.
joey, i figured you would understand.
i mean, i-I have known him a lot longer.
(to chandler) wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and i never get to be yours at all?
hey, how can it not be me?!heyhey!
fine, y’know what, that is it.
from now on, joey, i want you to be my best man.
great.
great.
yeah.
tell ya what, let us not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
yeah, see, i do not think it is going to that difficult considering this one will not be taking place in the basement of a pizza hut.
look, i got to go pick up ben.
everything so far sounds great joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay?
just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
okay, see ya later.
hey listen man, about the stripper… good call!
hey-hey, what are those?
wow!
yeah!
smooth man.
yeah, you got some chilie on your neck.
(chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.)
well, i just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great.
and hey!
see you guys monday morning.
(they museum geeks wave at him.)
thanks joey.
oh, thanks!
(takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
(entering) hey guys!
i just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
and the guys from work had a blast.
y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
yeah!
and-and another one had never been to a party before, so… yeah, right!
that ring?
when my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
oh absolutely!
it has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
my-my ring?
my-my wedding ring?
the-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
h-how?!
how could this all happen?!
(dialling the phone) all right-all right, fine!
i-I am going to call the cops!
not on you!
on the stripper!
okay, well, we will call the company that sent her!
so what, joey?
wh-wh-what?
what are you telling me?
that there is nothing we can do?
well, how could this happen?!
diverse.
where is my ring?
my dead grandmother’s wedding ring?
where is it?
where is it?
we know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
joey!
the vet said it is a simple procedure.
oh my god!
thank you!
thank you so much!
(he grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it is been.)
no, that is all right.
hey!
hey!
hey!
i get to choose my best man, and i want both you guys.
hey, both you guys should be up there with me.
i mean, you two are-are my… i mean, I am lucky to have just one good… (they all start getting emotional.)
total wuss!
i ross... take thee, rachel...(all his friends have looks of shock on their faces.
he realizes what he said.
quickly he says.)
emily.
(a slight chuckle.)
emily.
i, ross… take thee, (glares at the minister) emily.
(chuckles) like there would be anybody else.
(emily is glaring at him.)
as my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us.
really, i do.
emily.
(points at her.)
happy too.
yay!
okay.
(laughs) that uh, that was pretty funny.
was not it?
(exiting the bathroom) that-that-that is all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie.
I will be right out here.
(she slams the door in his face, to the gang) she is just fixing her makeup.
and, i love you!!
(he walks into the living room) that is true, thanks dad.
(to all) people should be dancing!
huh?
hey, this is a party!
come on!
joey, dance!!
(he starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)
hi!
oh no!
it could be better, but it is going to be okay, right?
no!
no!
of course it did not mean anything!
i mean, uh well, i can understand why emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you… but it absolutely did not.
(yelling towards the bathroom) it did not!!
it did not!!
(sarcastic) oh!
oh-oh, the band’s ready!
well, i-i-we got to do what the band says—i do not care about the stupid band!!
look, I am sorry.
oh, right!
(bangs on the bathroom door) emily?
emily?
I am coming in.
(he opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with emily.)
(entering) emily?!
no, I have looked everywhere!
no!
for all i know, she is trying to find me but could not because i kept moving around.
no, from now on, I am staying in one place.
(he sits down on the bed.)
right here.
actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
(disappointed) that is cool.
thanks guys!
(they both sit down on either side of him.)
i really appreciate this, y’know, but you do not have to rub my butt.
them-emily?
(looking around for her.)
them-emily?
(he runs to the door.)
emily!
(he opens the door to reveal the walthams standing outside.)
wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
now, hold on!
hold on!
(stops him) look, look, your daughter and i are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I am going to be at that airport and i hope that she will be there too!
oh yeah, i said rachel’s name, but it did not mean anything, okay?
she is-she is just a friend and that is all!
(rachel sits down, depressed.)
that is all!
now just tell emily that i love her and that i can not imagine spending my life with anyone else.
please, promise me that you will tell her that.
rach!
rach!
hi!
what are you, what are you doing here?
oh.
not yet.
pretty soon i guess.
i just, i do not understand, i mean, how-how can she do this?
y’know, what, am i, am i like a complete idiot for thinking that she would actually show up?
same difference.
i get it!
well, that is that.
what?
oh, i do not, i do not, i do not know… i could, yeah, i can do that.
i can not, i can not even believe her!
no, y’know what, i am, i am going to go!
i know, why not?
right?
y’know—thanks!
(they hug) yeah, well…nah.
why do not you come, i mean, i-i have two tickets, why not?
yeah, yeah, it will be great!
you can, you can lay on the beach and i can cry over my failed marriage.
see-see how i make jokes?
no really, i mean, i mean, god, i could use a friend.
okay!
cool!
come on!
(they go to the jetway, ross hands the tickets to the gate agent.)
here.
ah!
ah!
i forgot my jacket!
you tell them to wait!
emily.
oh no-no-no!
oh-no!
(emily starts to run out and ross chases her.)
no!
no!
emily!
grazie.
what is going on?
ah, the lesser-known "i do not have a dream" speech.
hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you are not dating a puma?
her name is celia.
she is not a bug lady.
she is curator of insects at the museum.
oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I would introduce her to my monkey.
well, i do not know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I am hoping (gestures) huh-huh.
celia, do not worry!
do not scream!
he is not going to hurt you!
soothing tones, celia.
soothing tones!
marcel... alright... (lifts marcel away) ok.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning... (embarrassed) wha... what, here?
ah.... (panicked) er.... um..... um... uh.... vulva.
alright, i panicked, alright?
she took me by surprise.
you know, but it was not a total loss.
i mean, we ended up cuddling.
shut up!
it was nice.
i just... i do not think I am the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
(deadpan) please be kidding.
ok. (closes eyes) I am in my apartment... that is it.
I am in my apartment, you are not there, we are not having this conversation.
(gets up, walks across room) joey, please.
(impressed) wow.
i... ahem... i really do not think so.
yeah.
sure.
ok, turn around.
(joey looks taken aback) i just do not want you staring at me when I am doing this.
ahem... i want.... ok, i want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
i, er... i want to take my tongue... and... ....and.... ...run it all over your body until you are... trembling with... with... (rushing to explain) funny story!
yeah!
look, you will get there.
you are an amazing chef.
oh, i was unbelievable.
i was the james michener of dirty talk.
it was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard.
i mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
well, ahem... you know, by the time we would finished with all the dirty talk, it was kind of late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh... yeah, which was nice.
hi.
why not?
it is built into the price of the room.
thread!
what disposable cameras?
no you did not.
oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if i could do you a favor, and my uncle murray came up to you and handed you a check.
and then you said, "why do they call it a check?
why not a yugoslavian?"
(chandler laughs.)
yeah, then you did that.
no.
sorry man.
well, I am sure they are still somewhere here in the hotel.
I will-I will help you look for them.
in-in three minutes.
chandler?
no.
did you?
well i checked in the uh, lost and found, i talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.
now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
I am sorry man.
(formally dressed people start to enter.)
here is a thought.
this is the same ballroom.
there is a band.
there is going to be plenty of dressed up people.
no-no-no, I am saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures.
all we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.
I am just thinking about your new bride at home.
okay?
do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
I am telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding!
are not these the same flowers?
what about the chairs?
how about the place settings?
what did you do?
hmm.
(they head off to the gift shop.)
i heard it.
i heard it.
okay.
okay!
will the owner of a 1995 buick lesabre please see the front desk?
your car is about to be towed.
a ’95 lesabre?!
a green lesabre?
I am sorry, i meant a blue lesabre.
well go!
go move it!
(he runs off.)
yeah.
now you are going to love these.
huh, did not see that coming.
well, I am going to go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.
no-no, i took them from the hotel lobby.
yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.
(starts to leave.)
hey!
my sweater!
I have been looking for this for like a month!
hey!
how you doing?
yeah.
oh hey, right back at ya.
yeah.
she—well, she is one crazy lady?
(shows tag his sweater tag) umm, i do not some italian guy.
come on, read your own label.
see you later.
he is so weird.
hey!
oh, yeah, no problems.
it is all taken care of.
oh yeah, why not?
okay.
(sits down next to phoebe.)
you uh, you want to hear something weird?
i did not get the annulment.
we are still married!
do not tell rachel.
see you later.
(he gets up leaving phoebe in shock.)
(to rachel) hey, do you have any gum?
i know.
well, i tried!
but when i got to my lawyer’s office all i could hear was, "three divorces.
three divorces!"
look, i just do not want my tombstone to read, ross gellar, three divorces.
look, all i know is i-i can not have another failed marriage!
well, okay so, i do not have it all worked out quite yet.
just do not say anything to rachel, please?
hey!
hi!
what is up?
oh my god.
ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up.
oh, that is great.
that is great.
(kisses and hugs her.)
bye.
could ya just, could ya just lay off, please?
all right?
my life is an embarrassment!
i should go live under somebody is stairs!
(interrupting) no!
no, i will not!
I will be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
the only guys below me will be four divorce guy uh, murderer guy, and-and, geologists.
oh yeah?
have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
what?!
why?
and if you wait right here, I will go get ross.
(phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
…once you know the stories, it is not that bad.
first marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault.
second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault.
third marriage, well they really should not allow you to get married when you are that drunk and have writing all over your face, nevada’s fault.
what?!
this is crazy!
i mean, yes-yes rachel is my good friend and i-i have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife!
phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
we were drunk!
i would have married uh, joey with that amount of alcohol!
(to the panel) look, I am sorry, but you guys are wrong.
i just do not want to be divorced three times.
(getting up) okay!
fine!
fine!
if-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing!
okay, i-I will go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled!
okay?!
because she means nothing to me!
noth—(leans down to meg’s ear)—nothing!!
yes.
yes, second in two years.
third overall.
basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk… yes-yes-yes!
but, i-i do not love her.
this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled.
i think just the annulment for today.
easy.
no problem.
ooh!
there is no way to do this without her?
‘because i kind of all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel?
(russell glares at him.)
i will think about the therapy.
oh no.
i could not.
it is not that.
okay?
annulments are more complicated than i… i… i do, i do not love rachel.
I am going to tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
okay?
would i do that if i loved her?
i do not have feelings for rachel!
okay?!
(he goes into her apartment.)
ohh, what is wrong?!
oh my—come here!
come here!
(he hugs her.)
it is okay.
everything’s going to be okay.
of course.
no thanks!
(in a mocking voice)uh...sure i do, and i also want to be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart.
the woman just vanished!
no!
do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery?
i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
seriously you guys, i can not believe you are going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that is such a bunch of boohaki.
oh oh, we think emma is about to start talking so we are trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
(yelling to monica)they are towing your car, they are towing your car!!
(panting)they are towing a car.
and i am seeing...spots.
yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
(to monica)think he washed his hands?
(mockingly)yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
(mockingly)a psychic and a wishbone?
guys!
give someone else a chance!
you know what, I am sure your wish is going to come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!
(rubs lamp, stops because it is very hot) ah!!
that thing gets hot!!
uh, you are not going to win.
ok, I have heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that.
why would i eat my own arm?
why?
you do not have to do that, I will pay for myself.
but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that is so sweet!
come here (they kiss and hug) i do not know, probably just invest it.
oh, I am sorry, did i say "invest it"?
i meant "be cool and piss it all away" (joey and chandler pleased) (to rachel) uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?
oh, I have gotten into the habit of calling rachel "mommy" when we are around emma.
which i now realize we are not ... although if we are going to do that, we should probably call me "daddy" too.
i ... i was just talking about rachel.
(tries to be sexy too) well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no i can not.
i can not believe this, i thought we were all in this together!
3 minutes ago!!!
i do not know why that is important ... than i want mine, too (takes the bowl from joey)!
and if i win I am going to put it all into a very low-yield bond.
(trying to stop her) hey, hey!!
monica!
go, go, go!!
weird.. your psychic did not mention anything about the scary pigeon... oh yeah, it is a good idea!
(on the phone) goodnight sweetheart!
i love you.
and remember, you are daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to rachel) phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to rachel) oh, we have one too!!
(calling rachel) come on!!
oh yeah, no no no...that is great!
oh, rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
okay, what does it mean?
I am just, I am just glad i did not miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).
yes you did, gleba is a word!
ok, use it in a sentence.
it is not a word!
oh, oh, ok, great.
you know what, while you are at it she said another word the other day, why do not you, why do not you look up: pbbqqt.... she is going to be a scientist!
(kisses rachel on the head, very moved) me too.
so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park.
phoebe, you do not have any of the first five numbers.
i guess if everybody else is...  excuse me?
you are right, you are right, it is.
so you going to invite us all to the big opening?
it is your turn.
wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it did not go well but it really did go well?
totally!
great!
wow!
oh, i love that guy!
(laughs.)
(stops laughing) what am i doing?
look, do not worry.
okay?
you are going to be fine.
yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
oh my god!
you ate my sandwich?
(getting upset) oh-oh really?
(jumping to his feet in anger) what?
you-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
(losing control, we hear him shout outside) my sandwich?!!!
my sandwich!!!!!!
(ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
what?
what?
yes, yes it is.
in prison!
it took two people to break up this relationship!!
i did not know what i was taking full responsibility for!
okay?!
i did not finish the whole letter!
i fell asleep!
it was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages.
front and back!!
(they go into the living room, trapping monica, chandler, and joey in the kitchen) (to rachel) oh-oh-oh, and by the way, y-of-you-apostrophe-r-e means ‘you are,’ y-of-you-r means ‘your!’ (starts to cry) fine by me!!
(he opens the door and traps chandler behind it) that will be a neat trick, when you are, (looks at the script) when you are dead!
there was just an explosion, okay?
my hearing would be impaired.
thank you!
and i have to say that first scene when you meet mac… oh my god.
i mean… totally.
what did you want to show us?
because all i can see is this bitchin' van!
i do not know, i could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there is this thing about bumblebees on the discovery channel that i was planning to watch.
nooo!!
gandolf?!
gandolf is coming to town?
dude, we are sooo going to party!
mike "gandolf" ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
I am going to call after you!
joey, you are going to love this guy.
gandolf is like the party wizard!
gandolf the wizard.
(joey is still confused) hello!
did not you read lord of the rings in high school?
(entering) hey!
okay!
i got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
somewhere maybe along the equator?
what happened?
ohh, man!
chicago, is sooo lucky!
it is gandolf, and he is not coming.
no!
i balanced my checkbook.
i can not believe he did not come!
yeah!
we would meet, we would meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
there is other stuff too.
yeah!
yeah!!
it is not like we do not know how to party!!
(to chandler) hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
yeah.
okay.
I am kind of beat.
yeah, me too.
I am just glad i brought that extra pair of socks, y’know?
i used them as mittens, i did not want to touch a thing in that last place.
how sad are we?
and so what if i like to go home, throw on some kenny g, and take a bath!
hey!
i just got uh, my teacher evaluations!
check out what this one student wrote, "i loved dr. geller’s class.
mind blowing lectures!
dr. geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
oh, i wish i knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
yeah.
it is a girl!
anyway, it wou—it would not matter.
okay?
because I am a teacher and she is a student.
no, but it is frowned upon.
besides, there is a big age difference.
i know when I am 90 she will be like 80 and it will not seem like such a big difference.
(startled) yeah?
oh thank you.
thanks very much.
(leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.)
ow!
(he pulls away.)
that was you?
oh i, i do not-i do not think that would be the best idea.
what time?
gotcha.
(starts to leave.)
oh!
so-so seriously, what time?
what?
of course i did!
you uh, you sat next to sleepy sleeperson.
oh uh, i had trouble remembering everyone is name, so i-i kind of came up with nicknames.
like the guy on the other side of you was smelly von brownshirt.
umm, no.
no.
umm, it is cutie mcpretty.
listen, i got to tell ya, i-I am having a great time!
y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank i thought it would be too, but it is not.
i mean it is not at all.
(pushing elizabeth into a doorway) burt!
we had such a great time!
she is-she is incredible!
i thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it was not.
it was not at all.
elizabeth is very mature for her age.
(joey makes the international sign for big boobies.)
(to monica) a concept lost on some people!
well, not really.
i mean technically it is-it is not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
especially by that professor we ran into last night, judgey von holierthanthou.
yeah.
what-what should i do?
going out with who?
oh yeah!
was not she uh… (does the international sign for big boobies.)
what do you want to do now?
huh?
you want to go get a drink?
oh, you have some studying to do?
y’know i remember when uh, when i was in college, we used to… (he sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
nothing, I am-I am just, I am so comfortable with you!
what?
no!
of course, of course i do!
are-are they gone?
what?!
no!
no!
wait!
you are right, this is stupid.
who cares what people think?
i mean, i mean we like each other right?
there is nothing wrong with that.
come on.
(they get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.)
burt?
lydia?
mel?
this is elizabeth.
that is right lydia, elizabeth here is a student and uh, we are dating.
and you may frown upon that, but we are not going to hide it anymore.
what?
really?
its not just frowned upon?
wow!
it actually is in the handbook.
i can not date you or have a hot plate in my office.
i can not believe we have to stop seeing each other.
i know, i know i really like you too.
but we-we can not date.
it is against the rules.
it is forbidden.
what?
really?
well i-i-i do not care how hot it is it is-it is uh, it is wrong.
(feeling it too) no!
no!
it is wrong!
it is-it is-it is naughty.
it is taboo.
let us also get a hot plate!
hey!
what are you guys looking at?
yeah?
wow!
it looks really violent!
now i cannot wait to see this.
uh sweetie, maybe you would be more comfortable here?
(gets up from the green armchair.)
look, i-i know how miserable you are, i wish there was something i can do.
i mean i wish i were a seahorse.
(she glares at him) because with seahorses it is the male, they carry the babies.
and then also umm, I would be far away in the sea.
(he sits back down.)
(entering) hey is rachel here?
we have a doctor’s appointment.
rach, we got to go.
people ask me why we are not together, i just do not know what to tell them.
uh, do you want to go change first?
the doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry… really?
you do not think that is a little inappropriate.
(she is wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
fine!
fine!
y’know what?
whatever you want.
okay?
you are the mommy.
yeah?
uh-huh.
mmm?
wow!
oh nothing.
nothing!
just uh, you have been a little short with me lately.
I am not trying to irritate you.
y’know what?
the doctor will be in soon, why do not we not speak until then.
y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that is half human and half pure evil!
(to rachel) oh, you are nice to her.
do them!!
you have got to be kidding me!
hey.
yeah, we tried them all.
we went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
it is sex.
monica!
monica, what is the matter with you?
what?!
while she is been going through this hell, you have been making money?!
you are betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
(phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)
what?!
can i get some of that action?
come on, finish your enchilada.
okay here, have one of these peppers.
oh ha… oh god!
so…so hot!
(rubs his eyes.)
oh my—(laughs.)
by the way, you do not want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
stop it.
I am sorry, but we have to have some boundaries!
my god, I am dying.
this is insane, I am not going to make love to you just so that you will go into labor.
always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
i love when you talk dirty to me.
okay enough!
this is, this is not going to happen.
y’know what?
forget it.
I am getting that baby out of you!
oh, i know.
i am good.
okay!
okay!
uh, i got the pillow!
i got the bag!
you got the keys?
hey!
we are having a baby.
not so much.
(entering) hey!
yeah!
(they high-five.)
ohh… y'know, i think they have those at that british pub near the trade center.
is not rachel supposed to be back by now?
oh, so-so you talked to her.
did she, did she sound mad?
okay, i did not abandon rachel!
okay?
emily showed up at the airport!
i had to go after her!
i mean, i-i did what i had to do!
she is my wife!
rachel is my wife!
y'know—emily!
emily, is my wife!
man, what is that?
no, not since i lost her at the airport.
hey, she is fast!!
okay?!!
(chandler is so shocked at ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) oh!
you-you think you can be beat me?
let us go!
outside!!
rach, rach, i am so sorry.
i am so-so sorry.
that is it?
you are not mad?
i mean, it must have been terrible.
so, what?
that is it?
oh, thanks.
oh, you are the best.
(they hug.)
(breaking the hug) ohh, i got to go to the flower store!
(runs to the door.)
check it out, no one will tell me where emily is, so I am going to send 72 long-stem, red roses to emily's parent's house, one for each day that I have known and loved her.
that oughta get her talking to me again.
hi.
she is doing her laundry.
it came in the mail today, it is uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I have known and loved emily, cut up into mulch!
oh, it is not so bad.
monica's going to make potpourri!
i think I am going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
i can not catch a break!
what thing?
monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky.
I am going to use the phone.
i got to cancel those five giant teddy bears i sent to emily.
(looks at the rose mulch.)
my god, think of the massacre.

my wife will not return my calls.
i do not know where my wife is.
(laughs) "hey ross, where is the mrs.?"

well, i kind of half to.
i mean, because the thing is… that is what the thing is.

(picks a pad up off rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) good bye.

forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.

and second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but did not fly.
y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what i do, i wonder how many people would go see a movie called, jurassic parka.
no-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.
(makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it is alive and attacking him.)
no.
i... i wanted to be with you.
i do not know, i feel like lately, i feel like you are slipping away from me, y'know.
with this new job, and all these new people, and you have got this whole other life going on.
i-i-i know it is dumb, but i hate that I am not a part of it.
that is a little clearer.
sure, i-i-i... (hugs her and mouths no!!)
is everything okay?
sure.
people (shakes head, they sit) so why you all dressed up.
oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
you know i really admire your whole dating attitude, it is so healthy I am always like is this moving to fast?
is this moving to slow?
where is this going?
but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
there is not that is what I am saying.
(all happy) i know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
no, no, no there is nothing wrong with you i mean you do not strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
please do not cry because of me pheebs i do not know what I am talking about, I have been divorced three times.
I am sorry i did not catch.
oh ross geller do you have a compact in your purse?
you look great.
so how did the date go?
so he has not called?
now i feel terrible this is all my fault.
we are a rare breed.
(he knocks at the door, mike opens it) hey mike sorry to just drop by like this, can i come in?
I am ross, phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
yeah i really, really need to talk to you about something.
(laughs) no damn super cuts!
oh no yeah, no phoebe is great, but umm I am an idiot look right before you guys went out i accidentally got her all upset.
yes, yeah i said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please do not blow her off.
well then i did not need to bother you or the four other mike hanagens i bothered.
of course she has.
if she would never had a serious relationship I would go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
yes, yes i did.
and i will also say what I am about to say vis-�-vis the following phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her.
super-serious relationship with.
vicrum.
what that is a real name!
hey!

(he continues the happiness with her by dancing around) quick thing, i went to talk to mike.
oh boy you got mad at that part.
i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended up telling him that.
umm.
that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum.
well he seemed to bum hard that you would never been in a serious relationship.
well phoebe, i think you will feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer (he makes a wow face) and he used to date oprah.
(he makes another wow face) good yeah just be honest with him.
I will get it (they kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it up, its ross putting on an accent pretending to be vicrum) this is vicrum.
you what?
wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
alright, alright.
we are all adults here, there is only one way to resolve this.
since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you are going to have to show her your peepee.
yeah.
what, so he was a little analytical.
that is what he does, y'know?
c'mon, he is not that bad.
y'see, that is where you are wrong.
why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
why?
why would i why?

i do not get it.
what do you see in this guy, anyway?
rachel, come on.
give us a chance.
no, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else?

i know.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
what makes you think we are going to break up?

no problem.
i cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
yeah.
no, no, they will.
i just... uh... come on, they are going to love you.
what happened?
yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
huh, what is fish hooking... (joey sticks his finger in ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.)
(to joey, sarcastic) thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe.
what is that taste?
(on phone) that is right, ryder.
wynona ryder for six.
(listens) thank you.
(hangs up) (to the gang) yeah, we have the reservations.
(stunned) dude, what are you doing?
all right so, chandler, from now on, do not give your boss a chance to get you.
y'know just ah, do not turn your back to him.
(walking up with this huge tub-of-popcorn and drink) hey!
yeah, it is the ultimate fighting combo.
yeah, i saved thirty cents, plus i get to keep the cup.
yay!!
well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
all right!
you go get him!
let us go!
hey!
how long until pete’s fight?
hot dog?

oh!
i got to tell you, i-i was not expecting to like her at all, i mean i actually was not expecting to like anyone right now, but she is really terrific.
no, i-I am saying i liked her.
pheebs, i think she is great.
okay?
we are going out again.
ahh, the one next to my foot.
sorry.
okay, we will be right in.
(to chandler) so ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
well, this is ironic.
of your last two boyfriends, richard did not want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now pete can not.
i mean, i do not feel like i even have a girlfriend anymore.
is this about mark?
okay, it is not, it is not.
fine, you are right.
let us ah, let us take a break, (goes to the door) let us cool off, okay, let us get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door) (on the phone) I have been thinking, this is crazy, i mean do not, do not you think we can work on this?
who is that?
is that mark?
yeah!

(slams down the phone) yeah!!
na-huh.
i love you.

chloe, chloe how is it coming?!!
umm, oh, hey, i do not know.
how about a big one?
well then a small one!!
listen, let us, we kind of have to get going!
you, you sure you need shoes?
(chloe nods her head) okay.
(reaches down and picks up a shoe) yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend i told you about last night?
(he is frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
oh, i found it!!
yeah!
yes, yes i am, one of the many things I am feeling.
well.... (picks up her coat) oh, thank you.
(she goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.)
hey, hey.
(opens the door, sees rachel, and hides chloe behind the door) rachel!!!!
yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
yes, you can, very much.
(seeing the thumbs up) ahhhh!!
(hugs rachel tighter.)
you think?!
god, i, ah, I am in hell.
i mean what, what am i going to do?
rachel’s all like, ‘i love you and, and let us work on this.’ and all i can think about is, ‘what is she going to do?
what is she going to say?’ when i tell her what i did.
what?!
look, we are trying to rebuild a relationship here, right.
how am i supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
yeah, but do not you think.... yeah, okay.
(he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)
what trail?
oh, i-i do not think there is any trail.
(entering) chloe?
hi.. you took my watch?
just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
exactly.
so you did not, did not mention anything to issac right?
you tell, of course you do.
issac.
issac.
hey, issac.
issac, hi!
y'know we have not actually met... yes, i suppose i am a dog.
but issac, see i-i happen to have a girlfriend.
yeah, that is the one.
listen, i do not want to hurt her.
yeah.
listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
actually, no, we are not.
no, we are not.
no, we are not!!
right.
fine.
i just need to know that you are not going to tell your sister.
(entering out of breath) jasmine?
we met at phoebe’s birthday party, I am, I am ross geller.
yes, i did.
very bad.
I am agreeing with you.
did you, listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet?
okay, jasmine, please, please do not.
i love my girlfriend very much, and i want more than anything to just work it out with her.
okay?
thank you, thank you.
(angrily) who is your roommate?
gunther!
gunther.
gunther, please tell me you did not say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place.
(forcing the door open) come on, rachel, come on!
talk to me!
please!!
rachel?
no, it was a mistake!
i made a mistake!
okay?
no!!
no!!
no!!
i want to stay.
i want to talk about this.
what?
she was... she, she was different.
nobody likes change.
what?
okay, okay, okay, okay.
I am sorry, okay, I am sorry.
i wa-i was disgusted with myself, and this morning i was so, i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy, and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
listen.
oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
look, i did not think there was a relationship to jeopardise.
i thought we were broken up.
that, for all i knew would, could last forever.
that to me is a break-up.
look, I am not trying to get out of anything, okay.
i thought our relationship was dead!
come on!
like i wanted him to tell you, i ran all over the place trying to make sure that did not happen!
look rachel, i wanted to tell you, i thought i should, i-i did, and then chandler and joey convinced me not to.
do not you realise none of this would have ever happened if i did not think at that same moment you were not having sex with mark?
(pause) yes i would.
(less sure) yes.
(covering his ears and screaming) la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
okay, okay, yeah, i would have been devastated but, i would still want to be with you.
because it is, i mean it is you.
what?
come on rach, tell me what you are thinking?
order a pizza like, ‘i forgive you?’ hey, can i, can i get in on that?
because I am kind of hungry myself.
no anchovies.
that is okay, I will just pick ‘them off.
you can have the last piece, if you want.
what, now you are not even taking to me?
(moves over to the coffee table) look rachel, i-I am sorry, okay, I am sorry, i was out of my mind.
i thought I would lost you, i did not know what to do.
come on!
come on, how insane must i have been to do something like this?
huh?
i-i do not cheat right, i, that is not me, I am not joey!
y'know what, y'know what, I am-I am not the one that wanted that, that break, okay.
you are the one that bailed on us.
you are the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
that is what?!
okay, well here we are.
now we are in a tough spot again, rach.
what do you want to do?
how do you want to handle it?
huh?
do you want to fight for us?
or, do you want to bail?
(sits down next to her) look, i, (on the verge of tears) i did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing.
okay?
and I am sorry, i wish i could take it back, but i can not.
(we see monica and phoebe are almost in tears.)
i just can not see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.
rachel, i love you so much.
okay, okay, okay.
what?
(moving over to stand in front of her) okay, okay.
this morning you said there was nothing so big that we could not work past it together... look, look, there is got to be a way we can work past this.
okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.)
i can not imagine, i can not imagine my life without you.
(both of them are starting to cry.)
without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
your good heart rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and.... (crying) yeah, but this can not be it, i mean.
right.
no-no, we talked about it.
we do not want to know.
all we care about is that it is happy and healthy.
and smart!
with an aptitude for science.
really?
me too!
maybe.
but it would not hurt to have a backup, you know?
uh, rach-rach, what were you thinking?
(gives her a look) huh.
that is a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
well, ok, it is for a boy.
well, i know it is a little out there, but…darwin.
you are just saying that because i said no to your name!
all right.
that sounds fair.
veto.
rain?
hi.
hi, my name is rain.
i have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
okay, how about, for a guy, thatcher?
fine, you go.
huh.
oh, veto.
how about—ooh, i like ruth!
what about ruth?
veto.
stewart?
veto.
helen?
i do not think you had an open mind about the name ruth.
i mean, come on, little ruthie geller, how-how cute is that?
uh, no.
no, we are not.
no, no, we want to wait, right?
what?
rach!
come on, that is terrible!
they are…uh…they are babies.
they are-they are all beautiful.
yeah, why is it staring at me?
i think it knows I am talking about it.
(rachel starts to peek at the file) do not-do not you—wh—wha—hey!!
you are looking!
i saw you!
shame on you!
ugly baby judges you!
no, no, no, no!
do not tell me!
i do not want to know!
momentary lapse.
do not-do not you have any self-control?
hey.
rach, i-i can not tell you how-how much that means to me!
ohh… wait a minute.
wait a minute.
you-you hated the name ruth!
why-why would you change your mind?
unless, you know we are never going to have to use it.
you did see the folder.
you know it is a boy!
i do not think so!
you are just giving me ruth so you will get to name it when it is a boy, and that is when you will swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia.
veto.
unless… (rachel groans.)
you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named ruth!
well, I am not falling for that!
okay?
ruth is off the table!
not like this!
so, i uh… i called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
that is right.
the student has become the master.
oh, come on, you know it is a girl!
you really did not know?
no.
no.
yes.
I am… I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
i know!
i know.
you know what?
I am putting ruth back on the table!
permission to veto.
(from outside the bathroom) hello?
(entering) well hey!
what is going on?
ooh, cool boat—(sees why the boat’s there)—oh, no.
(averts his eyes by looking around the room) (to rachel) hey, did you, did you tell them?
hey you guys!
uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny.
this is molly (points to molly).
molly, chandler, joey.
ooh, somebody is getting a little fussy.
yeah.
eh, i mean, i mena she is not unattractive but hot?
i .... yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.
you know, when it is right there in your face.
me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive.
makes me feel like i earned it.
ok, I will be home right after work.
ok, by emma-wemma-demma, i love you - wovyou dovyou ... come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok?
just - just forget about her, ok?
just, she is off limits.
what are you, a child?
joey, come on now, for me!
please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
whazzup??
listen, can you do me a favor?
I am going to be out today.
can you just keep an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly?
wh - no.
some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
you do appear right on the cusp of something.
come on man, I am sure he will lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
well we got to do something, ok?
nannies like her do not grow on trees.
(pause) i am, yes.
where the hell are joey and molly?
i asked you to watch them.
we have to stop them before something happens!
molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
thanx.
what do you think you are going to do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
yeah, come on in.
molly?
ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) well, uh, joey, i guess we have no problem.
hey... (surprised) oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) ohh...
I would love to but i really have to grade these papers.
(writing on the papers) b, b, b, b, b!
well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
damnit!
(he opens the door) hi amy!
still sharp as a tack!
(pause) ross?
i... i grew up on your block!
we had thanksgiving together last year... i had a baby with your sister!
(gives up) yes, yes, you did.
hi rachel!
here is your sister amy!
she thinks i need pec implants!
ehm... her name is emma.
what do i know?
i just sell middle eastern food from a cart!
(to joey) oh my god!
what... what you working on?
why do not you use your thesaurus?
watch.
(he takes the laptop) here, you ehm... you highlight the word you want to change.
seriously?
well, do you want to marry him?
absolutely!
you will love the feeling!
there is nothing like it!
no, i can not.
i have back-to-back classes.
did molly say what she had?
because my throat's been hurting?
i do not think that is what this is.
(he interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) well, can i talk to you for a sec.?
um, i do not want her baby-sitting our child.
well, for one thing, she keeps calling her ella!
fine, we will call the next one ella.
(a little confused) okay, um... i do not want her watching our baby.
i... i do not know.. hey guys.
hey emma.
oh, why is she wearing her hat so low?
she can barely see.
(wants to take the hat off, but rachel tries to stop him).
why not?
come here (removes emma's hat) oh!
there she is!
hi!
(sees how strangely monica, chandler and rachel are looking at him) what?
(back to emma) hi!
(looks at her) what... (moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her.
he looks at her confused.
finally he realizes the difference and gasps).
please tell me those are clip-ons.
did she (points at amy) do this to her?
i told you we should not have left emma with her!
that is not a thing!
(very angry) amy, i ju... i just... i just want to... (pointing at amy, shouting) no more falafel for you!
ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
hey!
hey!
if he is moving, maybe i should try to get his place!
it would be so cool to live across from you guys!
oh my god!
i love this apartment!
is not it perfect?!
i can not believe i never realized how great it is!
(laughing) ohh.
(phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and ross quickly hurries out.)
(entering) what is going on?
what?!
what?!
actually, it looks really good.
(turns towards the window and now phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
(entering) hey!
well, i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he is already had like a hundred applicants.
no-no, i got the edge.
i know it is not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to no.
no.
a basket of mini-muffins.
the small one.
well yeah!
someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins.
it was the best day.
oh man!
i want that place so much!!
i was so sure that was going to work!
there is twelve bucks I will never see again!
(exits.)
noooo.
look I have already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
huh?
that is a great idea!
and!
i know ugly naked guy because we have been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge!
oh, let us see now he had the trampoline.
well, he had gravity boots.
okay, I have got to go pick up ben but i-i will figure something out.
(he opens the door and stops.)
hey, did not he used to have a cat?
right.
(exits.)
good evening, sir.
my name is ross geller.
I am one of the people who applied for the apartment.
and i-i realize that the competition is fierce but—I am sorry.
i, i can not help but notice you are naked and (he claps his hands.)
i applaud you.
man, i wish i was naked.
i mean, this-this looks so great.
that is how god intended it.
a new place for a new ross.
I am going to have you and all the guys from work over once it is y'know, furnished.
well i am that.
and that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
oh donald that-that would be great.
i am totally ready to come back to work.
i—what?
(he notices something through the window.)
no!
wh… what are you doing?!!
(dr. ledbetter is slowly backing away.)
get off my sister!!!!!!!!!!!!!
huh?
i know, i know.
who am i?
david bowe?
(shakes his head around, pretending like he is jamming.)
uh, i do not know, whatever.
oh, i know.
y’know what, i never would have gotten this if it were not for you.
no really, when I am with you I am-I am like this whole other guy, i love that guy!
i mean, i love you too, a lot, but that guy!
i-i love that guy!
yeah?
then do not.
stay here.
just do not go so soon to london, just one more day.
one more day, seriously/ so, then you can stay as long as you want.
oh no.
do not, do not, do not start packing.
come on!
(she puts some clothes into her bag, and ross throws them out.)
yeah, i know, i uh, i tried them on.
no.
no, i did not.
i did not want to be that guy.
(entering) hey, guys!
(they both notice his new little friend) oh yeah, emily convinced me to do it.
i like it, and emily likes it, and that is what counts.
so uh, how are you guys doing?
ugh, she is saying good-bye to her uncle.
yeah!!
yeah!
i just, i hate this so much!
i mean, every time i go pick her up at the airport, it is-it is so great.
but at the same time I am thinking, "well, I am going to be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
nothing!
there is nothing to do!
i mean, she lives there, i live here.
i mean, she-she would have to uh, move here.
she should move here!
i could ask her to live with me!
i mean, why not!
i mean, i mean why not?!
look guys, when I am with her it is-it is-it is like she brings this-this-this great side out of me.
i mean i-i-i love her, y’know?
i do not want to do that.
yeah, no, you are right, i know, you are right, I am not, I am not going to do it.
all right, thanks guys.
(gets up to leave.)
hey!
(laughs) move in with me.
do not be scared, i-i know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it is too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
i know.
well, so, you-you will get a job here!
i mean, I am always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing american jobs; that could be you!
no, i can not.
i would, i really would, but my son is here; i can not leave him.
is not—you do not think there is any way?
what?
no, no, do not.
why do not we?
get married.
no!
no!
I am not!
it is-it is-it is perfect!
i mean it is better than you just-just moving here, ‘because it is us together forever, and that is-that is what i want.
yeah, i know, so what?
i mean, who is-who is to say?
does that me we-we can not do it?
look, huh, i was with carol for four years before we got married and i wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian.
i mean, this, this makes sense for us.
come on!
i mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in vermont!
i mean, last night i got my ear pierced!
me!
this feels right.
does not it?
is that—are you saying yes?
is that yes?
yes!
we are getting married?!
yes!
come here, come here.
uh, (he takes the earring out.)
ow!
emily, will you marry me?
damn!
i thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
come on!
come on.
come on.
hey!
uhh, okay, it is uh, emily and i, we decided to uh, to get married.
we, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
(turning around.)
umm, uh, i was just telling the guys… yeah.
(they hug again.)
(seeing her) rach!
it was, it was great.
oh, what happened?
you are bleeding.
well, where do i start?
this is julie.
julie, this is rachel.
that is all right, rach, we got the bags.
hi, hello.
julie, this is my sister monica.
this is chandler.
phoebe.
joey, what up?
everyone, this is julie.
and bus.
the screaming guy?
you got to hear this story.
200 at least.
but we have not seen each other since then.
well i land in china, guess who is in charge of the dig.
well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we are going to go see the baby.
yeah, it is really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
hey, rach, can i get some coffee?
thank you.
i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it is never going to happen, move on.
you know whose voice that was?
it was you, pal.
look, you were right.
she looks at me and sees a friend, that is all.
but then i met julie, and i do not know, we are having a great time.
and i have to say, i never would have gone for it with her if it had not been for you.
i did not order lemonade.
but... ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
(on phone) hello?
hi.
(on phone) ok, ok, sweetheart, I will see you later.
ok, bye.
what?
(sits down next to rachel) oh, that is so sweet.
no, no, ok, you hang up.
ok, ok, one, two, three.
(does not hang up and motions for rachel to be quiet) well you did not hang up either.
ok, no, no, you hang up.
you, you, y... rachel!
I will just call her back.
(calls julie back) hi?
sorry, we got disconnected... (walks away.)
hi.
sorry we are late but we were—well, there was touching.
hey, paulo.
what are you doing here?
(to rachel) so, uh, he is back.
no, not a problem.
how is the hair?
yeah.
(gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that meant.)
(entering from the bedroom) hey, what is going on?
(pats chandler on the shoulder which causes him to jump.)
what?
what?
yes, yes it is.
in prison!
whatsa matter with you?
i like it.
i do, i think it is a ten.
(chandler laughs.)
well, i got to go.
bye.
bye, rach.
yeah, that is kind of what i meant by "bye!"
okay.
(goes out onto the balcony) what is going on?
ok. well, before i say anything, i just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then i tell you what i think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and i look like a complete idiot?
well, then, i think, i think the guy is scum.
i hate him.
i mean i actually—i-i physically hate him.
i always have.
you are way too good to be with a guy like that.
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know?
someone who wakes up every morning thinking "oh my god, I am with rachel".
you know, someone who makes you feel good, the way i am with julie.
(rachel has moved closer, but hearing that she starts to back up.)
was there a second of all?
okay.
okay.
(they hug.)
okay.
(looking at monica's legs) wow!
I am sorry, it is just... how did you get so tan?
eh, you got a spray-on tan?
(laughing) why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
still, i can not believe that is sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good.
i wonder if i should get one!
so, do you get colours or just french tips?
thanks.
(he takes the card) hey, i know where this place is!
it used to be an x-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist.
(he goes away) well... i like how you look, what are you?
two, i think a two.
spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
well, i have a phd, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement) one mississipi, two mississipi, three mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) wait!
wait!
I am not-I have not finished counting!!
(he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room) you sprayed my front twice!
no, i barely even got to three mississippi.
mississippilesly?
(pause) well, how bad is it?
so, how dark is it going to get?
I am a four?
(sarcastically) really!
(annoyed) ok!
wait, wait a minute, there is no light on the back wall!
how do i know when it is going to start?
hello?
(he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) ah, oh, ah!
(he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) ah!
(he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) the same thing happened again!
(hysterically) I am an eight!
i went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
oh!
and it gets worse!
(turns his side to chandler and monica and pulls up his shirt.
there is a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
(looks at her suspiciously) how do you count to five?
(yells) damnit!
(goes to the door to leave.
rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing) (still yelling) i know!
I am going to stop you right there, glenda.
okay?
does it look like this is my first time, huh?
now i want 4 two's... and i want them all on my back.
wait a minute, there is two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
which... which... which... which one is it?
oh!
son of a bitch!
go away!
i do not want to see anybody.
really?
did you count mississipily?
dude, you are not tanned.
so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?
then talk to him!
he might be fine with it.
joey, it is worth finding out.
i mean, if you really like her.
okay, joey, you know what?
you have to go for it.
how often does this happen to you, huh?
you owe it to yourself.
(walks towards the door until…) (closes the door) did you um—I am sorry, did you just say it is rachel?
um, you…you like rachel?
rachel?!
but r-r-rachel-rachel?!
it is not a big deal?
oh, I am sorry i just…um, i…what about all the stuff you-you just said?
i mean how about, i like—you-you can not stop thinking about her.
like how you can not sleep?
rachel who is carrying my baby?
rachel?
y’know what?
i-i got to go.
(starts to leave.)
(stops) i just—y’know—i-i just have one—rachel?!
hey.
oh y’know, i still—i can not believe it.
joey and rachel i mean it is… it is like you and me going out, only weirder!
oh my god!
what if, what if they get married?
then he would be the stepfather of my child.
sure, because women never like joey.
y’know, i think he is a virgin.
he is not?
why?
hate him?
i… no, i do not hate him.
(pause) it is just it is rachel, y’know?
okay.
okay, I will talk to him.
hey.
no, i do not want to hit you.
no.
no, no i do not want to do anything to you.
all right?
i just want to tell you that I am not mad at you and…and that i certainly do not hate you.
i just, i just came here to say that.
(starts to leave.)
uh…yeah sure.
(enters.)
okay.
thank you.
what?!
you are in love with her.
umm, no.
i think you need to tell her how you feel.
no, I am serious.
you-you need to find out where she is, because if she is not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
if she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it should not stand in the way.
yeah.
look if-if she is going to end up with somebody else, the truth is she could not find a better guy.
so… so when do you think you are going to talk to her?
I am understanding, but let us not get carried away.
yeah, tell me about it.
(he stands up, turns his back to joey, and enjoys another sip.)
rach!
hey.
oh.
this was amazing.
yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "sex for dummies" as a joke.
who is laughing now?
what?
oh my god!
phoebe, you were sure ben was going to be a girl.
is rachel here?
uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
hey, I am not one to kiss and tell, but I am also not one to have sex and shut up.
we totally did it!
i know, it is pretty great.
oh, i.. i do not know.
we did not really get to talk.
i do not know.
it was incredible.
i mean, it just felt so right.
when i was holding her, i mean, i never wanted to let her go.
you know what?
yeah, i do.
i want to be together.
shhh!
wow, i had not thought of that.
i hope not.
hey.
hey.
how did you sleep?
good.
uh.
would you guys mind giving us a minute?
so... morning.
it really was.
i know, me too.
it was... you know, it was like one of those things you think is never going to happen, and then it does, and it is everything you want it to be.
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
nothing!
what do you say to that?
no way!
what?
you really think so?
okay.
alright, you know what?
you are right.
i should at least tell her how i feel.
what?
what?
oh my god!
I am not getting you a muffin!
hey.
no, and I am not going to.
because she is just going to shoot me down.
you guys saw what happened with gunther.
that did not look like fun.
yeah, and she still wants to go!
it is pretty clear where she is.
look, even if i were going to tell her, i do not have to do it now.
okay?
I will be seeing her again.
we have got time.
oh my god!
you did that yourself?
oh my god!
oh my god!
okay, okay, awkward question.
the hospital knows you took two, right?
oh my god.
aw, he is going to be so happy.
neither will i. yeah.
yeah?
yeah, that is true.
except i do not want to get over her.
i do not!
i want to be with her.
yeah, I am going to go after her.
my coat... i do not know, but i.. look, even if she shoots me down, at least i will not spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.
where - where is my coat?!
okay, guys, wish me luck.
there is no seatbelt!
alright, alright, let us do this!
hey!
no, you do not understand.
this is not a real cab.
(screaming) get out of the cab!
are we off the bridge?
is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
oh my god, phoebe, slow down!
yes, but i do not want to die in your cab!
what?
okay!
to talk to rachel, is not that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
not since my cop-show got cancelled.
what?
we are never going to make it!
okay, if you could all walk slower, that would be great.
hey, i need a ticket.
fine, two tickets, i need two tickets.
i do not care.
whatever is the cheapest.
okay, flight 421 to paris.
i do not see it, do you see it?
no, no, no.
that is impossible.
it does not leave for another 20 minutes.
what?
hey, hey, listen.. monica?
monica, monica, monica, monica..?
that is alright.
listen, listen.
monica?
monica, monica, monica, monica..?
that is precious!
listen!
i need rachel's flight information.
yes, that is what i have.
it is not on the board.
what?
jfk.
phoebe!
wow!
no, no, no!
phoebe, forget it, okay?
newark is - is like an hour away.
there is no way we are going to make it in time.
i am not doing this over the phone.
yay.
where is she?
rachel!
rachel green!
rachel!
rachel!
no, no, i just have to talk to someone.
no, no, no, but... okay, the thing is.. do not go.
please, please stay with me.
i am so in love with you.
please, do not go.
i know, i know.
i should not have waited 'till now to say it, but I am.. that was stupid, okay?
I am sorry, but I am telling you now.
i love you.
do not get on this plane.
hey, hey.
i know you love me.
i know you do.
no, you do not.
no, you do not.
rachel?
i really thought she would stay.
oh my god!
let her off the plane!
try to understand!
no!
no!
oh my god.
did she get off the plane?
did she get off the plane?
you got off the plane.
i love you too, and I am never letting you go again.
me neither, okay?
we are - we are done being stupid.
this is it.
unless we are on a break.
do not make jokes now.
wow.
uh, i have not.
do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
well, technically it seven billion years ago… (well, technically you would be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of new york.)
okay!
okay!
fine, I will stop!
no teaching, okay?
we will just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.
(comets do not streak across the sky, meteors do.)
okay?
who is official name is bapstein-king.
man, look at all those stars!
(yeah, you can see what?
five of them from the city?)
infinite space.
it really, really makes you wonder, does not it?
huh?
what?
what?
is it the comet?
(runs over to where joey’s standing.)
joey come—i can not believe—i bring you here to see the bapstein-king comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
show me where?
(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) joey where is the pipe that was holding the door open?
joey!
it is called the bapstein-king comet, okay?
(joey starts to groan.)
hey!
hey!
bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
rachel!!
monica!!
i can not believe this!!
(standing at the edge of the roof) yeah, i guess we do not have a choice.
(screaming to the street) help us!
please help us!
we are stuck up on the roof and we can not get down!!!
(to joey) i know, i was not finished.
(joey motions him to finish.)
(yelling at the street) but do not worry!
we are going to go down the fire escape!!
ugh.
well, we are just going to have to jump.
(joey looks at him.)
yeah.
now, we are going to have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay?
not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle.
so, when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
yeah!
oh yeah, you will be fine!
it-it will be uh, just like bungy jumping.
y’know?
but instead of bouncing back up you-you will not.
well, I am going to lie to you joey, it is a possibility.
oh, all right.
(joey flips the coin.)
tails!
(the coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.)
can you-can you see what it is?
okay.
well, you be careful.
well I am jumping!
i have a son!
okay?
he will not have a father if-if i die!
(looking in the window behind them) y’know, y’know I am lookin’ and i do not think anyone’s home here.
i say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
i do not think so.
hello?
(knocks on the glass, which angers the big, large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.)
when you get in there… (joey nods his disapproval.)
okay, do-do you have a good grip?
okay, I am going to start climb down you now.
okay.
now-now-now should i climb down your front so we are face to face or-or should i climb down your back so we are-we are butt to face.
i would say that.
okay, here i go.
i prefer not to answer that right now, I am still carrying a little holiday weight.
so what do you want me to do?
hi.
(looking down) m-maybe i should hang and you can climb down me.
it is still looks pretty far!
do not rush me!!
oww!!
my ankle!
i really hurt my ankle!
i think i twisted it when i—ooh, a quarter!
nono, me neither.
although, uh, y'know, back in college, susan sallidor did.
no.
no, it is just because, uh, i kind of wanted to go out with her too, so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman... who also liked her, so... (to joey) so he is calling from rome.
i could do that.
just got to go to rome.
so, uh, how is she doing?
okay, relax, relax.
we are going to be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
oh!
...yeah, they were gross.
oh, you know what i loved?
her sweet 'n' los.
how she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
she looks so small.
well, at least she is with pop-pop and aunt phyllis now.
bye, nana.
y'know how-how the nurse said that-that nana had passed?
well, she is not, quite.. she is not- past, she is present, she is back.
i, uh, I will go see.
(he goes in) now she is passed.
twice.
i dunno, it is weird.
i mean, i know she is gone, but i just do not feel, uh... nono, she is gone.
i thought it was going to be a closed casket.
(sarcastic) i do not see why not.
here is my retainer!
(holding a dress out from inside the closet) this one?
i have shown you everything we have.
unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
oh!
a fine choice.
I am coming out.
(starts to climb over the furniture) okay.
um, how about these?
(holds out a pair) and where she is going everyone else'll be dressier?
(forages around) okay, i have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
i can show you something in a silver that may work.
no!
nonono, wait a sec.
i may have something in the back.
oh my god.. yeah, just... just nana stuff.
(entering) how we doing, you guys ready?
some days it is all i can think about.
what, we-uh- we do not have shoes here, or...?
oh, i hope they are not ruined.
i know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though nana's gone there is, there is something almost, uh- i dunno, almost life-aff- (not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave) I am fine.
just-just... having my worst fear realised... what, what is it?
oh!
no-n- i feel great.
i feel- great, i fleel great.
not the first two, but the second two- woooo!
...i love you guys.
you guys are the greatest.
i love my sister (kisses monica), i love pheebs... (hugs her) ...chandler!
(hugs him) and listen, man, if you want to be gay, be gay.
does not matter to me.
rachel.
rachel rachel.
(sits down beside her) i love you the most.
no.
oh.. you do not get it!
(passes out and slumps across her) that little naked guy would be me.
yes, yes, fine, that is my penis.
can we be grown-ups now?
got me.
looks like a fun gang.
(they all look at each other and smile) (looking) nono, that would be me again.
I am, uh, just trying something.
i could not possibly eat another bite.
huh, i do not know what to pick.
am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction?
hmm.
I am sorry.
it is just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever.
oh god, no.
you are right.
yours is worse.
you are the king of bad thanksgivings.
in this life, phoebe.
yeah that is the same.
(entering) hey!
uh, everyone, this is chandler!
my roommate and lead singer of our band!
oh, this is monica.
oh, mom.
mom.
chandler hates thanksgiving and does not eat any thanksgiving food.
so uh, rach?
does it, does it feel weird around here now?
y'know since I have been away at college.
well, that is cool.
so did… (she walks away from him and he shuts up.)
umm, I am sorry judy, i could not find that bowl that you and jack were looking for.
(in a high pitched voice) monica!
so I am thinking about asking rachel out tonight.
y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
yeah.
listen, roland chang, if things go well, I am going to be out with her all night.
all right, it is cool you can stay here.
my parents will not mind.
hey!
i can not believe you let george michael slap you.
hey.
(to his parents) happy thanksgiving!
so uh, where is monica?
dude!
oh mom!
okay, umm, her name is carol.
and she is really pretty.
and smart.
and uh, she is-she is on the lacrosse team and the golf team.
can you believe it?
she plays for both teams!
can you please not do that feet first?
you know where his injury is!
severed toe, you just said it!
(to joey) sir limps-a-lot, i came up with that.
yeah, and-and it is not that we do not like the comedian, it is that-that... that is not why we bought the ticket.
no, it is good, it is good, it is just that- mm- does not she seem a little angry?
does she.
marsha, these are cave people.
okay?
they have issues like 'gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.'
see?
(trying to ignore her) no.
no.
okay, okay, yes, it is.
(waves) how about I will, uh, catch up with you in the ice age.
i. you look great.
i, uh... i hate that.
ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... so what is new?
still, uh... well... you never know.
how is, um.. how is the family?
why- why are you here, carol?
pregnant?!
(standing outside the door).....hi.
carol's pregnant.
yeah.
do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now.
(he enters.)
well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved, but if I am not comfortable with it, i do not have to be involved.. basically it is entirely up to me.
anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
i have no idea.
no matter what i do, though, I am still going to be a father.
i- i think they are great!
i, i really do.
aw, mom... yeah.
(they go to the kitchen.)
(pulls his hand away) okay!
okay.
(to his parents) look, i, uh- i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me, and, so, well, here is the deal.
carol's a lesbian.
she is living with a woman named susan.
she is pregnant with my child, and she and susan are going to raise the baby.
well, y'know, these people are pros.
they know what they are doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
must pee.
(goes to pee.)
...how long was i in there?
d'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
anyway.. um.. (starts to sweep.)
so, you- uh- you nervous about barry tomorrow?
mm-hmm.. mm.
well, you may want to steer clear of the word 'dumped'.
chances are he is going to be this, this broken she will of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, i know it will be hard.
or, y'know, uh, hey!, I will go down there, and I will give barry back his ring, and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn... got me.
yeah.
yes, yes!
me either... (he pulls up a stool so that he does not have to move his hand.)
(entering) sorry I am late, i was stuck at work.
there was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
how could i forget?
(they shake hands) hello, susan.
(to carol) good shake.
good shake.
so, uh, we are just waiting for...?
..dr. oberman.
okay.
and is he- -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
okay, that is great.
(susan gives her drink to carol.)
no, I am- oh.
(picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) quack, quack.. so, um- so how is this, uh, how is this going to work?
y'know, with us?
y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
well, uh, uh, i do not know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
marlon?!
...as in mouse?
still, you- you say minnie, you hear mouse.
um, how about, um.. how about julia?
's'funny, um, uh, we agreed we would spend the rest of our lives together.
things change, roll with the punches.
i believe julia's on the table..?
helen geller?
i do not think so.
thank you!
what, it is going to be helen willick?
well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
oh, 's'funny, really?
um, i do not remember you making any sperm.
no no no, she gets a credit, hey, I am in there too.
of course not, I am... suggesting geller-willick-bunch.
my way?!
you-you think this is my way?
believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what?
uh, um, this is too hard.
I am not, i can not do- you- uh- y'know what, I am going to go.
i do not- i do not think i can be involved in this particular thing right now.
oh my god.
well?
is not that amazing?
then do not do that, alright?
(walks over to where monica is standing)monica.
whaddya think?
wh- are you welling up?
you are, you are welling up.
you are going to be an aunt.
no, it is really not that bad.
i mean, i-i for one, feel perfectly safe.

oh hey, that was a good one, huh?
(imitating himself) help!
help!
oh, liam.
so uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should i call it (in an english accent) football?
what is ah, what is so funny about that?
well, we did not have freedom here until 1776, either so… cheers!
oh, just hold on a second.
I am watching this rugby thing on espn.
i do not know what the big deal is.
I am man enough to play this sport.
(shocked) hey!
hey, i can handle it!
all right?
that is ‘because-‘because you are mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
and is a hum, kind of like a scruddle?
well, you should have seen the guy that she used to go out with.
i mean, he is like joe rugby.
anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious.
so I am going to show her how tough i really am!
look, do not worry about me.
okay?
I will just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball.
I will uh, I will be that guy right out of the circle.
(he points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
they do not look any bigger than me!
all right.
okay, i know what i have to do.
I have got to go red ross.
(joey and phoebe do not know what he is talking about.)
y’know, red ross!
come on!
the time we were all waiting in line for dances with wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and i just lost it?!
screamed at him!
turned all red!
red ross!!
you will see.
joey!!!!!!
did you see me?
i was pretty good, huh?
that is one fun game!
(to emily) hey, could you do me a favour?
could you just grab me a bottle of water?
thanks.
(when she is gone he collapses into joey.)
i-i think I am dying.
i really do.
(to phoebe) tell my son that i love him.
(emily returns with the water.)
excellent!
well, okay, i got to have some more fun!
(whines "no.")
that is not true!
what?
no!
no, I am not stopping.
I am red ross!
i do not care!
i am not quitting!
i insist on finishing this game!
no, god no!
that is no place for a woman.
those guys will grab anything.
i like that.
huh?

yeah?
i can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay!
okay!
but-but, liam’s on my team.

(squeals like a madman.)
oh no!
that-that will just bring me down!
this was great!
i mean i-i-i was great!
this is a great day!
y’know what?
I am buying everyone coffee.
all right?
if someone would just grab my wallet, it is in my pocket.
no, not you.
(emily gets it.)
oh, i kind of was, was not i?
i made a man twice my size cry.
i mean, i have not done that since i was four and i washed my dad’s porsche with rocks.
please!
are you kidding?
i-i hurt three huge men, i gave a guy a bloody nose—i mean i-I am not proud of it but, i really am.
and it is all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
no, no, I am serious.
thank you.
it is worth the pain.
(she goes to hug him again.)
y’know what, you know what?
it is not.
hey!
why did you say no?
just then or-or all the time, ‘because we-we have jobs y’know.
shhh!
we are not talking.
uh, double latte, extra foam.
(popping up behind joey wearing an indian headdress) come on, it is fun!
are you serious?!
wow!
we are pretty good at this!
hey!
we totally forgot about lunch!
it tastes like feet!
are you kidding?
(leaning into the recorder as well) who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
yeah, so far nothing stupid.
uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
yeah, you too.
all right I have been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because i want to be a good friend, and damnit i am a good friend.
so just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses joey).
wait a minute!
i saw that!
on the discovery channel, yeah!
about jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at monica) ewwww!!
you peed on yourself?!
your make-up!
okay.
now-now-now should i climb down your front so we are face to face or-or should i climb down your back so we are-we are butt to face.
i would say that.
okay, here i go.
i prefer not to answer that right now, I am still carrying a little holiday weight.
it really was.
hi jill.
amazing!
amazing!
wow!
this picture of you sure is steamy.
did you just wink at me?
that is too bad.
yeah?
what about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
yeah, i think she looks good.
go, go, go!
yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
no-of-of!
(rachel gives him a “please?” look.)
no way!
yeah well, if ah, if that is the rule this weekend... (she gets up) no!
get away!
stay away!
(he gets up and starts to run away from her) no!
(in his escape attempt he crushes chandler’s sand castle) no!
ow!
ow!
oh, no-no-no!
hey!
okay, (reading the card) fonzy gives you two thumbs up, collect two cool points.
yeah.
okay, come on!
(blows on the dice) daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the prehistoric forensics department!
(they all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.)
(he moves his piece) okay.
(reading a card) take pinky tuscadero up to inspiration point, collect three cool points!!
yeah!
which gives me five, and let us see who is going to lose their clothes.
ummmm, i think i pick our strip poker sponsor mr. joey tribianni.
whoa, hey!
what are doing?
trying to get me drunk?
okay.
hey!
(rachel is shocked) hi bonnie!
oh.
good morning.
(to joey) good morning.
nice breasts by the way.
uh, pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
wh-haa-haa!
look what ‘cha did!
(rachel has her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.)
nooo, but it, but it is great.
okay.
(he gently touches it.)
you can feel all the bones in your skull.
hi.
i was having a little chat with ah, bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it?
oh, that is right, that is right, it was you!
she said you gave her the razor!
ahh, no, I am good.
okay, have fun!
wooo!!
you can see the moonlight bouncing off her head!
what the hell were you thinking?!!
you do not know?!
rach, you balded my girlfriend!
y'know, hey!
you are the one who ended it, remember?
you still love me?
you still love me.
noo, nnnnn.
what does this mean?
what do you, i mean do you want to, get back together?
what?!
what?
that is not true!
her, she does not even know what she wants!
rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
i know, but ahhhhhh!!
i really want to go up there and finish that kiss!
good night.
okey-dokey!
hey, it will grow back, right?
and she-she is really fun, and she is cool, and-and I am finally moving on.
y'know?
i mean getting over rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know?
y'know, and I am finally feeling sane again.
and now if i go up there, and-and i kiss her, and, gooood i want to kiss her, and-and-and it does not work out, right?
do i really want to put myself through that again?
yeah.
(entering the bedroom) hi.
(closes the door) (entering) hey!
thanks?
but i have plans; elizabeth and i are going out of town.
yeah.
why?
what?
no, no, that is funny.
but maybe it is time to move on, let it go, y’know?
stop it!
besides, rachel is going out with elizabeth’s father, so ah, he is much older than she is.
looks like I am not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
okay, okay.
uh, well uh, rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (paul enters) in his ear.
oh, come on you guys; that is funny!
y’know?
because he is need—he is got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘because-‘because y’know, ‘because he is all old, and… really?
that okay, that is great.
all right look, i-i realize it upsets you.
but, elizabeth and i are-are both adults and so i do not think there is really anything you can do about it.
ohh!
a man with a plan!
this place is really beautiful!
wow!
the only thing i got from my grandmother was her eyes.
i mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—do-do you want to make out?
ehh, i was just, i was just thinking about your father.
no.
no-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
yeah.
(loudly) why?!
are there like bears or something?!
(looks around and then sees that elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what elizabeth meant.)
ohh.
oh, protection.
yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that i forgot.
oh no!
hey-hey, I am the guy!
I will get it.
no.
a little bit.
okay.
ohh, okay.
what are you doing here?!
yeah, i recognize the ankles!
(under the couch) you and your ice.
(before entering) did you really hear a bear?
elizabeth!
(he opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.)
okay.
okay.
(she helps him out.)
I am going to go out this window.
(points to the window next to him.)
I will meet you at the front door.
just tell them you are going home, okay?
(to elizabeth) and that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
okay, please-please paul, just let me explain… all right, fine!
fine!
have me fired!
but uh, i want you to know that you and i are not all that different.
i mean, i too am a neat guy.
(paul just looks at him.)
and i too am just a love machine.
(hums a little bit and mimics paul’s flexing.)
hey joey, how come our stuff is not free?
hey does anyone have any gum?
y’know what?
I am good!
I am good!
hey!
when you put a ‘d’ at the end of ‘fine’ you are not fine.
hi jill.
jill, how did you pay for all this?
i thought your dad took away your credit card.
i do not think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
sorry-sorry jill.
huh?
oh, i got this—(holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!
yeah!
oh, i-i love this babies!
ross, wants a pajmena?
it is a rug.
(jill winces.)
yeah.
everything but, the little blue one.
(holds it up for her.)
well.
hey… oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I am sorry!"
oh stop.
no, you stop!
(entering) rach?
hi!
did you tell your sister to ask me out?
oh wow!
i mean, wow!
i mean, i-i-i think she is cute but i-i would never have thought of going out with her, never!
yeah but after you said it was okay, i figured, "why not?!"
i have to say you are a much bigger person than i am.
i mean after all we have been through, i just—y’know i wish i had a brother to reciprocate.
hey, if you ever want to go out with monica, you have my blessing.
(entering) hi jill!
hi (sees rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
rachel!
well, you-you are not at home, you are-you are-you are right here.
okay.
so well I will umm, (to rachel) I will have her home by midnight.
hey, remember when i had a monkey?
yeah, what, what was i thinking?
what is up with the greed joe?
well is not there something you can do to earn a little extra money?
i mean, can not-can not you pick up, i do not know, an extra shift here?
oh, wait!
wait!
do not you have an audition today?
yeah!
maybe you will get that job!
hi!
hey, what have you guys been up to?
wow!
after one class?
i do not think so.
well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that is not enough.
look, i studying kara-tay for a long time, and there is a concept you should really be familiar with.
it is what the japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
no, it is a concept!
all right, maybe it means that too… y’know what?
fine!
get attacked!
i do not even care!
unagi is a state of total awareness.
okay?
only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
(moves closer) all I am saying is, it is one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, i do not know, like a (turns and puts his face close to rachel’s and screams) surprise!!
all right, you know that one was coming, but that does not mean you have unagi.
(does the finger thing.)
y’know what… (moves away as chandler enters, panicked.)
no.
so what are you going to do?
danger!!!
danger!!!!!
a lesson in the importance of unagi.
(he starts doing the finger thing every time now.)
perhaps.
now I am curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
I am sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but i—look, i just want you guys to be safe.
(monica comes out to throw out the garbage and ross screams…) danger!!!!!
(she completely ignores him and keeps walking.)
ahhh, huh?
unagi.
(not turning around) chandler.
i sensed it was you.
unagi.
I am always aware.
what is up?
oh, why do not you make her one of your little jokes.
y’know what?
she would-she would love this.
(picks up a model of the saturn v rocket, that is the one that took man to the moon.)
uh, it is an exact replica of apollo 8. i made it in the sixth grade.
yeah-yeah, except apollo 8 did not actually land on the moon.
but you-you-you could write that umm, your love let us me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
(apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the christmas story from the orbit of the moon on christmas eve, 1968. they also took the famous earthrise picture of the earth rising over the moon.)
why not?
oh.
it is not something you are!
it is something you have!
y’know what?
i can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
it is a great class.
yeah, yeah, i was watching.
(the instructor just nods and walks away.)
umm, hey, a couple of questions though.
umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
no.
no-no.
no.
what would you do next?
yes that is right.
i tired attacking two women, did not work.
no, i mean it is okay, i mean, they are-they are my friends.
in fact, i-i-i was married to one of them.
oh, no!
no-no!
no, i tired!
but i could not.
that is why I am here.
maybe we could attack them together?
(he glares at him.)
that-that is a no.
ah-ha, nowhere to run!
(he starts to run towards them.)
danger!!!!
(to rachel) yeah, i still do not know.
(to the salesman who is hovering nearby) I am sorry i just want to make sure that i bought the right couch.
i need a couch that says, "kids welcome here."
but that also says, (in a sexy voice) "come here to me!"
no!
no!
no!
the "come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
yeah?
oh, sure.
whoa-whoa, what is this?
the delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
yeah, y'know what?
I will take it myself, thank you!
(he signs the form and hands it back to the salesman.)
all right rach, let us go!
(he picks up one end of the couch.)
oh, come on it is only three blocks!
and-and, it is not very heavy, try it!
come on!
come on!
yeah!
oh yeah, we are uh, yeah we are not together.
(he starts backing out of the store.)
what is that supposed to mean?
not that it is any of your business, but we did go out.
yeah!
rach?
then tell him quickly.
not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
a loser you did it with (to the salesman) 298 times!
okay.
(throws off the last cushion.)
uhh, yes i did but there is not.
okay, here we go.
okay, go left.
left!
left!
(the bottom of the couch is hitting the railing.)
oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!
straight up over your head!
you can do it!
you can do it!
(she gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.)
okay.
you got it?
good-good-good.
yeah, you got it right?
you got it right?
you got it?
come here to me.
no-no, you come here to me.
oh great!
what, you brought joey?
chandler?!
you brought chandler?!
the next best thing would be monica!
look, i-i drew a sketch about how we are going to do it.
(showing them) okay rach, (points to the sketch) that is you.
that is the couch.
(points again.)
oh, that is me.
no!
that is-that is my arm!
y'know what?
just-just follow my lead.
come on, chandler.
all right.
(they start up the stairs.
ross is first.)
okay, here we go!
all right, ready?
turn.
turn!
turn!
oh yeah it will!
come on, up!
up-up-up!
up!
yes!
here we go!
pivot!
(they start up the stairs again.
chandler is between the couch and the wall now.)
pivot!
piv-ot!
piv-et!!
piv-ett!!!
piv-et!
okay, i do not think it is going to pivot anymore.
all right, let us uh, let us bring it back down and-and try again.
i can not believe that did not work!
I would like to return this couch.
I am not satisfied with it.
that is what I am telling you.
this couch, is cut in half!
i would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
look, i am a reasonable man.
i will accept store credit.
(thinks) i take it.
look i was going to tell you!
okay, maybe it was not my best decision.
but i just could not face another failed marriage.
rach, come on, if you think about it, it is actually kind of funny.
(he laughs, and he laughs alone.)
okay, maybe it is best not to think about it.
phoebe, i told her you already knew.
okay, i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and i picked up all the forms.
I will take care of everything.
okay rach, but… look i told you… look, if you would had two failed marriages, you would understand!
what about the time i said we were on a break?
fine, I am mentally unstable.
what?!
crack is not even an intravenous drug!
oh, come on!
okay, I am sorry, this is insane!
i-i-I am not addicted to heroin, I am not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything!
look, I will consummate this marriage right here, right now!
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
(stands up) that is great!
are you happy now?
look what you did with your funny, funny form!
and what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—what are you typing that for?
did you hear what she said?
we do not get the annulment.
do not type that!
what?!
stop typing!
(he goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes rachel out of his way.)
hey!
stop typing!
(he is still typing.)
stop typing!
stop typing!!
yeah!
my fault?!
you threatened the judge!
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing!
the judge would not let us get an annulment!
now we got to get a divorce!!
did a porsch throw up on you?
(walks on.)
i picked up the divorce papers.
uh, I have already signed everything and i put little ‘x’s where you need to sign.
y’know, i-i—you have done a lot of stupid stuff too!
okay?
okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding!
ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married!
yeah!
right!
you are right.
that is very different.
so let us, let us just sign the papers.
all right?
(sits down and rachel keeps standing there.)
what?
okay, can we just sign please?
congratulations.
(gets up to leave.)
what?
excuse me?
yeah?
so then if-if—i mean if you think about it, this is all (pause.)
your fault.
I have got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you.
did i, did i even treat?
that may be the most depressing thing I have heard in my life.
i should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
eh, no problem.
totally.
(exits.)
come on, i think this is a good thing.
i do not think mom would have hired you if she did not think you were good at what you do.
…I am telling you it is totally unconstituional.
the volcano?
with such a sad history.
oh thanks.
although it kind of seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
yeah, a lot of my students do that.
okay, i-I will see you tonight.
okay, bye.
ah, it is good.
it is going good.
i mean, we get along great.
she is, she is so… well, i was going to say sweet, but yeah-huh!
well i…i have not actually told her yet.
i do not want to scare her off, y’know?
sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
(joey nods his agreement.)
uh actually, sorry i can not even make it.
I am seeing mona again tonight.
uh that is an eighteenth century indian artifact from calcutta.
so much more.
aw forget it, it is from pier one.
(there is an angry knock on the door.)
sorry.
(goes and opens the door to an irate dr.
green.)
y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
who did?!
yes.
yes, yes i did.
(to mona) but-but it was, it was just a one night thing.
it meant nothing.
no!
no sir umm, she means a lot to me.
i mean, i care—i-i love rachel.
(to mona) oh but not that way.
i mean…i mean I am not in love with her.
i love her like a, like a friend.
(to dr. green) hey!
i offered to marry her!
(to mona) but i did not want to.
I am sorry.
dr. green, mona.
mona, dr. green.
i was going to tell you, but… hey!
i did not dump rachel!
(to mona) nor are we still together.
(the phone rings and ross goes to answer it, only he is trapped behind the apothecary table by dr.
green.)
can i just… (dr. green glares at him.)
why do not we just let the machine get that?
no!
no!
no!
no!
no!
i-i-i-i—i need to, i need to lie down.
so your dad dropped by.
he is a pleasant man!
i do not care about your dad!
i care about mona!
she was there and now she is totally freaked out!
rachel!
okay!
thank you!
thank you so much for coming back over.
focus.
yeah.
trying to date this woman.
probably should not touch me.
should i leave this open for you too?
because what is going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you.
i know and i was going to, but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachel’s father.
look i…i made a mistake, but it is only because i really, really like you.
really!
hey!
wow!
you look nice.
what is the occasion?
wow!
how did you get in there?
what the hell was that?!
the flirting!
are not you supposed to be going out with, i do not know hmm, let us say my sister?!
it was totally flirting.
"somebody got a haircut (makes some whiney, nasally noises.)"
yeah, right.
(backing away) I am good.
and on your anniversary, for shame!
chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
well I am sorry but you were!
okay?
and besides if anyone should be hitting on her it is the guy who is single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
well… well, i-i was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
and she is just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little… this is perfect!
she will have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I will turn on the charm-of-ross.
oh I am so glad you do not eat meat.
I will get it!
i will get that!
(runs over and opens the door.)
hi!
oh.
uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better.
i happen to like 8-year-old boys.
(i can not make it out.)
the uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I am just saying i like it.
the hair.
you understand i do not actually like 8-year-old boys.
you could not let me have her, could ya?!
this is a girl that i really like and had too swoop in there!
chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
really?!
and thank you, for that.
what?
(mumbles) what-what, what are talking about?
it-it worked with you.
all right, all right.
you-you-you know what I am going to do?
i am going to order another pizza and when caitlin gets here, you-you--i will show how well i flirt.
yeah!
i will, i will get her phone number!
(to chandler) and not the one on the menu!
(smiling) are you sure?
(to phoebe) hey pheebs!
how is that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya?
you and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
do you like it?
okay, I am working on my flirting.
joey!

(running to the door) oh, mine!
mine!
mine!
(to everyone) okay, here goes.
prepare yourselves for some class a flirting.
you will see.
okay.
(readies himself.)
oh, what is-what is her name?
(he opens the door while faking a laugh.)
hey!
oh, we-we can not keep eating like this.
(monica turns her head in shame.)
okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
gas?
wow!
intense.
(to caitlin) hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
they put that in.
the gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there is a leak.
a lot of other gas smells… meth-methane smells… oh but i-i-i have not paid you yet!
(to all) was i talking to her about gas?
look, no-no, hey, hey, do not worry about it!
in nine years, she and i will be right there.
(goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
yeah?
what do you mean?
and she just gave you this?
rach, thanks but uh, i do not need you doing me any favors.
well that i can believe.
(to phoebe) and she is supposed to buy this?!
hm-mmm.
neither will i.
(they both put back the brownies.)
so what is a matter, you need a dentist?
I have got a good one.
why?
why can not you go to him?
pheebs, come on, you did not kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
it is, it is, it is just ah, a coincidence.
thanks, gunther.
(takes the plate gunther serves him and rachel comes up and kisses him) (to rachel) hey!
(to gunther) umm, can i get a napkin too?
(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) no, no he is not.
what?
(to joey) so what are you going to do?
i mean how, how are you going to tell chandler?
okay, i have a problem i have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the homo sapien display.
well, they painted over the word ‘sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let us just leave it at that.
yes, that is what i was going to ask, thank you.
you?
you!
want to watch ben?
(in the background monica mouths ‘do not worry, I will be here the whole time.’ to ross.)
yes!
that would be great, no, i just wanted to ask monica, because i know how empty her life is.
(monica sarcastically mouths ‘yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)
yeah.
hmm?
joey, homo sapiens are people.
(entering) hey!
everyone.
how is my little boy?
(noticing the outfit he is wearing) what did you do, take him whaling?
oh my god, he just said your name, that is great!
good job ben.
and tell them what?
the naked guy we stare at all the time is not moving.
well, he is finally alseep.
about that ah, bump on his head?
it is okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, i figured you did the best you could.
i know!
I am saying you have to watch them all the time.
monica did it?
monica?
umm, did you notice anything wierd about ben today?
well, i was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he is leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ it is like they just ah, i do not know, fell out of his head.
oh, and also, he is, he is walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he is in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle) monica bang!
monica bang!
(runs into one of the posts) ow!
can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
he does not look happy.
oh, where are you guys going?
ah.
joey you are-you are having lunch with my mom?
(to chandler) y’know what?
actually I am kind of glad they are leaving ‘because uh, i need to talk to you about something.
well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
no, its…its not that.
umm, now what I am going to say to you, I am not saying as your friend.
okay?
I am-I am saying as it as monica’s older brother.
not for the next few minutes.
nope.
okay!
you guys are getting married tomorrow and-and i could not be more thrilled for both of you, but as monica’s older brother i-i have to tell you this.
if you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever because her any unhappiness of any kind, i will hunt you down, and kick your ass!
(chandler laughs.)
what?
I am-I am-I am serious!
(chandler laughs harder.)
come—hey!

okay?
I am-I am not kidding here!
no problem.
yeah.
(walks up) wow monica!
hey, just so you know i had my uh, older brother chat with chandler.
well i…i told him that if he ever hurt you i would hunt him down and kick his ass!
(the girls all laugh.)
what?!
what?!
what is the matter with everybody?!
i am serious!
i would kick his ass!
(the laugh harder.)
thanks you guys.
(walks away happily and his parents smile.)
(clinking a wine glass) can i have everyone is attention please?
I am uh; I am ross geller.
dad…dad, please!
as i was saying umm, I am dr. ross geller.
uhh, and I am the best man.
and uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister.
and, she is the greatest sister a guy could ask for.
so if you would all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we are here to celebrate.
(everyone does so.)
to the bings.
oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
what?
are you going back to work?
nice shades.
and if i remember correctly, ray ban was the official sponsor of world war i!
hey, where is chandler?
(going up to rachel’s closed door) chandler?
(he opens the door and looks inside and does not see him.)
chandler?
(he checks the bathroom and still does not find him.
he then finds a note on the counter.
he picks it up and reads it.)
hey!
is uh, is monica here?
i think chandler’s gone.
(he hands her the note.)
he left that.
i think it means he freaked out and left!
look—okay, I am just going to—I am going to have to go find him and bring him back!
okay?
you-you make sure monica does not find out, okay?
(scared) i will, i will find him.
gunther have you uh, have you seen chandler?
oh damn!
yes.
yes.
do not worry.
everything’s fine.
we will uh, we will see you tomorrow at the wedding.
well then we will-we will see you the day after tomorrow.
(walks away slowly, but notices something.)

(they are sitting by the window.)
what-what…what you guys doing here?!
why?!
(shocked) gunther?!
what?
your-your list?
yes!
no-no!
i know, i know what the list is!
mom!
look if you see chandler, could you just let him know I am looking for him?
no!
i talked to joey on the set, he has not heard from him.
i-i-i talked to chandler’s parents again!
no!
i made it seem like i was just calling to chat.
pretty sure, they both think I am interested in them.
no!
hey!
hey!
we can not!
well, can not you at least stall her a little?
I will-I will go back to some of the places i went last night.
well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
give me two.
okay, wish me luck.
why?!
we are never going to find him!
he is one guy in a huge city!
that is an old, chinese woman!
aw, y’know…y’know, maybe we are-we are just approaching this all wrong.
if you are chandler and-and you want to hide, where is the last place on earth people would think you would go?
so this is your office?
she is fine.
she does not know you are gone.
and she does not have to know, okay?
now come on, we are going home.
what is wrong with being the bings?
chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
then you are neither of your parents!
y’know, okay.
you are right.
it is huge.
so why do not we take it just a little bit at a time?
okay?
umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it.
can you just come home and take a shower?
(interrupting him) yeah—no-but-but-but-but!
we are just going to go home and take a shower.
now, that is not scary right?
there you go.
you put on a tuxedo!
now that was not so scary, was it?
I am telling you, just a little bit at a time.
getting married.
(chandler panics.)
okay.
okay.
you can, you can do that too!
just like you have done everything else!
yeah.
wh—hey—whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!

(to mrs. bing) hi!
(mr. bing starts rubbing his arm.)
hi.

hide and seek.
(pause) you are right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.

(chandler lies back down.)
I am serious!

(hugs him.)
huh.
this is nice.
I have never walked down the aisle knowing it can not end in divorce.
rings?
hi!
oh, I will have some!
take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
oh my god, the wedding book?!
i have not seen that since the forth grade!
and that should conclusively prove that i had the idea for jurassic park first!
now let us take a look at… (phoebe rushes in.)
phoebe, oh my god!
wh-wh-what are you doing here?
oh my god!
of course, of course.
(to the class.)
umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
umm, do you know each other’s hometowns?
why do not you… (motions that they should learn everyone is hometown.)
(to phoebe) wh-what is going on?
umm, okay, yeah, sure.
but wh-what is wrong with monica and chandler?
phoebe, you said it was urgent!
do you realize i have a classroom full of students?
uh, phoebe… phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe!
phoebe, you can not massage people in my apartment!
and they knew about it?
look, this is my home and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want!
the big deal is i do not want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when i want to kick back with a puzzle—beer!
cold beer.
hello.
uh no-no, she-she is out for the night.
can i, can i help you with something?
(deadpan) yes i am.
okay!
now, I am going to touch you.
(he does so, very gingerly.)
ohh, that is soft.
(he starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)
(sitting down) hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
(takes a drink) damn, this coffee’s cold!
hey rach, do you mind if i heat this up on your loins?
(joey and he both laugh.)
so i guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
(chases her) oh yeah, yeah?
well uh, when we were going out, i read tons of porno magazines!
(realizes a table of women overheard him.)
(to that table.)
‘sup?
(looking at the table) excuse me ladies.
(to phoebe) I am sorry?
(incredulous) i gave him an extremely professional massage!
okay, so it was not uh, a traditional massage.
but i did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks.
and, and i gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
hey, y’know what?
this is your fault!
you are the one that did not move his-his appointment.
he said he liked that!!
oh you are right, you are right.
I am sorry.
his daughter was hot.
(entering) will!
hey-hey you came!
man you look incredible!
hot stuff!
(they hug and ross realizes what he said.)
hot stuff?
yeah, you too.
man, so-so what are you up to?
really?
yeah that-that sounds interesting.
oh!
man i do not think I have seen you since uh, lance davis’ graduation party.
yeah.
it would have been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
yeah.
(laughs) yeah.
so how long are you in town?
aw—oh, that is right.
are-are you going to be okay?
will, high school was-was a long time ago.
no need to point, she knows who ross is.
no.
no.
uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from thailand but i-i do not think he-he knew what it was.
that was in high school!
it is not like it was binding forever.
look rach i-I am sorry, okay?
i…i was a stupid kid, okay?
the only reason i joined… …co-founded.
co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you.
obviously i did not handle it very well.
but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club.
no-no!
no-no.
no-no.
it was no big deal.
we-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
actually, billy tratt is gay now.
so-so that one’s not really our fault.
rach, i think you are reading a little too much into it.
look, what do you want me to do?
do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it was not true?!
well look-look I am not calling anybody!
okay?
it was like a million years ago!
what?
(shocked) (to rachel) how did you know that?!!!!
no.
hey!
she did not look 50!
she did not photograph well!
i was working late in the library one afternoon.
it was just the two of us.
she needed some help with her word jumble.
and one thing led to another.
if you must know, anita was very gentle and tender.
may she rest in peace… only when it was damp!!
(to rachel) i can not believe you-you told people about this?!
everybody knew?!
y’know what?
(to will) I am back in the club!
as a romancer of the elderly.
the eyes…did still sparkle.
yeah.
i mean we are having a baby together.
yeah.
nope.
(entering) hey!
what are you guys doing later?
(continuing) i just found out that elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.
come on guys, i-i really want this guy to like me.
it-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
thanks!
it-it is great to meet you paul.
of course, of course, mr. stevens.
eh-wh—excuse me?
that is funny.
umm….
(pause, then serious) it is not funny.
okay.
i can, i can see that.
umm, but i think if you give me umm, one chance i can, i can change your mind.
what?
this is—you—(ross starts laughing.)
okay, umm i want you to know that i have never done anything like this before.
i mean, i mean I have been in um, relationships in general, uh but i have never done it with a student—i mean i not—not it!
i mean, i mean i do not—we have not done it.
uh, i mean, i mean, we have-we have-we have done stuff.
(paul is not amused.)
okay, okay, a joke, a joke—lighten the mood.
umm, two guys go into a bar.
one of them is irish.
and the irish guy wins the joke!
oh god, thank you!
(runs and gives all of them a group hug.)
umm, uh, mr. stevens I would like you to meet my friends uh, this is phoebe, monica, and chandler.
okay umm, why do not we all take a seat, y’know?
and uh, and I will get us all some uh some coffees—(he goes to pull out elizabeth’s chair, but paul steps in)—yeah, why do not you.
(paul pulls out her chair) uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want.
y’know?
whatever pops into your head.
(he turns his back to paul and elizabeth and points to himself for chandler, monica, and phoebe.
then he goes to order the coffee.)
(returning with the coffee) okay here we are paul, elizabeth.
(he sets down their cups.)
so i hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
joey?!
joey?!
joey!!
(he runs into his bedroom.)
okay, I will just wait for him in here!
(coming out of the bedroom) oh!
oh my god!
i did not even see you!
what-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
(incredulous) in your mouth?!
you were at the coffeehouse!
he is my girlfriend’s father, okay?
it is-it is, it is weird!
that was different!
this is weird for me!
how is that important?
yeah, take your time.
(to paul) just-just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior.
so it was not as bad as-as… not all bad.
yeah.
you know what?
i know what you mean; i do that too.
no!
no!
not—i do not mean i-i see her as a twelve-year-old girl!
i mean i-i have a son, who is umm six and i still think of him as a baby.
yeah, well my-my ex-wife and i share custody of ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, carol and i are on excellent terms as I am sure you are with your wife!
(realizes) oh, I am sorry!
(to elizabeth) it is unbelievable!
you are back.
y’know what?
i-i-i… i-i have had enough of this!
y’know, i-i-i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect!
so if-if you have got a problem with me, frankly… god no!
well if it does not matter to her, it does not matter to me!
(to paul) still not yelling!
that is okay, I am not so crazy about myself right now either.
uh yeah, i guess—yeah!
i guess so.
ohhh!
kids!
that is okay rach, we are not liking ross right now.
so, i just finished this fascinating book.
by the year 2030, there will be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain.
so theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
hi!
(rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
so uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
thank you for bringing her into our lives.
yeah, yeah man do not do it.
i mean if you date her, then-then-then i can not date her.
monica had such a crush on him.
yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
yeah.
hey!
(enters) wow, couples who live together do start to look alike.
so, mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?
did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
put it back exactly where you found it?
‘kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
whoa, hello, did you just meet monica?
hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well.
because when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right.
believe me, i lived with her for 16 years.
she is going to freak…out.
oh my god, she is going to sit on you.
yeah, the phone was facing the other way.
(chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.)
and that goes back up there.
yeah that-that, does not look right.
whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch will not line up with he back of the carpet.
whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table will not be centered in the seating area.
hey, I have been married 3 times look, we do not repel women ok?
that is completely untrue.
yeah, well what about you?
you were not you know, so hot in college either.
after everything he said, he would go "ba dum bum chessh" oh y'know what, girls do not like it when i start talking about science.
uh, they do not like it when you correct their grammar.
they do not like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
(nonchalantly) I am never going to find love again.
who cares?
i repel women.
(whispers) what?!
why does anyone have to be naked?
i-i had to show chandler something?
yeah-yeah i uh, i have a uh, a guy problem.
dude, what did you have?
(realizes something) the photo album!
there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
we just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
so really, what did ya have?
bye!
(runs out) so it said that by the year 2030, there will be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer... that is so janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we are doing right now?
you and i, we are interfacing.
hi!
oh great!
hey-hey joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and mona ice skating?
hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
wow!
that is a good one!
wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
(pause) together?
like-like to people?
okay.
(not happy about it.)
uh sure, sure.
i know.
can you believe that?
married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards!
what-what is she crazy?!
hey!
huh.
wow, this is great.
well, we-we have not said that to each other yet, but i guess its okay to say it to other people.
a hundred?!
well, i-i guess I will take a—mona, uh…i-I am not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
sending out a holiday card, together, i mean i just do not know if we are really quite there yet.
yeah.
huh.
hmm… let us do the card!
the card!
i think we are there!
really?!
i mean, even with the card?
(entering) hey!
oh yeah, yeah we are moving forward.
you will be getting our card!
yeah, we are not just doing a card!
y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
i know!
i know!
why do you guys need to have this conversation?!
huh?
i mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "so, where is this going?"
hey!
you were a closed book!
okay?
I am not a mind reader!
besides, i hate those conversations.
I am horrible at them.
really!
maybe-maybe i need kind of a gesture.
y’know, something that says we are moving forward without having to talk about it.
smaller than that.
uh, bigger than that.
whoa-hello!
we were closer with the mixed tape.
yeah i-i do not-i do not think I am quite there yet, but i could say i looove spending time with you.
forget it.
i-i—y’know what?
I will just have the conversation.
I will just say i like things the way they are, and hope for the best.
what do you think rach?
here we go.
mona umm, i think it is time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
aw, we-we are so…(motions that they are connected.)
so umm, well i-i-i like you and i-i love umm, y’know hanging out with you.
and i mean-I am having a lot of fun.
(he pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there is not.)
i mean, there is no point in spending time with someone if-if it is just fun.
it is got to be, it is got to be going somewhere right?
so where-where is it going?
(pause) ah!
that is-that is the real question.
and-and the answer is…is it is going somewhere…fun.
now i-i know what you are thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you are-you are not getting any younger.
no i mean—no not you, not you, you—you are getting younger.
i mean—you-you look like you are getting younger by the second—what is your secret?
well, well to sum up, we are having fun, you look young.
but that is not enough.
so… so…here is a key to my apartment.
(hands her his key.)
really.
not just a key, i gave her the only key!
i am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
oh great, i live on the street.
okay, and oh I am going to need a bunch of extra keys.
apparently i give them away for no reason at all.
no.
that guy is.
I am trying to tell you i made you a mix tape.
i love you!
just admit it chandler, you have no backhand.
shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
all right here.
watch me execute the three ‘p’s of championship play.
power.
(swings the racquet) precision.
(swings the racquet.)
and penache.
(does a backswing and hits sarah who is started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)
i know.
i feel horrible.
okay.
well, I am going to go see her.
i want to bring her something, what do you think she will like?
all right, see you guys.
(starts to leave) so, this must be kind of neat for ya, huh?
i mean, your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, do not have to sell those cookies anymore.
wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india.
huh.
well, good luck to dad.
say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
yeah.
four hundred, huh?
well, that sounds do-able.
(starts to get out his wallet) how much are the boxes?
(puts away his wallet) and what is second prize?
well, that makes sense.
yeah, sarah, anything.
hi, I am selling brown bird cookies.
no, hi, I am, I am an honorary brown bird (does the brown bird salute.)
ah, well, it means that i can sell cookies, but I am not invited to sleep-overs.
no, please, please, um, it is for a poor little girl who wants to go to spacecamp more than anything in the world.
okay, okay!
I am going.
I am going.
(goes across the hall to knock on another door.)
all right!!
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite christmas characters, santa, rudolph, and baby jesus.
wait a minute, one box!
come on, I am trying to send a little girl to spacecamp, I am putting you down for five boxes.
chandler, what about you?
no, but ah, there is coconut in the hanukkah menoreoes.
i tell you what, I will put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
mon?
ah, no mon, dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all.
but ah, y'know I am sure that is not going to happen this time, why do not i put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the rudolph’s.
oh, come on, now you know you want ‘them.
I will tell you what mon, I will give you the first box for free.
come on!
all the cool kids are eating ‘them!
(chases after her.)
....and 12, 22, 18, four... (chandler starts laughing) what?
ah, we are out.
i sold them all.
monica, I am cutting you off.
mon, look at yourself.
you have cookie on your neck.
check this out.
five hundred and seventeen boxes!
okay, the other night i was leaving the museum just as ‘laser floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying i sold 50 boxes!
that is when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ so i ah, started hitting the nyu dorms around midnight.
i am selling cookies by the case.
they call me: 'cookie dude!'
well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
well you sure used a large font.
sweetie, calm down, it is going to be okay.
what, that was not the great news?
(to the girl sitting next to him) hi there.
how many, how many ah, did you sell?
hey now!
that was an accident, okay.
what is a scrud?
i do not have too.
i can just look at you.
(to himself) not nice enough.
(to himself) good for a scrud.
that is crap!!
sister brown bird.
(to elizabeth) good going.
(does the salute) hi there!
um, that is because my doctor says that i have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
well, i lost.
some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the you.s.s.
nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
oh, come here sweetie, listen, you are going to go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
(she glares at him) that is not how that was supposed to come out.
that word was swans.
no.
I am, I am sorry you did not get to go to spacecamp, and I am hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it.
presenting sarah tuttle’s private very special spacecamp!!
(opens the door and chandler and joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)
oh come on!
here we go!
(picks her up and puts her in the chair) stand by for mission countdown!
oh no!
an asteroid!
(throws the soccer ball off the back of joey’s head.)
(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) well hello!
she is cute!
should we uh, go try to talk to her?
uh yeah!
let me, let me get that for you.
(exhales) i got it.
(he lifts the box and grunts under the strain.)
(calmly) so hi, I am uh, I am ross and this is my friend chandler.
(he shyly waves.)
kristen, hi.
are you uh, new to the area, ‘because if you are…I would love to show you around sometime.
ah.
y’know actually it does have a very interesting history.
uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.
(kristen crinkles her nose at that.)
before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street.
yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
(he stops when he realizes what he is talking about.)
umm, say you are going to be starving after all this moving.
what do you say i take you to dinner tonight?
yeah?
great!
uh, let me take this up for you.
(the box he is holding.)
oh no-no, after you.
(she grabs a chair and heads upstairs.)
(when she is gone.)
oh my god!
(he drops the box and chandler can not pick it up.)
laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she would like to go out again.
yeah in fact, I am going to go call her right now.
and I will make sure to tell her my friend chandler says… (he mimics the shy reaction chandler did.)
(returning) hey.
oh great!
we are going out again saturday.
but i just found she is also seeing some other guy.
well you should not be.
believe me i would not want to be the guy who is up against you.
(chandler laughs.)
i mean that doofus is going to lose!
well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
well now let us-let us look at this objectively, i think i should date her… that is interesting, but check this out.
i date her… okay, okay.
this can go on for a while.
no joey!
look why do not, why do not we just let her decide?
okay?
hey-hey, we will each go out with her one more time.
and-and we will see who she likes best.
maybe I will take her to that new french restaurant down the street… well sorry, that is what i do on dates.
so let us decide on the spending limit… i was thinking more like a hundred.
hey!
what is up?
oh thanks!
we have 8:00 reservations at grammercy bistero.
i am dressed.
i have an oily t-zone!
that is right.
uh actually, i sent the flowers before the actual date.
so techincally, technically i did not break any rules.
thanks for stopping by though.
oh yeah?
what are you going to do?
why am i not surprised?
i do not think you have much choice.
bye-bye!
yes.
yes.
just here (runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (runs his fingers across his forehead).
so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
yeah.
oh yeah it is fine.
i guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
hi.
(they shake hands.)
it is nice to meet you.
i used to have a friend named joey.
i do not anymore.
yeah.
so… so joey umm, you look familiar.
are uh, are you on tv or something?
that is right!
that is right, do not you play a woman?
much better.
well yes, yes i have.
in fact umm, just the other day kristen and i were talking about how I have been married and how i have a son.
that is right!
wait no, ben.
well umm… yes.
and another time after that.
boy I am getting hungry!
hey joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
wait a minute!
were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
hey you leave marcel out of this!
hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a tv cabinet vd boy?!
probably around gonorrhea.
yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we are going to have younger looking skin!
oh, that is right!
(to emma) daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today.
we are going to a conference in barbados, right?
(to emma) can you say barbados?
ok, i got to say.
i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech!
uh!
and I have a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference!
that is right!
(he gives them their passes) this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
oh, right, because he is a scientist!
ok, we got to go, yeah?
so, we will see you guys tomorrow.
it is a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
(very excited) look at all these paleontologists!!
wow!
this is very flattering, uh... uh, uh... sure!
uhm... "dear..." (he takes the notepad) "... sarah.
i dig you", uh?
"doctor ross geller".
yeah, oh and sarah...
I would like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, professor wheeler, a-and this is joey tribbiani.
dude, it is just "days of our lives"... there is no the.
hey!
(excited) you are never going to guess who i just saw downstairs!
yeah, she never misses these conferences!
(then to charlie) no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz!
yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz?
(to charlie) ready to go?
yeah.
(a little embarassed by their conversation) I am good, i have dinner plans (moves away from them).
uh, joe, have you looked outside?
by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century.
oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i will not be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet.
(someone knocks on the door, ross goes to open and it is joey, rachel and chandler).
the chocolates are not here yet.
if you want to check your email, just ask!
(chandler tries to look offended) wha... what do you mean?
(goes to the laptop) what, oh my god.
what did you do?
why, why would you open it?
what did it say?
what... what am i going to do?
my speech is gone, chandler!
no!
i do not!!
yep!
I would like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
yeah, well you should!
i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova?
i mean, she is never even won a major tournament!
get out!
(chandler runs out) well, what do you do?
i can not believe this.
i can not believe this is happening.
i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow!
ok?
i have to stand up in front of all these people.
what am i going to say?
i do not think that your monologue from star wars is going to help me right now, joe!
wha... what you really think we can do that?
alright, ok, let us do it.
(ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) uhm, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello!
(rachel and joey look confused) and then, there is the... eh... there is the overview of the triassic.
yeah, that is it?
oh my god, we did it!
(he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly) yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products.
this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.
(he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) that is a pretty necklace.
hey, what do you say we celebrate?
champagne?
(he goes to get the champagne) oh my god, i love you.
that is ben, my son from my first marriage.
yeah.
no.
(they clink glasses and drink) (embarassed) oh, it was... it is complicated, you know?
she... she was... eh... gay.
ok, odd thing to get excited about!
hey!
high-five!
(they high-five) my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year.
she did not get any fitter.
i know!
it is like, if you knew, why did not you tell me, you know?
i mean, call, or leave a note: "hi, i just dropped by to say your wife's gay" and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
(embarassed) me neither.
yep, we got it, we got it.
(to charlie) thank you so much.
good night.
(from across the wall) walls are pretty thin, guys!
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus... and that is just the herbivores.
I am not even going to discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big.
which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus... ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus... (concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century.
(pauses) thank you!
oh, thanks guys!
oh!
(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something is wrong with jarvis) ok... now... now we are just holding hands!
(pulls his hand away) oh, thank you so much!
(puzzled) ok!...
all right, thanks!
thank you so much, you guys!
(to phoebe) oh, i can not tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
(skating over, embarrassed) ok!...
uh... excuse me?
yeah?
hey!
(she turns to him) well...?
(in expectation) yeah?
oh, i can not tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
i mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
no, it is ok!
made me feel like a rock star!
(joking) I would better not found you naked in my hotel room!
(realizing his joke was not so good, but still giggling) look, i took it too far!
ooh, well.
ah, i kind of have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i would not love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
(mr. oberblau giggles) get out!
yes, please!
(they move and sit down on a sofa) so, what is going on?
oh my god, wh-what happened?
i knew that was him!
(holding her hand) hey, you ok?
oh, professor clerk we are kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
(standing) ok, gentlemen!
please!
are not we a little old for this?
i mean, we are scientists, right?
we are academics.
and most importantly i... you-you will have to catch us first.
(he starts to run away with charlie).
go, go, go!
(the paleontologists starts chasing them) hi.
yeah.
the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.
(pause) you know, we as a group are not the coolest.
i do not think they saw us.
(apparently unruffled) oh.
can i... can i ask who?
i think i know too but I have been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
I am sorry... we... we can not.
i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it would be a really really bad idea.
(pause) or-or not!
(they kiss passionately) hey!
you kissed her.
hey!
you like it?
it is my new apothecary table!
well why not?!
she will-she will love it!
it is the real thing!
i got it at pottery barn.
why did you do that?
she hates pottery barn?!!
what?
no!
no!
i am not going to hide it from phoebe—ooh, although i did get some great pottery barn sheets!
(gets them.)
uh, yeah!
i still can not believe she hates pottery barn!
yeah but pottery barn!
y’know what i think?
it is just she-she is weird.
y’know it is because she is a twin.
twins are weird.
huh.
y’know what is not one of a kind?
a twin!
hey!
oh, you like it?
you want to know where i got it?
hey pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new…(on rachel’s glare)…old sheet?
my apothecary table!!!
i got it at pottery barn!!
okay?!
of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled!
and thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
wow!
i did not know that there was a pottery barn up here.
a little?
your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue.
oh look at that!
the ornamental bird cage!
large!
(glaring at rachel) fascinating.
hmm, a lot of this stuff is from colonial times.
hey, what are some other time periods rachel?
(she glares at him.)
really?!
(to rachel) hey, y’know what?
since you have such a great sense of what i need, uh ooh, here is-here is 60 bucks, why do not you take phoebe down to that colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
she does want to.
hey!
y’know what would cheer you up?
I am giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, i think you should come.
ohh, god, nobody likes him, and he is so cheap, he would never fly to london in a million years.
yeah, invite him?
hey, did i do these neat enough?
(hands her some envelopes.)
yeah?
sure.
why not?
yeah?
wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we should not invite her?
yeah sure.
huh?
yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
i do not want to be single, okay?
i just... i just- i just want to be married again!
hi.
you know you probably did not know this, but back in high school, i had a, um, major crush on you.
you did!
oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother.
oh.
listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out?
sometime?
maybe?
okay... okay, maybe i will...  see, i see.... big passion in your future.
i do.
hey, i have a question.
well, actually, it is not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
okay.
umm, for a while now, I have been wanting to, um.... yes, yes, that is right... what?
[the cat jumps on his shoulders] ow!
you were incredible!
brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?
(ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.)
I am fine, I am fine.
you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
i was doing great with julie before i found out about you.
the point is i... i do not need this right now, ok. it, it is too late, I am with somebody else, I am happy.
this ship has sailed.
fine.
good.
no, hey, i get that, okay, i get that big time.
and I am happy for ya, but I am tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!
okay, i do not know what to do anymore.
is this about mark?
okay, it is not, it is not.
oh I am, I am making this too hard.
okay, what do you want me to do.
okay, okay, fine, you are right.
let us ah, let us take a break, (goes to the door) let us cool off, okay, let us get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door) yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend i told you about last night?
(he is frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.
oh, i found it!!
yeah!
oh, thank you.
(she goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.)
hey, hey.
(opens the door, sees rachel, and hides chloe behind the door) rachel!!!!
yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
yes, you can, very much.
(seeing the thumbs up) ahhhh!!
(hugs rachel tighter.)
no!!
no!!
no!!
i want to stay.
i want to talk about this.
what?
she was... she, she was different.
nobody likes change.
what?
okay, okay, okay, okay.
we were on a break!!!!!!!
yeah, i really do.
yeah, but what am i going to do, i mean we-we both agreed that it was going to be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
you think?
hey, you are right.
but we have not seen each other since then.
well i land in china, guess who is in charge of the dig.
oh, that is so sweet.
(listens) no, no, ok, you hang up.
ok, ok, one, two, three.
(he does not hang up and motions for rachel to be quiet.)
well you did not hang up either.
ok, no, no, you hang up.
you, you, y—(rachel grabs the phone and hangs it up for him.)
rach, i got a message from you.
you are over me?
wha... you are uh, you are, you are over me?
when, when were you... under me?
ok, i need to lie down.
really.
it is always been you, rach.
I have no idea, could be.
listen, I am sorry i had to work tonight.
what.
oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
gunther!
gunther.
gunther, please tell me you did not say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place.
y'know, hey!
you are the one who ended it, remember?
you still love me?
what does this mean?
what do you, i mean do you want to, get back together?
what?!
(starts to cry) fine by me!!
(he opens the door and traps chandler behind it) you know what, you guys, we do not have to watch this.
y'know what?
i think we have seen enough, let us turn it off.
ok, fine, well I am not going to watch, alright.
(walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on the endtable) okay dad.
yeah, well.
I am sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
yeah, I will take some.
what?
hey, y'know while we are on that, when are you going to tell my sister that you do not live here anymore.
phoebe, she does not know that you sneak out every night, she does not know that you sneak back every morning, and she does not know that you have been living with your grandmother’s for a week now.
hey.
so how many more do you have tomorrow?
(to phoebe) sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
i have to go.
yeah, carol should be home by now, soo... oh, better, actually.
y'know i-i-i think i finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
yeah, y'know how i have you guys, well she does not really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, susan something, and they really hit it off, and i-i-i think it is going to make a difference no real-, honey, really it is fine, just g-go with susan.
really, i, no, i think girls night out is a great idea.
okay, okay, bye i do not know, something girlie.
(all depressed) hi.
where is everybody?
my marriage, i think my marriage is um, is kind of over.
‘because carol’s a lesbian.
(phoebe is shocked) and, and I am not one.
and apparently it is not a mix and match situation.
(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) I am an idiot.
i mean shoulda seen it, i mean carol and I would be out and she would, she would see some beautiful woman, and, and she would be ross y'know look at her, and I would think, god, my wife is cool!
well, now i do!!
seven years.
i mean we have been together seven years, she is the only woman who is ever loved me, and the only woman I have-I have ever.... maybe this would have happened if I would been more nurturing, or I would paid more attention, or i... had a uterus.
i can not believe this!
thanks.
thanks.
(kisses her on the lips) wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
wait, wait, wait.
my foot is stuck in the pocket.
no, i can not get it out.
no, come on do not start.
(they start kissing again) ouch!
stupid balls are in the way.
(holds up two balls) oh well.
it probably would have been the most constructive solution.
huh?
(the rest of the gang enters) my wife’s a lesbian.
hi.
(to chandler) dude, that reverse lay-up!
oh… amazing!
oh, you guys call him cute coffeehouse guy, we call him hums while he pees.
it is not a club.
hey, divorced men are not bad men!
soon he will be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
maybe i should open a divorced men’s club.
i could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
i like this one.
(points to it.)
it seems to say, "i love you and that is why i have to kill you."
yeah?
what?!
no!
look, i do not think so pheebs.
(pause) all right, I will do it.
but just because you are a friend.
(grabs the tickets and heads to divert whitney.)
all right!
i want my key back!
it is right there!
(points to her hand.)
look, I am sorry but you-you-you better go pheebs.
oh yeah—no—you are welcome.
we will talk about it later.
hi whitney.
yep.
(phoebe slams the door shut.)
okay.
(opens the door and to whitney) hi!
I am sorry, but can you give me a second while i talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
okay.
(closes the door.)
(to phoebe) i did divert her and we ended up having a great time!
okay?
yes!
that is where we realized we were both super cool people!
like what?
okay.
fine!
thank you for warning me.
at breakfast I will be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
yeah!
pheebs come on!
i mean, consider the source!
of course her ex-husband’s going to say that stuff.
now, if you will excuse me… hi.
listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and f.y.i she must have shown kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room!
and his response to each one was, "i do not give a tiny rat’s ass."
well, i do not think we are going to have that problem, but maybe that is just because i am not emotionally unavailable!
i think he can be.
well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
(angrily) i knew you were going to throw that in my face!!
that was three years ago!
she apologized and she apologized!
what more do you want?!!
so do we!!
so do we!!
(ross notices a couple has been staring at them.)
I am sorry you had to see that.
my god!
well maybe she would not have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
wh-what is up?
oh just say it kyle!
(to whitney) y’know, he hums when he pees!
it makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
that is all right, we-we do not need you.
in fact, hey I am over it already.
(to phoebe) I am sorry.
ugh, pheebs, you were, you were right about her.
y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon!
yeah, i hurt my back a little.
yeah, were better off without them.
divorced men’s club.
oh, we went to see a collection of victorian doorknobs and the cupert-hewitt museum.
yeah.
bye.
(they kiss.)
oh yeah, she is-she is amazing.
and-and she is so much fun.
and!
y’know what?
when I am with her, I am fun!
i even signed up for helicopter classes.
(chandler is shocked.)
she is leaving in two days, i do not have to do it.
yeah, she is got to go back to london.
but you know what?
I have been prepared for this from the start.
we both knew we had two weeks together, and that is it.
y’know.
pheebs!
(starts rubbing her belly) hello!
hello!
well, as much as I would like to meet josh and warn him, emily and i are not going to be here.
all right?
i mean, she is going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I have got a whole special evening planned.
so I am sorry, no party.
you really did not know?
(interrupting monica and emily) so we should probably get going soon.
yeah, but we-we have to be at the four seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then the plaza for dinner.
no-no-no, no, umm, actually american surprise parties are-are-are very short.
it is usually, "surprise!"
and then, "oh my god, I am so surprised—good-bye!"
monica said that did she?
(he squeezes monica’s knee really hardly and monica winces in pain.)
yes, we have something we have to get to.
what big thing?
(stopping them) okay, that-that is enough!
y’know, let us, let us let someone else play.
okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
that is okay.
she is still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it is too late to do any of the things i had planned, so… yeah.
helps a little.
yeah, have a seat.
that is okay, i mean it was just two-week thing anyway, i just did not want it to end this way, y’know?
what do you mean?
yeah, i really do.
yeah, but what am i going to do, i mean we-we both agreed that it was going to be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
you think?
hey, you are right.
thanks.
(he starts to go inside and stops.)
what photo album was it?
oh my god!
those were not albino kids, that was computer camp!
rach!
(he hurries inside and chandler is taking out the garbage.)
god that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
yeah, you did not get one.
hey!
(entering) hey!
oh no, i have plans with elizabeth.
I am sorry, it is just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!
i do not know.
wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
uh-uh—wow!
uh, i thought you guys were just like making jokes, i had no idea.
what you know what?
you guys are wrong.
uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but i never notice it.
you know why?
because she is very mature.
besides, it does not really matter to me what you guys think.
i mean, I am the one dating elizabeth, not you!
yeah, yeah you have the ring?
(to the rest of them) yeah-yeah you guys.
get out of here!
what is-what is going on?
oh, you have to call the police!
that is what i did to the kids in my building!
oh!
(does a laugh/groan.)
listen umm, i, i just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight.
umm, it is supposed to be excellent.
the director is the same… no!
okay!
okay!
(stops her.)
okay, look, can i, can i just-just talk to you for a second?
uh, so this play umm, what do you think?
it is-it is gotten great reviews!
y’know the uh… (screaming) everybody put their balloons down!!!
(there is a temporary cease fire.)
now this is a nice suit!!
(shows everyone where he was hit.)
oh my god, you guys!!
(he is excited about what he thought happened.)
who?
what?
(excited) a-ohh!
(realizes) ohh.
oh that is right that is right.
that is richard’s favorite place too.
yeah, i was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
y’know, maybe she is too young for me.
y’know, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby-sitter.
i finally started to see what you guys were talking about.
i do not know what to do.
okay umm, bad stuff.
well, I am-I am 12 years older than she is.
hmm.
okay, good stuff.
umm, well she is-she is sweet and pretty and… no!
no!
i…did not do that.
it is just… okay, honestly no.
i do not, i do not see a big future with her.
I have got to talk to her.
ugh, i hate this part.
(in his head) wow!
i have never had such a healthy break-up!
she was such a grown-up about it!
she did not seem too immature for me!
did i just make a huge mistake?
elizabeth, thank god!
i was just thinking about… what?!
okay, break-up’s still on!
what happened you guys?
rach!
hey, come on in.
oh, thanks.
yeah, i really thought we would be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just was not meant to be.
i guess so.
right.
ohh!
you-you want me to be your backup.
ohh, yeah i already have one.
phoebe.
ohh, i do not think so.
that is impossible!
i mean we have had a deal for years!
we-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
(entering) hey!
phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
i was not!
no!
pick me!
i do not want to end up an old maid!
ooh, i want to switch to rachel too!
all right.
no, they are not.
you are wrong.
you are wrong.
(getting up, upset) I am calling mom.
(to monica) well, you were right.
how can they do this to us, huh?
it is thanksgiving.
will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
well, I am off to carol's.
(mimicking) ooh, ooh.
because she is my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
hi, is uh, is carol here?
oh, i uh, just came by to pick up my skull.
well, not mine, but...susan: come in.
thanks.
yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum.
kind of like a big face without skin.
ok. (browsing the apartment) wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
(picking up a book) hey, hey, yertle the turtle.
a classic.
the uh, the baby that has not been born yet?
would not that mean you are... crazy?
you are not serious, i mean, you really... you really talk to it?
do you uh, do you talk about me?
really?
look, if she is talking to it, i just think that i should get some belly time too.
not that i believe any of this.
oh, i hate this story.
i do not know.
it is just not the same without mom in the kitchen.
that is closer.
ok, I am off to talk to my unborn child.
ok, mom never hit.
ok, ok, here we go.
(he crouches down near her stomach) ok, where am i talking to, here?
i mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.
you know, i, you know, can not do this.
uh, this is too weird.
i feel stupid.
(quickly talking) hello, baby.
hello, hello.
and everyone is telling me, you got to pick a major, you got to pick a major.
so, on a dare, i picked paleontology.
and you have no idea what I am saying, because, let us face it, you are a fetus.
you are just happy you do not have gills anymore.
oh, please.
i am not singing to your stomach, ok?
shh!
(singing) here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet.
hey, hey!
(to carol) hey, uh, did you just feel that?
does it always, uh--?
(singing) hey, hey, you are my baby, and i can not wait to meet you.
when you come out I will buy you a bagel, and then we will go to the zoo.
(singin) hey, hey, I am your daddy.
I am the one without any breasts.
here we come, walkin' down the—this does not smell like mom's.
i do not even want to know about the dark cheese.
and hey, here is to a lousy christmas.
yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, i do not think it gets bett... (ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep) what?
how come that you do not have to go!
hey!
hey, you guys will not believe what i have to do for work today.
(covering with his hand chandler's face, like pretending he is not there) (to monica) there are these two professors who are joining my department and i have to meet them here and show them around campus.
it is i just know they are going to be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
(looking his elbow, where there is a patch) these are not suede.
hi, hi, I am ross geller.
oh, oh, that is, that is, that is nice.
oh, no, it is no big deal, i mean, if i were not doing this I would just, you know, be at the gym working out.
oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute.
(hitting monica with his suitcase) (to charlie) we should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
i do not think so.
oh, well he is obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can not come on time, then do not come at all".
(pause) an option that many of my students use.
(pause) shall we?
you know what, he is a big boy, I am sure he will find us, ok?
oh, damn it!
(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to charlie) so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
(to charlie) oh, it is not over!
so basically all nuts?
I have lost the will to live.
what?
oh... ok, fine.
but... ehm... i just have one question for you, ehm... (aping professor spafford) when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll... (entering with charlie) oh, hey you guys!
this is charlie!
charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica.
yeah, charlie is going to be joining my department.
(to phoebe) ranion's theory of species variegation?
oh my god, she is great!
i mean, we-we have so much in common and she is just cool, and funny... really?
wh-what is wrong?
I am sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she is a collegue.
(looking at them) wh-what is going on?
no, i arranged that... (to charlie) so, eh... it is probably going to be hard for you to leave boston, huh?
ooh... so sad... still, it can not be easy for you to leave harvard?
especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?
you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
... and you called him alby!?
(laughs) i mean that is like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby... eh, you think?
i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
(very interested) oh!
like what?!
(charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) oh I am sorry, i do not mean to pry... it is just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "access hollywood".
who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
(a little suprised) two?
wha...?
do not tell me you dated benjamin hobart oh my god!
have you ever been in a relationship with someone who has not won the nobel prize?
oh yeah?
no, no nobel prizes for him?
huh... huh... what a loser!
some more wine?
(takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter) (sarcastically) oh great!
after i finish my wine I am going to blow my... eh.
average-sized brains out.
she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners.
oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!
(rachel nods) man, i can not compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league!
oh my god!
oh much, much worse.
i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?)
"can we walk"?
(phoebe starts laughing) oh, you... you like that?
what?
(turns around to look at rachel) nice to meet you.
oh, I am no actor, I am a professor of palaeontology.
oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
I would lead with that.
just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
it is actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
yeah, maybe.
i do have my whole career in front of me.
i mean, i can still win a nobel prize.
although the last two papers I have written were widely discredited.
and sexy.
yeah, you are right, thanks pheebs, I am going to go find her.
stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
(to rachel) hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?
I am smarter than him!
hey!
so what is the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
oh my god!
monday?!
you can not go, i mean you are the glue that holds this group together!
not you.
i went thru this with ben and carol.
one cup of coffee will not affect your milk.
rach, you do not have to call whenever you have a little question, okay?
trust me, i know this.
rachel, i can see you dialing!
i do not understand why... (enters from his bedroom)who the hell was that?!
rach, you can not call people at three in the morning.
was there anything you did wrong with emma?
well, what was it?
rach, i told you, you can not call him every time any little thing comes up.
dr. gettleman?
yeah i know, i do not think that is a good idea.
in fact, i think he is dead.
rach, i promise first thing tomorrow we will find another doctor, but i got to get up early and I am not feeling all that well.
you know?
come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like!
(walks back into his room.)
(comes back into the living room) rachel!!!
thanks doctor.
you even have to ask?!
(he grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (sees rachel) (to rachel) he is alive!
hey!
you promised you would not say anything.
he is a brilliant diagnostician!
why?
why?
i know it is a little weird, but hey, he is a great doctor, okay?
he knows my medical history, and every time i go in there, he makes a big deal.
'ah look, it is my favorite patient!'
hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
it did not spend much time on the wall!!!
excuse me, i do not mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
with the circus?
he is behind the elephant.
yeah, that is how i know.
I am ross by the way.
i am a single parent.
well, let us say, i do not know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
hmm, yeah.
(to a random boy in the waiting room) come on ross jr. it is time to go in.
hey, i helped you find waldo!
(enters) oh good, you have not left yet.
i got held up at dr. gettleman's office.
there was some guy that freaked everybody out.
oh man.
food.
oh my god.
it is like sophie's choice.
i just can not see chandler cheating!
i know, and with the baby coming?
i do not know.
phoebe, if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
no one, I am just saying if... (phoebe starts pinching him in his neck) (yelling in pain) i know nothing!
mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
believe me, if i did see with someone, there is no way i... (phoebe starts pinching him again) we think chandler might be having an affair.
what is going on?
oh my god.
(sarcastic) so you want to buy a house in the 50's?
you know what, if you want to look for a house, that is okay.
(to joey) it is ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to mon and chan), but you are going to realize, this is the only place, you want to be.
what?
you put an offer on a house?
yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here.
i mean, how can you leave this place?
you can see where he would have trouble.
that money is mine, green!
what was monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
correct.
rachel claims this is her favorite movie… correct.
her actual favorite movie is... monica categorizes her towels.
how many categories are there?
two seconds... 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
(the guys celebrate.)
(to the girls) chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
no, 19. joey had an imaginary childhood friend.
his name was?
correct, his profession was?
correct!
what is chandler bing’s job?
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
do not blame the questions!
chandler!!!
chandler!!!
(he opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; chandler and monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.)
chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window!
chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister!
now get out here!
what the hell are doing?!!
(to chandler) i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister!
my best friend and my sister!
i-i cannot believe this!
(happily) my best friend and my sister!
i cannot believe this.
(he hugs them both.)
and hey, here is to a lousy christmas.
you know, sometimes when I am alone in my apartment, i look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching tv or something, but... it makes me feel better.
and now when i look over, who am i going to see?
the gottliebs, the yangs?
they do not make me feel so good.
(joey pats ross on his back) yeah.
I am sorry too.
I am even more sorry that that phone call did not come before i told you about looking through the window.
love you guys.
(he kisses monica, he, rachel and phoebe leave.)
i love this.
(he got a sweater) seriously you guys, what is going on?
what are these for?
i...reorganized the fridge.
see, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.
(there is nothing on the shelf.)
middle shelf: fruits and vegetables.
(there is one lone tomato.)
and top shelf: expired products.
(the shelf is jammed packed.)
because i am bored...out of my mind.
I have already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
hey, i am not unemployed.
I am on sabbatical!
so what, we just sit?
I am sorry, man.
hey, y'know what you should do?
you should make something happen for yourself.
y'know, like-like write a play.
write a movie!
huh?
i mean, what about those good will hunting guys?
or that.
I will help you.
yeah, I will make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
and plus, it will give me something to do.
yeah!
(grabbing a notepad and sitting down) all right, we will start off slow.
the only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
and it can not be joey.
or joseph.
all right.
(reading.)
a room.
a man enters, he looks suspicious.
(stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.)
that is it?
(joey shrugs.)
joey, you are supposed to have five pages done by now!
including an exciting incident!
(flipping through the rest of the pad.)
and what is, and what is all this?!
(reading.)
the official rulebook of fireball.
this is helping your career?!
huh?
i thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
(to chandler) and shame on you!
you should know better, joey needs to work.
(to joey) now come on!
no!
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
you can have this back when the five pages are done!
(after joey walks past, ross throws the ball down in pain.)
ahh!
(chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
so pheebs, are you going to go back out there or what?
oh-oh, yeah.
uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
yeah, not since i got too strong for you.
yeah.
oh fine.
joey's not going.
because tomorrow he is redoing yesterday's pages.
i think he is been relaxing enough, thanks to you and fireball.
i am not unemployed.
I am on sabbatical!
and the reason I am doing this is because i am joey's friend.
and if you were a good friend, you would be doing the same thing.
if it does?
then you are an amazing friend of mine.
how about we settle this right now!
(he rips up the tickets.)
there!
now, no one's going to the game.
ha-ha-ha!
no you did not.
you said you would, but you never did!
hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, going to need stitches ball.
yay!
i guess when you do not have so many distractions, it is easier for you to focus.
huh?
all right.
(takes another copy.)
hey man.
about yesterday, i was really wrong.
i am sorry.
maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest… (pauses and looks at joey.)
but we had our best friend's interest at heart.
i do not know, I am one sorry polentologist.
(stops reading.)
all right joey, we get it.
(to chandler) I am sorry.
(reading from the script.)
i am sorry, chandler.
hey wow, monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree!
did someone get her drunk again or?
… and that is the story of the dreidle.
now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death.
and that was like 4000 years ago.
i am so over janine.
i mean, yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now she is like old news!
hi janine!
you are going to be a party person!
those guys rock the most!
oh, well you see how it works is, the part with dick clark in times square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time.
yeah, not a lot of people know that.
are you serious?
bye janine!
it was a dry day.
oh my god!
got it!
oh my god it is just like i dreamed it!
yeah, i have a question.
when is this going to air?
right.
no biggie.
stay loose.
why do they keep doing that?
right.
hey, what did you guys do to get up on there?
yeah!
we know!
okay.
monica!
(pause) would it?
hey, i know what will get us up on a platform!
the routine!
hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he will want to build us our own platform!
we got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category!
look, it is almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
so, do we really have to ask who is going up on the platform next?
can you believe this?
we are going to be on the platform for the millennium moment!
no!
hey, when the music starts up again, i was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know?
(he mimics a robot) i do not know, i mean you were a lot bigger, i mean, stronger back then.
yeah, see.. you took mine.
chandler, what about you?
joey, uh- omnipotent.
i cannot sleep in a public place.
it is okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
why?
funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
so, I am guessing you had an extra ticket and could not decide which one of you got to bring a date?
oh my god, oh- is today the twentieth, october twentieth?
ohhh.
today's the day carol and i first.. consummated our physical relationship.
(joey is puzzled.)
sex.
..you know what, i-I would better pass on the game.
i think I am just going to go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
what are you doing?
alright, alright, maybe it will take my mind off it.
do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
you can totally, totally live on this.
oh, by the way, great service tonight.
carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know.
fact, she, uh- she never took'them off, because we-we- (off chandler's look) sorry.
sorry.
peach pit.
(points) peach pit.
that night we, uh- we had- actually, nectarines, but basically... then, uh, then we got dressed, and i-i... i walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop...
I am fine.
(squeezing past people) sorry, sorry... uh-oh.
no, actually i was just saying it looks like we are not sitting together.
but now you mention it, there was ice there that night... it was the first frost... get him!
get him!
get him!
get- yesss!
not laughing now, are ya pal!
pass it!
pass it!
(jumping to his feet) look, i do not want to make any trouble, okay, but I am in a lot of pain here, alright?
my face is dented.
hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) heyy... i remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
look, it is just a little more complicated... little louder, okay, i think there is a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that did not quite hear you... my first time with carol was... (he mumbles the last part) it was my first time.
hi.
(he is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.
he tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
fun?
where was the fun?
tell me specifically, which part was the fun part?
where is my puck?
the kid...?
(to the kid) excuse me, uh, that is, that is my puck.
(to the kid) oh yeah?
well, I am rubber, you are glue, whatever—(to chandler)—can not do it.
(to the kid) listen, uh- give me back my puck.
'yes', how about.
c'mere.
give me!
(tries to snatch it from the kid) give me my puck!!
(but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist) ...now that was fun.
(doing the spinning) okay, monica: right foot red.
okay, pheebs: right hand blue.
(phoebe has to bend over.)good.
(joey stares at her butt appreciatively) green.
to the green.
hey, what is going on?
i found a note on my door, "come to monica’s quick, bring champagne and a three musketeers bar."
what is up?
oh my god.
(hugs chandler.)
congratulations.
where is she?
oh, i thought it was just a kid yelling, "I am gay!
I am gay!"
can i bring her in?
hey!
wow!
happy monica’s night!
thanks.
well sure.
but i get married all the time so… you okay?
you mean, we—you and me?
oh good, you scared me for a minute.
i mean—no, it is just ‘because, it is just because you and i were like a nightmare.
(screams.)
no, but there was some good times.
surely you can think of something good.
what?
yeah?
i was good at the stuff huh?
my hands?
yeah?
(to his hands) way to go guys.
y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
a what?
one night, just-just sex.
no strings attached?
no.
okay, this is getting a little crazy.
i mean, I am-I am sure it would be amazing but i…got to say i really-really do not think it would be a good idea.
y’know?
i really, really…do not.
okay, monica.
mon, uh what-what you just saw… it is!
it is!
okay!
ho-ho!
we did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
yeah!
it was just a kiss.
(phoebe enters and overhears this.)
look let us not make a big deal out of this!
it was a one time thing.
it does not even matter!
oh no!
and; people thinking it is huge has led monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.
(to monica) which we are not!
guess who?
(enters fully.)
hey, i just realized we kind of let some stuff up in the air… still thinking about it huh?
(loosening his tie) oh, who cares?
(tightening his tie) and so do i. okay.
sure.
(sits down on her bed.)
(sitting up) no!
(exits.)
(to rachel) hey, here is a thought.
got me.
(he shows of his hands.)
uh, rachel, I have been thinking.
i do not think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.
I am calling it off.
look uh, if we are going to do this… oh, i see, so everybody wins.
oww!
(deadpan) well, I am going to take off.
(to chandler) congratulations man.
(at the door) and uh, rachel.
what can i say, you missed your chance.
from now on the only person who is going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me.
(quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)
what?
well, I will-I will be there.
i mean i have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so… (exhales sarcastically) not two years in a row.
yeah.
yeah, i think i will.
yeah.
that is right!
he was hitting on her, and i got her.
i guess the better man won.
(to joey) please do not take her from me.
(entering) hey!
(he is wearing a costume as well.)
remember the russian satellite, sputnik?
(they all look at him.)
well, I am a potato or a…spud.
and these are my antennae.
(points to the colander with an old tv antenna glued on top that he is wearing.)
so sputnik, becomes… (they are still confused) spud-nik.
spudnik!
no, i-I am not doody.
hey!
you made it!
well, I am a spud… yes!
that is funny.
yeah.

I will prove it like a theorem!!
oh yeah?

(pause) gettin’ a little tired though.

oh god, here we go!
anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out.

(he takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
hey, does anybody want to get some lunch?

(pokes his eye) all right, i got to go.
I am taking ben to the park.

(phoebe ignores him) pheebs?
(turns away) hello?
(he sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.)
phoebe?
(he moves closer and she keeps moving away.)
phoe-phoebe!
(they end up hanging over the arm rest.)
come on!
(he grabs the magazine away from her.)
phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something?
because if are please, tell me what it is i did!
well, i do not know.

okay, I am the baby.
(points at his eye.)
hey!
(entering) okay pheebs, i know how we are going to figure this out.
okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head.
okay?
what do you like better flora or fauna?
who would you rather be simon or garfunkle?
why are you mad at me?
when did i say you were boring?!
phoebe!
you and i have never played chess!
hey rach, can you pass me the tv guide?
you are welcome for a delicious dinner.
i know!
actually she is a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
I have seen her at work, but i always figured, ah-huh?
but, uh, i made her dinner.
we had a great time.
and we are going out again tomorrow.
fine by me; hope she wins.
how do you think it is going to look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange?
so, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
(moved by the kiss) huh... did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
mitzi is..... (mouths "where?")
uh... oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage and falters) ...do you have any, um, cinnamon fruit toasties?
well, i do!
why do not we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of cinnamon fruit toasties, uh... oh, yeah, why not?
you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
well, like that, only instead of a chair, it is a pile of garbage.
and instead of a jacket, it is a pile of garbage.
and instead of the end of the day, it is the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!
(ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to joey who puts it on.)
here.
what do you mean?
nothing happened!
i had to get out of there.
no, i tried that.
she says it has a weird smell.
i do not know.
soap?
yeah.
yeah.
yeah, okay you are right.
i mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
it is, uh... it is endearing, really.
(mustering up courage) yes.
yes i do.
(they go inside.)
department of sanitation?
oh!
(she kisses him) ah.
(they kiss more, and move down onto the couch.
ross's hand moves under some garbage) aw!
(his hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)
(trying to make his disgust into lust) ah, cheryl!
oh my god!
I am so sorry, cheryl.
i must have freaked out.
i do not know, you do not want to mess with corn nuts.
they are craaazy.
i can not believe it!
he is looking right at us!
okay, okay, what is going on?
yeah, well, does he look upset?
does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
what?
what?
what?!
that is nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
that is, that is nice twice!
what was with the dishes?
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
you-you had what?
what, uh... what were you thinking?
no!
no no, it is nothing like me and carol!
it is, it is, it is, uh, a totally diferent situation!
it is, it is apples and oranges, it is, it is orthodontists and lesbi- i got to go.
(leaving) i just have to go, all right?
do i need a reason?
huh?
i mean i have things to do with my life, i have a jam packed schedule, and i am late- for keeping up with it.
okay?
four letters: "circle or hoop".
thanks.
"heating device."
five letters.
i just want to clarify this: are you outing mr. peanut?
second date!
a no sex pact huh?
i actually have one of those going on with every woman in america.
cassie?
wow, i have not seen her for like forever.
i wonder if she still carries that barbie everywhere she goes.
so what!
i still have—no you are probably right.
what—why?
what?!
chandler she is our cousin!
fine, she can stay at my place.
by the way, what-what does cassie even look like now.
(shocked at her beauty) cassie?!
hey!
oh.
oh, that is right.
so-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you did not.
it is okay.
come, come on in.
oh.
uh-huh.
yeah i-i have a knack for impressions.
yeah—no!!
cassie, how you-how you doing on that…hot dog.
(quietly) thank god.
oh right.
right.
ooh, remember the time i uh, i pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?
(she laughs) we are probably too old to do that now.
(looking then moving away quickly) uh-huh!
uh-huh!
and-and-and I will always remember that summer because that is when i realized that we are related.
well I am, I am a little slow.
(to himself) just as our children would be.
(in his head) she is your cousin.
she is your cousin!
if she knew what was going on in your head she would think you were sick!
(she grabs some popcorn.)
or would she?
let us back up a second.
she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.
she was the one who turned down the lights.
she was the one that wanted to rent logan’s run, the sexiest movie ever.
(she grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.)
oh, i know that look.
forget it.
i want it.
she wants it.
I am going in.
(in his head) say something clever!
(pause.)
okay, does not have to be clever, it just has to be words.
say some words.
(pause) any words will do.
(pause) oh my god!
this is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!
(pause) there is nothing you can say to make this worse!!
so just say something!!
(pause.)
(to her) i-i, i uh have not had sex in a very long time.
(she leaves.)
(in his head) yeah, you really should not have said anything.
(to chandler) are you intrigued?
there is my boy!
here is my boy!
and here is his barbi (ben is holding a barbi doll) what is ah, what is my boy doing with a barbi?
yeah, it is, it is, it is cute.
why, why, why does he have it, again?
you know what it is fine.
if you are okay with the barbi thing, so am i. give daddy the barbi!
ben, give, give me the barbi.
okay, how 'bout, do not you want to play with the monster truck?
(makes a monster truck sound) no.
okay, oh, oh, how about a dino-soilder?
(squawks like a dinosaur) and that is bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
you did not want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
(to joey) where there is no fear of commitment.
guess who is here.
it is the toughest guy in toy land, ben.
(singing) 'a real american hero.
I am g.i.
joe!'
drop the barbi, drop the barbi.
look ben, it is a toy that protects you.s.
oil interests overseas!
(running into the hall, in slow motion) you will never get me, joe!!!
(he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against joey and chandler's door, dead.)
hey, i do not know what to tell you guys that is the doll he chose.
look, g. i. joe's in, barbi's out.
and if you guys can not deal with it, that is your 'too bad.'
what?
what are you talking about?
okay, you are totally making this up.
(remembering) oh god.
there was no song.
(to monica) there was no song!
okay.
okay, that is, that is enough.
(retreats to the bathroom) (coming out of the bathroom) will not you dance around with me.
hi!
(he kisses phoebe) oh, (he goes towards mike in order to shake hands but mike hugs him) hey, oh... i... i was-i was going for a hand shake.
that is why!
yeah, i thought we would be groomsmen, but would not they have asked us by now?
when did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
i want to say it is not looking good.
what?
(ross and chandler do not know what to say, so there is an embarrassing long pause) oh, man!
football!
i can not believe we are going to be the only people that are not in this wedding.
and it is a wedding!
it would be weird if I am not in it... who cares, and?
I will do it!
no, mike, no, no.
you want to pick me, i mean... watch!
(he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) huh?
(to chandler) well, if phoebe's choosing, then say hello to mike's next groomsman.
please, you are going down!
is that what they say on the figure skating team?
so, what did you decide?
I will do it!
(monica approaches) hey!
where is rach?
i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok?
I am not going to watch chandler up there while I am sitting in the seats like some chump!
(he goes to rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room).
(very fake gasp) oh!
my god!
you are breathtaking!
you have not by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
I am not!
I am making it easier!
pick me!
listen, listen.
whoever you pick is going to walk down the aisle with you!
now, i promise i will not say a word, but if you pick chandler he is going to be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
(waving his fist in the air in triumph) yes, yes!
(smiling to himself) good.
I am just getting some coffee.
so I am alert for the wedding.
(barely containing himself at this point) well, you have fun tonight.
oh, i will.
wait a minute, i know why I am being such an ass, why are you?
I am not supposed to tell you!
rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose.
you and me together again.
(he winks at her and rachel looks disgusted) what?
a dog?
no!
rachel gets to choose.
(to rachel) haha!
looks like you are not going to be in the wedding either.
(looks at phoebe) so sorry pheebs.
(to phoebe and mike) i can not believe you guys are not going to be able to get married today.
no, but chandler, hello... are not you scared of dogs?
(takes chappy from mike) well, i guess I am in the wedding then.
ha haaa... (smells chappy) he stinks!
uhm, ministers do not ride the subway for free.
I will... it is the dog.
uh joey... chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
come on chappy, do your business.
make!
ma-ake!
i did not sign on for this.
hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
now, how will they know if you are ready?
(he does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.)
you are good.
(tries a cookie.)
these are not.
five.
challenge extended.
challenge excepted.
we will be starting with apples.
yes.
yes.
yes.
(they are perfect so far.)
they have another guess.
how did you know she would buy scotch tape?
oh sure, "ross will do it!"
it is not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
no-no-no, i-i want to play.
the test is ready.
okay, each team will answer ten questions.
the first team that answers the most questions wins.
okay, the categories are, fears and pet peeves, ancient history, literature, and it is all relative.
now, the coin toss to see who goes first.
(he flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop.
then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.)
okay, somebody call it this time.
it is heads.
(the guys celebrate.)
gentlemen, pick your category.
what is monica’s biggest pet peeve?
that is correct.
ladies?
according to chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
that is correct.
gentlemen, you are pick.
monica and i have a grandmother who died, you both went to her funeral, name that grandmother!
althea is correct.
every week, the tv guide comes to chandler and joey’s apartment.
what name appears on the address label?
I am afraid the tv guide comes to chinandolor bong.
all right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys.
ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
you do not have to shout everything.
ooh.
what is the name of chandler’s father’s las vegas all-male burlesque?
all right, we have a tie.
luckily, i have prepared for such an event.

oh yeah.
oh yeah.
I am sorry.

yeah, but wait... hey.

for letting you throw me out of your office?
yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am i. yeah, well you never have the time.
i mean, i do not feel like i even have a girlfriend anymore, rachel.
no, but it would be nice if you realised, it is just a job!
yes.
no, hey, i get that, okay, i get that big time.
and I am happy for ya, but I am tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!
okay, i do not know what to do anymore.
is this about mark?
okay, it is not, it is not.
oh I am, I am making this too hard.
okay, what do you want me to do.
okay, okay, fine, you are right.
let us ah, let us take a break, (goes to the door) let us cool off, okay, let us get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door) oh, hi chloe.
yeah, little change in plans.
ahh, we are going to break-up instead.

one person wants to break-up, you break-up.
oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, do not i have to wait a while?
hi!
it is me.

I have been thinking, this is crazy, i mean do not, do not you think we can work on this?
who is that?
is that mark?
yeah!

(slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)
ah, that is okay, thanks.
look, i do not feel like dancing, i feel like having a drink.
okay?
(to chloe) i like this song.
oh, no, no.
(entering) hey.
is rachel here?
i got to talk to her.
damn!
i told emily to come.
and i just need to y'know, talk to rachel about it.
well look, I am just trying to focus on the "i get to see my wife," part, all right?
and not the part that makes me do this.
(he takes a big swig of pepto bismol.)
i have no idea.
i mean… but-but i assure you i will figure it out.
so, rach, y'know-y'know how emily's coming right?
anyway it-it kind of-it all boils down to this, the last time i talked to emily… what?!
le poo's still alive?!
hey, so uh, y'know how there is something i wanted to talk to you about?
well, y'know how I am trying to work things out with emily.
well, there is this one thing… okay, (rachel has her back turned to the camera, and ross is not looking at her.)
here goes.
i made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and ross notices something coming out of rachel's nose)-oh hey!
you are nose is bleeding!
umm… (rachel blows her nose.)
okay, i uh, i can not see you anymore.
hey.
rachel, i-i-I have been wanting to tell you something for a while now and i really, i just have to get it out.
okay, y'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
and while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants… …is for me not to see you anymore.
it is awful i know, i mean, i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work.
and i do, i have to make this marriage work.
i have too.
but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been.
this is so hard.
what are you doing?
rachel, this is your apartment.
you should have seen the look on her face.
i do not want rachel to hate me!
i do not know what to do.
yes!
please!
that is okay.
that is not advice!
I am going to the bathroom.
(gets up and exits.)
(entering) pheebs, you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec?
hi.
i talked to monica, look, I am the one who made the choice.
I am the one who is making things change, so i should be the one to y'know, step back.
no, no, it is okay.
really.
they are plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king.
so is, is that better?
well, what-what would you do?
rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
i can not believe this is happening.
i am so sorry.
hey!
whoa-whoa-whoa, knicks season opener tonight.
i thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
i did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
oh, but-but i can not do it.
because, because I have got ben.
of course he is!
what, do you think I would just use my son as-as an excuse?
what kind of father do you think i am?
(to the guys) i got to go make a fake ben.
oh, I am just over here with ben.
i thought we would say hi.
ben, say hi to aunt monica.
(he holds the phone to the fake ben he has created out of a pumpkin.)
oh, i guess he does not feel like talking right now.
he is smiling though!
okay, talk to you later.
(answering the phone) hello?
(listens) hey mon, how is the packing going?
(listens) ben?
he is fine.
yeah, he is right—oh my god!
(he looks over at the fake ben and notices that the head has fallen off.)
get your head of your shirt there son!
(he tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.)
what?
(listens) yeah, it is a pumpkin.
I will come pack.
and now you want that money back.
chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
(as he picks up the fake ben.)
I am sorry you lost your money, but i won it fair and square.
now, if you want to try to make some of it back, I would be glad to play you for it.
but i should warn you, i am very good at cups.
no.
... finally... god, you are amazing... i did not even have to ask you to call me that.
weh...*sigh* yeah, it is just... i do not think i can do this... no, no!
(they are moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) look, i need to talk to joey.
i mean, you guys just broke up.
before anything more happens between us, i need to know he is okay with it.
alright, I am going to go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) i just need a... need a before i can... you know.
(gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) okay, i see you later.
hey, what are you guys doing?
okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere?
well, if you see him could you please tell him I am looking for him?
thanks!
(walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) thank you!
(closes the door) (knocks on door) rach, you there?
(joey and rachel both get up from the bed) (knocks) rach?
is everything okay?
hey.
you know where joey is?
can i talk to you for a minute?
and then she told me that she and joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her.
anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing.
i mean, how angry do you think joey is going to be?
you know, i got to go find him.
he is got to be here someplace.
hey!
you guys ready to go?
dude!
you are not taking your bible?
learn about jesus... hey!
uh, no... no.
i could not find him.
I am just going to talk to him on the plane.
stop it!
you are filthy!
uh, actually i think she went to the salon.
ye... yeah... yeah... you got shellfish in your head.
you have never said that in your life, have you?
i thought so.
oh, i uh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference with charlie.
no, I will do it.
(he quickly grabs joey's boarding pass and gives joey his one.)
right, I am going to go talk to joey.
i think this is the right time.
he is always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
hey rach... do you mind if i sit here for a sec.?
hey!
so, i uhm... kind of need to talk to you about charlie.
okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... well, charlie and i were talking, and..., well... wha... (gasps) what?
what would give you that idea?
yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
what?
are you serious?
i am speachless... i mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that.
i mean, you are an incredible friend, you know that?
no, i mean it.
you are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous... you know what?
i know chandler longer, so i always think of him as my best friend, but now... i may have to rethink some stuff... hey, if there is ever, anything i can do for you... thanks!
hi!
ah, yeah.
we had a really good talk.
yeah!
oh, no, it is great.
it is great.
he is... he is an amazing guy.
well, I am so excited about this.
are you kidding?
i have had some very dirty dreams about this... (gasps) hi... there she is.
hi emma.
oh my god, i missed you.
(kisses her) oh emma, i missed you so much.
hey... did you have a good time with grandma green?
huh?
did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
(to rachel) ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?
okay?
i want you to wait right here.
come here sweetie.
(unpacking his bag) okay, shoot!
(gasps) oh no!
oh, major shampoo explosion!
oh, it is all over everything.
why?
why me?
(looks up) I am sorry, I am sorry.
you were saying?
oh, not another one!
oh my g... and this is moisturiser.
it is even harder to clean!
why?
why do bad things happen to good people?
duh, you think?
(enters the kitchen) marcel.
bring me the rice, c'mon.
bring me the rice, c'mon.
good boy.
good boy.
c'mere, give me the rice.
(marcel brings the rice) thank you, good boy.
well, i see he is finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'.
(rachel ignores him) 'bring me the' and- rach?
hi.
really.
whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'forget relationships!
I am done with men!'
the whole, uh, penis embargo?
wait-wait.
i, i got it.
i was there.
yes.
yes.
yes!
yes, i really do!
in fact, it is funny, very often, someone who you would not think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who... ...gets interrupted.
hi!
alright, I have got to go.
c'mon, marcel!
c'mon!
we are going to go take a bath.
yes we are, are not we?
yes, we are.
that is right, you are going to spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's, are not you.
'pwease, aunt monica, pwease?'
oh, unclench.
you are not even going to be there.
I am telling you, she said she is looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
well, i added the 'exactly like me' part... but she said she is looking for someone, and someone is going to be there tonight.
well, i think it is perfect.
y'know, it is just going to be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey... anyway, i figured after work I would go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
hey.
how did, uh, how did it go today?
yeah.
you, uh, you want some?
uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the north-east, i was, uh, kind of wanting to run something by you.
y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?
(uncorks the wine) well- okay, quick and painful.
(starts to cork the wine) oh, what?
what-what?
...yeah?
(angry) i- i- i ca- i can not believe this.
i mean, all i asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
no, y'know what, i guess it is partially my fault.
y'know, i should not have, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey.
i should have started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
you called animal control?
marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
I am not allowed to have him in the city.
if they find him, they will take him away from me.
that is right, i.. because i did not expect you were going to invite them to the apartment!
yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we did not.
cat!
my uncle marcel.
marcel?
marc- oh, this is ridiculous!
we have been all over the neighbourhood.
he is gone, he is-he is just gone.
oh come on.
it is cold, it is dark, he does not know the village.
(kicks a sign in frustration) and now i have a broken foot.
i have no monkey, and a broken foot!
thank you very much.
yeah, yeah.
y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey!
i do not miss marcel any more!
oh, no no no.
nono, this is just vintage rachel.
i mean, things just sort of happen around you.
i mean, you are off in rachel-land, doing your rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings... i do not even want to hear it, you are just... oh, forget it, okay?
what?
what?
hi, did you order some bananas?
give me back my monkey.
marcel?
marcel?
okay, where is he?
where is he?
marcel?
marcel?
marcel!
what have you done to him?
are you insane?
c'mere, marcel, c'mon.
(marcel starts to go to him) c'mere, marcel.
(turns to ross) okay, give me my monkey back.
alright, i want my monkey.
(to rachel) you had to be a bitch in high school, you could not have been fat.
it will be nice to get this off finally, will not it?
yes it will.
(marcel resists) or we can leave it on for now, that is fine.
listen, I am- I am sorry i was so hard on you before, it is just i... yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know?
you, you were great.
...hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine.
you in the mood for, uh, something grape?
alright.
(he goes to get the glasses.
then he hesitates and turns off the main light.
rachel looks round and he acts surprised) the, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.
(he sits down and starts to pour the wine) well, so long as we are here and, uh, not on the subject, i was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, i was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um... we have got to start locking that door!
all right!
(checking his watch) yes!!
from home to the hospital in under seven minutes!
we did it!!
no, but come on, we are off to a great start are not we?
i knew I would get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
wait a minute!
how-how the hell did you beat us here?
n… no!
we took a cab too, but i did test runs!
okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
okay.
okay.
(to the nurse behind the desk.)
umm hi, this is rachel green.
I am ross geller.
we-we called from the car.
yeah?
i really think they are out of rooms.
well then we would be in a lot of trouble, you do not know where any countries are.
(rachel glares at him.)
okay.
(he goes over to the desk followed by rachel.)
uh, say would you umm… would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have (handing her some money) opened up?
what-what?
thank you.
yeah, guess so.
whew!
check these out!
(he is looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and rachel groans.
ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.)
never done this before.
hi!
hi, I am uh ross.
I am here to ruin this magical day for you.
hi julie.
this is rachel.
(points at her.)
yeah.
umm say, i-i opened this earlier (the privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
oh, okay.
what?
oh.
okay, just breathe.
(simultaneously as rachel) we are not going to do that.
uh yes!
thank you.
later.
oh uh, I am sorry.
(runs out.)
hi!
I am so glad you are here, but it is going to be a while.
i-i wished you would called first.
oh good.
okay, what is up?
ma, you are asking me to marry you?
mom no, come on!
thank you.
n-no!
okay?
we have been through this!
we are not going to get married just because she is pregnant, okay?
mom, y’know what?
i-i can not deal with this right now.
I am sorry… gimmie!
(takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as rachel enters the hallway.)
…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I am not with rachel.
are you kidding?
look, we are not going to be together just because we are having a baby.
okay?
okay, stop it!
i can not deal with this right now.
i have to go have a baby.
(to rachel) hey.
who is that?
what happened to the disgustingtons?
wow!
sorry.
so uh, how are the new people?
yeah?
okay.
umm.
umm, I am-I am just going to—(closes the privacy screen.)
no-no, I am…I am sure no one was looking.
just want some privacy.
(he closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at rachel.)
just ignore them.
what?
what?
(to him) hey!
you want to live to see your baby?!
the nurse said they are bringing in another woman.
that is it.
that is it.
just three?!
I am dilated three!
actually it is more like this.
(pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)
uh rach… and yet somehow it is true!
(to rachel) squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
(softly) really?
oh there you go!
no-no.
we… um uh…we are-we are just having this baby together but uh, uh that is all.
uh well umm…we are just not in that place, y’know?
but we are very excited about this.
sid you lucky deaf bastard.
hey!
not just janice, janice in labor, contracting and everything.
y’know what i think it is?
i think you have made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just does not want to leave.
sweetie you are doing great.
what?
you do?
you do?
(looks) oh my god!
what is that?
oh thank god, i thought she had two heads.
go!
yes you can!
hey!
hey!
come on!
you can!
i know you can do this!
let us go!
no!
come on let us—one more time!
one final push!
ready?
1…2…3!
(rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting ross and knocking him down.)
(from the floor) keep pushing!
you have no idea how much this hurts.
(all of the women in the room turn and glare at him.)
keep going!
keep going!
oh!
oh!
she is upside down but she is coming!
she is coming!
oh!
oh my god oh!
oh my god she is here.
oh she is…she is perfect.
oh it is okay.
they are just-they are just wrapping her up.
oh, come in.
the doctor says it is completely normal with all the hormones.
plus, you-you are sleep deprived.
uh actually, we-we have narrowed it down to two names.
wow!
umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is isabella.
(rachel starts crying.)
what?
umm, delilah.
so i guess we are back to uh, baby girl.
ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
(entering) hey janice!
who is this little guy?
(gasps when he sees aaron.)
no-no.
no.
okay.
man!
did you see the kid on that nose?
huh?
yeah.
yeah, it really was.
but we…we got to be careful.
we…we can not let that happen again, y’know?
i mean we do not want to go down that road do we?
oh my god!
I am sorry, i was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
yeah.
she is putting her down now, that is her.
(points to the nurse putting emma now.)
look at emma!
oh what are you kidding?
she is gorgeous, it is all rachel.
it is…it is complicated okay?
look, we have been together.
okay?
and then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.
(pause) it is just if-if we got together again and it did not work out…i could never do that to emma.
i mean she-she thinking everything—(starts to cry.)
oh that is…now me.
what do they put something in the water in this place?
since rachel and i we are doing really, we are doing really well right now.
yeah, exactly.
pheebs, what is wrong?
so, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or (in a tender way) did he cry?
(the guys look at him) yeah, big surprise, i like proposals!
(to charlie) hey!
guess who is a finalist for a huge research grant!
I will give you a hint, he is looking right at you.
oh, I am so excited, i mean, apparently i beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys i went to graduate school with.
not that I am keeping score or anything... five!
well, ok, it is for 25 thousand dollars.
and if i get it, I will finally be able to complete my field research!
and there will be an article about me in the "paleontology review"!
yeah!
that will be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
yeah.
why?
your ex-boyfriend?
so, your ex-boyfriend is going to determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant?
wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
well, if you think it would help.
ok, now, is there anything i can do to... you know, butter him up?
anything he really likes?
we will see how dinner goes.
i can not believe I am about to meet benjamin hobart.
I have always thought of him as one of the people I would invite to my fantasy dinner party.
do you think there is any chance he will bring christie brinkley or c3po?
well, i... i am having a good hair day.
I am ok. it is an honor to meet you.
i can not tell you how long I have been an admirer of your work, i mean, that nobel prize, (he thumbs up) whoooo!
i mean, i have to tell you that, you are one of the reasons i got into the field.
no, but, it is, you know, it is just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, mmm.
ok well, i would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
see, there are still several areas that have not been fully excavated.
what?
did you just say "break up with charlie"?
kind of inappropriate, do not you think?
are you serious?
no!
(rolls his eyes) i guess!
(shocked and confused by the question) what?
i... i... (benjamin looks at him as if to say "what is wrong?
answer the question") (annoyed) may 12th?
(even more shocked) wha..?
i need 6 graduate students.
wha...?
wait, wait, wait, just a minute.
none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology.
(annoyed) um...
I have never heard of a "boscodictiasaur".
(stares at him angrily) ok. (determined to spell it correctly) b - of - s ... oh come on!!
oh hi!
hello!
uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions?
uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?
(now yelling) aunt margaret's pants size?
(sarcastic) no!
stop!
(skeptical) really?
i have to break up with charlie?
you are crazy.
crazy!
(yelling) get out!
(benjamin leaves) your ex-boyfriend is insane.
no i did not, and you want to know why?
because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
yeah.
he would not give me the grant, because i would not give you up.
really?
is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "underdog"?
if you do not believe me, let us go talk to him, okay?
I am telling you, he did not ask me one paleontological question.
oh, I am sorry, no.

nice to see you again dr. green.
ugh, museum.
there never was a library.
i mean there are libraries, its just that i ah, i never worked at one.
yeah, if you are really hungry.
(dr. green stares at him) it was a joke, i made a joke.
it is not a library... so, dr. green, how is the old boat.
it gives it a nice antiquey look.
wow.
I am sorry, when i was a kid i lost a bike to that.
(rachel giggles at that) okay!
(picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
yeah.
(sees the bill) op!

but does not it bother you?
you are a waitress.

thanks again, dr. green.
oh, ah, you do not need that.

i know.
nothing i do means anything, really.
well mr. big shot is better than ‘wethead’.
four percent.

i tip more than that when there is a bug in my food.
yeah, I am going to go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
hey pheebs, what are you doing?
look, honey, i have tried to make nice, it does not work.
look sweetie, i could be the bigger man, i could be the biggest man, i could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still would not make any difference, except that i could pick your father up and say ‘like me!
like me tiny doctor!’ rachel one brunch is not going to solve anything.
you got to face it, okay we are never going to get along.
okay, okay, okay.
(hugs her) I will get the bagels.
dr. green.

thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
(to rachel) okay, that is it, i can not take it anymore.

(to rachel) wow!
this is going so well.

I am honored!
and y’know what I am going to do as my first act as your best friend?
I am going to get you to talk to chandler.
he is coming here for thanksgiving!

hey, y'know, mon, if things wrong out between you and richard’s son, you would be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
(to rachel) oh hey!
hey uh, you remember the necklace i gave you last year?
can i see it?
i just want to check something.
(he puts his hand over the hole on the box.)
(to chandler) now, we will see.
(grabbing the necklace) the necklace i got you was gold, this one is silver.

oh, and joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
there is nothing the matter with me.

i do not know what to say, I am sorry.
though, you are not supposed to take these.
(points to the bone) it is like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
