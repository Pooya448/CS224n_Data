I am sorry . okay , bye . all right shut up for a second and let me just see something . ( she kisses him back on the lips ) oh , wow ! ( they then hug and kiss , very passionately . ) hey ! so what do you think ? yes ! now , they are a little more than i normally spend on boots…or rent ( shows him the receipt . ) i know . I am sorry , they just , they just look so good ! and the saleswoman was looking at me like , `` oh , these are way too expensive for you . '' hey . they are mine ! honey , I am not returning them . okay ? i mean i-i know they cost a lot , but I am going to wear them all the time . you will see . besides , i love the compliments . i mean , have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it ? nice try ; I am keeping the boots . hey guys ! hey . ( sits down on the arm of the couch . ) see chandler ? I am getting a lot of use out of them already ! they are very practical . see , you can wear them with dresses , with skirts , with pants… ( almost crying ) they hurt so much ! the guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die ! i can not ! i spent so much money on them and i told chandler that I would wear them all the time , i just can not give them away ! i can not do that either ! the soles ’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood . ( standing up ) ahhhhhhhh ! oh nothing I am just—just was yawning . ( mimics the groan from before and stretches . ) honey , we do not really have to go to this thing tonight do we ? i-i do not-i do not think that I am going to wear the boots tonight . well y ’ know , I am just-I am just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money . or ! or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise ! anyway , i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the , and the boots do not really go with it . fine ! if you want me to wear the boots , I will wear the boots . in fact , I will go into my room right now and y ’ know try the outfit on . okay ?

( climbs back on his back . ) all right . ( to the boots ) bye boots—wait ! half off ? ! ( chandler runs off . ) sweetie , i think the glasses look great . they make you look really sexy . yeah ! of course !

I am going to be the mom that makes the world ’ s best chocolate chip cookies . oh , so you finally took it out of the marina huh ? what ? wow ! that is great ! dad must really like you , he does not ask just anyone to play . this is so cool , maybe this is something you can do every week . oh , just so you know , you-you have to let him win . he hates to lose . what is wrong phoebe ? no ! ! why did not you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original ? ! ! ( to chandler ) this is what happens when you do not register for gifts ! no ! wait ! i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie ! i do stuff like this at work all the time . yeah ! i bet i can do it . all right , i definitely taste nutmeg . you do not ? ( laughs ) well , that is the difference between a professional and a layman . hey ! how was sailing ? hey ! how was it ? oh my god chandler ! i can not believe it ! you gave my father a lap dance ! listen , I am sure that dad does not care . he probably thought this was funny ; he will be telling this story for years ! i was not escaping . i was trying to help out a squirrel . ( takes the phone from ross ) come on . ( answering phone ) hello ? ( listens ) I am sorry you have the wrong number . ( listens ) ( whispering ) okay , I will call you later dad . i love you . ( hangs up . ) okay , here is batch 22. ohh , maybe these ’ ll taste a little like your grandmother ’ s . this has a little bit of orange peel , but no nutmeg . okay . man , i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade . no , just a friday night . the ones we had right after you almost threw up . well , I have tried everything . i give up . i guess I am not going to be the mom who makes the world ’ s best chocolate cookies . i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe . kids love that right . well , i mean what about friends of your grandmother ’ s ? would not they have the recipe ? what was her name ? nestle tollhouse ? ! ( grabbing a bag of nestle tollhouse chocolate chips ) phoebe , is this the recipe ? ( tosses her the bag . ) i can not believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time ! yeah i am ! that is right . get it out of your system while we are alone . oh no , i already packed . the only thing i could not find though was your speedo . hey ! thank you . this is so great ! and I am going to be your baby ’ s aunt ! yeah , but I am the only one related by blood . well , what were you going to say ? hey ! good luck ! well i guess there is no harm in telling you now , rachel and ross are going to have a baby . i did not think you could keep it a secret . they are kissing let us just go around them . I am in love too ! but in an orderly fashion . ( to the couple ) hi ! can you do that and walk ? ‘ because she said , `` next . '' ( to chandler ) did you hear that ? ! they bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon ! come on ! let us act like we are on our honeymoon . grab my ass ! hi , sorry . i almost did not hear you , because y ’ know I am just so in love with my new husband . we are on our honeymoon . oh no , you see we are on our honeymoon . so umm , can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class ? you see , if we would gone around them like i said , we—she would have given us those tickets . damnit ! look at that ! look at that ! they are going into the first class lounge ! do you know what they have in there ? me neither ! we have to get in ! ( she runs through the door with chandler in tow . ) oh my god ! oranges ! fine .

I am sure she wants to live with you . well , no . but , um , i bet she probably does . I am sorry . but not that sorry , because you do not have to live with it . um , we have a reservation under the name chandler bing . ( pulling chandler away from the maitre d ' ) you need to give him money . no , to get a table ! places like are always shakin ’ you down . everybody wants to be paid off . you have got to be smooth about it . how did it go ? it is easy ! just keep it casual ! give him a kind word , shake his hand and give him the money ! i do not know . we would be eating our soup right now . ( sees two people exit ) okay , those people just left , come on ! quick ! give him the money and get their table ! it is not just the drum noise . every five minutes , joey throws his sticks in the air , and i have to hear , `` oh my eye ! oh god , my eye ! '' i mean , it is so annoying . phoebe , you got joey drums to annoy rachel , so she would not want to live there anymore ? what happened to santa , holiday armadillo ? wow , come in , have a seat . you must be exhausted coming all the way from…texas . because armadillos also wandered in the desert ? come on ben . okay ben , why do not you come open some more presents , and santa , the armadillo , and i have a little talk in the kitchen ? there is a sentence , i never thought I would say . ( to chandler ) hey , you think , you can keep it another night ? ( she has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling chandler 's beard . ) yes , is that okay ? no . ( shocked ) really ?

( joey nods ) ( standing up , walking towards him ) what is wrong ? so you are a little older . try to look at the positive : you have all this life experience . what are they ? ( they sit down again ) ah , come on , sneakers are easy . you wear sneakers all the time . okay , have you considered using a girl with huge knockers ? you okay ? ! ( bewildered ) how do you know a mugger ? ( shocked ) seriously ? ( disapproving ) phoebe , that is awful ! you are mother killed herself ! well , this must have brought back some really bad memories for you , ross . well , ross was mugged as a kid . ( coughing ) wonderwoman ! oh yeah ! what was his superpower again ? that is it . what ? yeah ? so ? oh my god ! hey ! what are you doing ? no , that seems about right . wow , that is a big cable bill ! huh , you do not have a job , but you have no problem ordering porn… on a saturday afternoon ? ! ( shocked ) i was in the house ! … that she was the huge guy that mugged you ? yah . … everybody we know ? yeah . oh no , wait ! joey ! happy new year . she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us . hey rach , maybe your resolution should be to umm , gossip less . well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs , i would . hi ben ! i like them . i like them a lot . it is my new year 's resolution ! no ! to take more pictures of all of us together . i mean i really think it is the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures . thank you .

( shows him ben 's picture . ) huh ? you are-you are a cowboy ! see ? ben does not think you are a loser , he thinks you are a cowboy ! now that is something . okay , now that everything 's wrapped up here , i think I am , I am going to go do my laundry . chandler , that is like your fourth cup of coffee ! he is in a different room ! he is really that loud ? y ’ know i used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper , and whenever i started to snore , he would just roll me over… he would just roll me over and i would stop snoring . have you guys picked a date yet ? ugh , she is upstairs not doing the dishes ! and i tell ya something ! I am not doing them this time ! i do not care if those dishes sit in the sink until they are all covered with—I will do them when i get home !

( goes to comfort her . ) hey , i bet you anything that he is going to call you again . again . y ’ know what ? i think we all did . hey ! ( she jumps up and throws emily ’ s wedding dress into rachel ’ s room . ) oh , i wish there was a job where i could wear this all the time . ( pause ) maybe someday , there will be . oh god ! he is going to come by and borrow some candles for his big date ! no-no , rachel , do not get it ! he can not see us ! ( closing the fridge in disgust ) shoot ! we are out of soda . really ? ! sweety , what are you talking about ? oh . ennnh .

( inspecting his leg ) wow ! and around the ankles , y'know that is a tough spot . we will try to be more careful okay ? it is just that , we do not want everyone to know because this is going really well , and maybe the reason it is going really well is because it is a secret . we are ! help us ! joey ! hey , phoebe ! okay , look , i-i have enough stuff for one more sandwich , i mean i was going to eat it myself , but ( motions that he can have it . ) phoebe , you are a bad ass ! phoebe ? yeah , the best you got in high school was wet pants geller . we are so sorry . okay , just wait , please . i promise we will come up with something . just give us a little more time . hey . okay , so umm , since that video camera thing did not work out uh , i thought that i would give you just a little preview .

I am talking about me having a baby . yeah . the great thing about the jam plan was , i was taking control of my life . so i asked myself , what is the most important thing to me in the world and that is when i came up with the baby plan . it took me 28 years to find one man that i want to spend my life with , if i have to wait another 28 years then , I will be 56 before i can have a baby , and that is just stupid . i do not need an actual man , just a couple of his best swimmers . and there , there are places you can go to get that stuff . ( entering from her bedroom ) okay , sperm donor number 03815 , come on down ! okay , he is 6 ' 2 '' , 170 pounds , and he describes himself as a male geena davis . you are going to what ? what ? ! why ? why is this crazy ? so this is not the ideal way to something .... lips moving , still talking . i mean it may not be ideal , but I am so ready . no , i-i-i see the way ben looks at you . it makes me ache , you know ? okay , all right , how is this ? 27. italian-american guy . he is an actor , born in queens . wow , big family , seven sisters , and he is the only .... boy .

'fraid so . brown hair , green eyes ... what ? really ? why ? hoyt ? really , is he a swimmer ? i like that . ( joey starts laughing ) what ? we do not have one of those signs . two girls and a boy ? and , and , and they wear those little water wings , you know . and they are , they are running around on the deck . then hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them . yeah . god , this adoption stuff is so overwhelming . there is inter-country adoption , dependency adoption .. there are so many ways to go , and this is like the biggest decision of our lives . hey . that is sweet . drink your hair . oh , they are brochures from different adoption agencies . that is not really how it works . i do not know ! thanks , that would be great . hey , honey , would not that be great ? hi frank . oh , my goodness , they have all gotten so big ! which one is which again ? thank you so much for seeing us . phoebe has told us such great things about you guys . well , we appreciate anything you can tell us . oh my god ! thank you . ( to chandler . ) i think i just had a tiny orgasm . it is .. it is just so pretty and white . can i adopt you ? they are in the kitchen getting something to eat . can you believe how nice they are ? why ? what did you do in the bathroom ? oh my god , where is my purse ? no , you know what ? i can replace everything in there . get that binder , and let us go ! hey , phoebs uhm , we just want to give you a heads-up . bill and colleen hate us . what ? who is denise ? okay listen , y ’ know when you move in rachel ’ s room is going to be empty , you want to talk about what we want to do with it ? okay , i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room , right ? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time ! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here ! ! okay , whatever , i really have not thought about it that much . no . oh , I am sorry . of course i mean that . interesting idea , umm , talk about it , but no . i just do not think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room . the beautiful guest room is going to be filled with antiques . what do you have against the beautiful guest room ? are you mocking me ? hi . stop it chandler . ( chandler is relieved ) I am sorry too . yeah ! oh yes ! listen , we do not have to make that a guest room , we can think of something to do with the room together . totally ! oh good . changes ? you are-you are-you are going to bring the barca lounger over here ? well , it is a set and they should probably stay together . see now-now you are taking them away from their home . yeah-yeah , y ’ know what ? yeah , that is it-that is it , everything will be mine ! nothing will be yours ! that is-that is what i said ! oh come on , chandler ! I am talking about the barca lounger ! it just , it does not match ! where is it going to go ? ! look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly ! ross , we can handle this . love is the best medicine . why do you do it ? yes . that is very funny ! ross , you were right before , it was just a stupid fight about a room . yeah , no , me neither . you still want to move in together right ? ross did not scare you ? come here , i want to show you something ! this is where i thought the barca lounger could go ! you see you could see the tv and it is still walking distance to the kitchen . okay ! uh-hmm . oh my god ! i love that ! uh , no ! ! hey ! also both of your sisters called and neither can make it . oh my god , your mother ! well , given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was . well it was not my fault , phoebe was in charge of the invitations ! ( interrupting her ) oh give it a rest ! okay , y ’ know what ? do not worry , okay ? we will take care of it . we will call her . just go home and get ready . go ! i have it in my book . go ! ( rachel leaves and monica calls mrs . green . ) ( to phoebe ) wait a minute ! if you are in charge of the invitations why am i the one who has to call her—hello mrs. green ! hi , it is monica geller . ( on phone ) hi , umm i know this is last minute , but we have decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for rachel today . yeah , I am sorry . I am-I am so sorry . ( to phoebe ) oh my god , my ass is sweating ! ( on phone ) please ! please ! can you come ? it is today at four . thank you . ( hangs up . ) son of a bitch ! ( calls mrs. green again . ) you ordered a stripper for the shower ? ! that is totally inappropriate ! hi ! yes , thank you so much . and again , we are so sorry . we could not feel worse about it . she is still mad . phoebe , sandra ’ s mad at you too . it-it does not bother you ? okay . i can do that . ( pause ) i got to go powder my ass . what ? i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me . that is right . that is right , you go over there and tell her you do not want her to live with you . do not take no for an answer ! ( to phoebe ) this is great ! now she is going to be mad at rachel ! y ’ know what ? and I am just going to swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had . yes ! yes ! and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby , because you are the most important person in this room . and in the world ! rachel , listen to your mother . she is very smart . it is going to be okay ! ( mrs. green glances over her shoulder and glares at monica while she heads for the bathroom . ) it was worth a shot . it is frightening . ( laughs ) you are still so funny . you are so funny . ( to phoebe ) what do i do ? y ’ know what ? you are-you are right . really ? okay ! i will ! mrs. green ? mrs. green ! ( she ignores monica and monica follows her out into the hall with phoebe in tow . ) it is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host ! yeah , and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it ! now what i did to you , it was not on purpose ! but what you are during to me now is just plain spiteful ! that is right ! maybe it is time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady ! so whenever you are ready to apologize to me , i will forgive you . good day ! ( monica and phoebe reenter the apartment and monica closes the door on a stunned mrs . green . ) i can not feel my legs ! yeah ? I am proud of me too . yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink ? okay . ( when phoebe turns around monica runs out into the hall after mrs . green . ) mrs. green ! okay I am really sorry ! ! I am apologizing for the— ( she trips and falls down the stairs . ) ( pause ) okay , i bit my tongue , but I am still really sorry ! I am glad you are here , we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony . uh , so anyway , we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony . okay , so ross will be doing the reading . do you mind telling us what it is ? what is dool ? who are they killing off ? she is my favorite character on dool . and the way she slaps all the time ! would not you love to do it just once ? ! ( raises her hand towards chandler . ) what is that ? it sounds like it is coming from across the street . what ? nooo ! ! no , there is no way ! it can not be ross ! ( she looks through the window and sees ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes . ) unbelievable ! why is your family scottish ? ! he can not play at our wedding ! i mean everyone will leave ! i mean come on , that is just noise ! it is not even a song ! do you want some shortbread ? eh that is scottish like you are . no ! no-no they are not . they are still very angry ! but y ’ know chandler is also half-swedish . you know what the swedish people are famous for ? sitting down and being quiet . ( interrupting ) you can not play bagpipes at the wedding ! ! ( entering with rachel ) oh my god ! it is true ! ! oh my god you are so amazing ! oh my god , can i just ask you to do me oh , just one favor ? would you slap me ? would you slap me right here in the face ? ! ( points to her cheek . ) ( breaks away ) oh wait , just one more thing ! one more minute !

( reading ) : ok ... dear ms. green ... yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... no .

( throws down her cards ) dammit , dammit , dammit ! hell no , we will pay ! and you know what ? we want a rematch . yeah , i know . he can get really competitive . what ? please ! i am not as bad as ross . that was not an incident ! i-i was gesturing , a-and the plate slipped out of my hand . you are kidding ! where ? where ? oh , rachel ! well , what is the job ? ok , look . that is aunt iris . this woman has been playing poker since she was five . you got to listen to every word she says . ( opens door ) hi ! i do not think so . what ? really ? uh , aunt iris ? this is phoebe , and that is rachel ... ok , great . you will tell us and we will laugh . let us play poker . ha , ha , very funny , very funny . but i think we would like to give poker another try . shall we , ladies ? you know what ? this is not over . we will play you again , and we will win , and you will lose , and you will beg , and we will laugh , and we will take every last dime you have , and you will hate yourselves forever . ok , we done with the chit-chat ? are we ready to play some serious poker ? excuse me , where are you going ? do you want to go to the bathroom , or do you want to play poker ? alright , cincinnati , no blinds , everybody ante . ( deals cards ) me too . ( slams down cards ) i hate this game ! sorry , rach . alright , check . rachel , there is nothing in it . ok , here you go . good luck . ( pointing at the drawing , upset ) bye ... bye ... birdie . that , you get ? that , you get ? hey hon , could you help me get the plates down ? no , i think we should save our china for something really special . like if the queen of england comes over . what if something gets broken , they are so expensive . ok , but if something gets broken , and then the queen comes over .. < laughs > oh yeah , like I am going to let you talk to the queen . careful . < hands chandler a china plate > careful . careful ! i know , after you left the store , i chose different ones . well no offense honey , but your taste is a little feminine for me . yeah oh my god , I am so moved . okay ! it is time for dinner . everyone we are using our fancy china .. um and its very expensive so please be careful . okay , just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved . < pinches ross ' arm > no , honey , its . that is a special plate . see its a game , whoever gets that plate wins . that was me . now see , this way you protect the plate .. and let us face it you have fun . that is not how you see me , is it ? hey . there you are . you disappeared after dinner . ross and rachel do not know what they are talking about . i mean its not like their so responsible . emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom . no you learn these things . you grow into it . i do not know it ! i want to have a kid with you because i think you are going to be an amazing dad ... at the fun parts and the hard parts . can you hear me say `` you are grounded '' ? how hard is it ? no shoes on the furniture . oh wait .. what are you doing ? oh how nice . maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress . put the plates in the boxes ! ! put the plates in the boxes ! uh huh .. i mean these things happen . its ' just a plate . its not like somebody died . i do not care . < pauses and realizes ... > oh my god . I have lost the will to scold . like only if the queen comes ? bye plates ! what ? something happened with the plates ? ( on phone ) okay , great ! bye . ( hangs up as chandler enters . ) so guess who is coming to thanksgiving dinner ? ( not amused by chandler ’ s joke ) i miss rachel . ( to chandler ) no , my parents . yeah , and y ’ know , if you could not mention to them that we live together , that would be great ! ( quickly trying to change subjects ) , i was thinking we would eat around four . because they do not know we are dating . ( again , trying to quickly change subjects . ) do you think we should eat in the kitchen ? ( goes to the sink and the stove to cook . ) um , well , i was going to , i-i-i really was . but um , then somewhere , just out of nowhere , i did not . ( trying to change subjects , excitedly ) so ! dinner in the kitchen around four ! I will see you then . ( pats chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room . ) well , um , because mainly , um , they do not like you . I am sorry . maybe because you used to be aloof , or that you are really sarcastic , or that , y ’ know , you joke around all the time . or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch . look , i know that i should have told them . i know i should not care what they think . I am sorry . you really think that will work ? ( hugging chandler ) i do not think you will ever get my parents that drunk ! nothing . no , sweetie , i-i trust you . you are not going to mess it up . well , it is done about two minutes before it looks like that . whoa whoa whoa ! where are you going ? oh , janine , the really hot dancer girl ? you are not going to go anywhere , you said you were going to eat here , and you are going to eat here ! dad [ kisses jack ] , mom [ kisses judy ] . look ! look who it is it is chandler ! dad , chandler was just laughing at your joke . y ’ know dad , chandler is one of ross ’ s very best friends ! mom , uh , chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is . ( shocked ) what ? mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you ( points to chandler ) were trying to get ross stoned ! ross , i can not believe you would do that ! you ! it is not like it is a big deal ! you-you do not still do it or anything ! dad , please do not pick your teeth out here ! alright , and if you are going to put your feet up , why do not you sit on the- ross , if you do not tell them , then i will ! really ? okay . ( faking joy . rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time , like joey said ) mmmm ! it is good ! it is so good , that i feel really selfish about being the only one who is eating it , that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is . especially ross . ( again , lying ) I am going to go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror , as i eat it . ross ? let us go . alright , you know what ? that is it . you have had your chance . ( out loud , to her parents ) mom ! dad ! ross smoked pot in college ! and dad , y ’ know that mailman that you got fired ? he did not steal your playboys ! ross did ! ross has not worked at the museum for a year ! ross married rachel in vegas ! and got divorced ! again ! ! ! ! well actually , i-i did not eat mine . it is still in the bathroom . yeah . ( to ross ) oh , by the way . would it be okay if i gave the toast to mom and dad this year ? yeah , I would really like to . yes ! every year ross makes the toast , and it is always really moving , and always makes them cry . well this year I am going to make them cry . no ! really ! any time ross makes a toast everyone cries , and hugs him , and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say , `` god , your brother . '' know what they will say this year ? `` god , you '' really you can do that ? oh I am working on my toast for the party , or as i like to call it . sob fest 2002. hey check this out .

( to chandler ) do you got the presents ? and I have got the car keys . yeah . he called the long island expressway a concrete miracle . it is just that , it is so much . i feel terrible . just going over my toast . those two will never know what hit ‘ them . i can not wait . they are going to be crying so hard . they are going to be fighting for breath . okay it is time for the toast ! umm now-now , i know that ross usually gives the toast , but this year I am going to do it . no , no it is going to be great . really ! mom , dad , when i got married , one of the things that made me sure i could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me . for that and so many other things i want to say thank you . i know i probably do not say it enough , but i love you . ( pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her . ) when i look around this room , I am-I am saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us . nana , my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here , but she can not because she is dead . as is our dog chi-chi . i mean look how cute she is . ( holds up the picture and pretends to cry again ) . was . ( to an old man by the stage . ) do me a favor and pass this to my parents . remember she is dead . okay , her and nana , gone . wow ! hey does anybody remember when debra winger had to say goodbye to her children in terms of endearment ? ( chandler covers his ears ) did not see that ? no movie fans ? ! you want to hear something sad ? the other day i was watching 60 minutes these orphans in romania , who have been so neglected , they were incapable of love . ( waits for people to cry , but does not get any tears . ) you people are made of stone ! here is to mom and dad ! whatever ! okay that is it . i give up . at mom and dad ’ s 40th anniversary , you are the one giving the speech . oh , come on . ( starts to cry ) oh good god , ross ! how the hell do you do it ? oh yeah , i remember mine ! ohh , it was my sixth birthday , my dad took me to the park , i got it , and…it bent . did the girl ever let you ride it ? making holiday candy for the neighbors . I am going to hang this basket ( points to the one sitting on the table ) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece . see ? this is exactly why I am making this candy . we can learn their names and get to know our neighbors . where you can make out with your assistant . oh yeah , what is the plan ? wow ! it took you all night to come up with that plan ? ! did you two… matt guire , mark lynn , ben wire… okay . the basket is totally empty ! my god , the neighbors ate all the candy ! joey ! ! did you eat all the neighbor candy ? ! they love my candy ? oh man ! ! ! I have got to go make more ! ! ( starts to do so . ) ross ! the neighbors ate all my candy ! ! ( turning a light on ) who is that ? ! hi . do you know what time it is ? oh please ! ( to chandler ) did you hear that ? little drops of heaven . umm , listen i am sorry , but I will put some out first thing in the morning . um-hmm . ross ! that is so sweet of you to get phoebe that bike ! when i heard the story , i almost cried . oh yeah ! i saw her walkin ’ it down the street the other day . she had uh , these flowers in the basket . it was so cute . umm , can we see you ride it ? see , this is why i told you never get involved with your assistant ! and here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs . ( to chandler ) did you hear that chandler ? no such thing ! I am sorry , i can not help you . see ? ( points to her new sign . ) rules are rules . no kidding , out of towners huh ? what did you tell ‘ them ? some people have been saying its y ’ know little drops of heaven , but whatever . ( still talking to the woman ) all right , I will do it just this once ! but you can not tell anybody ! ( closing the door ) it is unbelievable ! i-i can not believe that sign did not work ! hmm ? but they like it ! maybe . oh , you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh , funny man ? ( joey laughs but stops when chandler turns to glare at him . ) well , they are just going to have to wait are not they ? I have only got two hands ! ! no ! you do not know the system ! there will be nobody messing with the system ! ( opening the door and frantically ) okay , guys ! the candy is coming ; i just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool ! ( to chandler ) thank you . did you smoke ? I am fine now , but it was really scary there for a while . i mean , someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door . she sent the chicken back again ? ! well fine ! i want to meet this chicken expert ! send the colonel in ! ( to the lobster ) lucky bastard ! ( throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planet ’ s most annoying woman , next to dr. laura and kathy lee gifford of course . she is the most annoying female tv character however . ) janice . I am fine . oh… uh… well , she saw the ring . well , she was shocked when i told her , but then again so were most people . well , she actually has a boyfriend y ’ know herself , named clark . uh , she also kind of invited herself to our wedding . clark too . huh ? well , she corned me ! she asked if the wedding was in town ! i mean , what was i supposed to do ? ! come on ! so she comes to the wedding ! i mean it will not be so bad . oh my god , she is not going to like the chicken that night either is she ? ! really ? so-so you would have just lied ? would it really have been that easy ? good , so do it saturday night because we are going to dinner with her and clark . he might still show up . is that all ? it is actually going to be just family . what are we going to do ? janice , what umm , what are you doing here ? ( to chandler ) our kids are going to call her aunt janice are not they ? yeah , in-in-in the bathroom . we will just…we will just let her stay . kind of like your barca lounger . i never stop thinking about it . oh my god ! oh my god ! you have to go ! because chandler still has feelings for you ! that is right . that is right . and that is why you can not stay here tonight . and probably why you should not come to the wedding . i mean , i realize that his feelings may never completely go away , but you can . what are you talking about ? you were invited ? ! my god , i can not believe this ! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited , but i thought that was it ! i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable ! yeah , well you call her and tell her that y ’ know when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times , okay ? and if i had not have stopped her , there probably would not even be a wedding to go too . joey , that paper ’ s like a year old ! hey . limited seating ? ! ( screechingly ) i am just one tiny person ! ( disgusted ) limited seating ! oh , that is such a lame excuse ! that is not the reason she is not inviting me ! joan ? wait a minute , you got ross gellar and guest ? ! i was not invited and you got `` and guest ? ! '' wait a minute , y ’ know , you are bringing me ! why not ? ! because ! she is my cousin . i mean , we grew up together ! we are family y ’ know ? well that is important to me .

( frannie ’ s husband walks up . ) stuart ! oh wait i forgot my wrap . what are you doing ? ! come on chandler , come on , i can handle ross . ( they go to the door . ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain ; monica pushes his hand back . ) ( to ross ) hold on ! ( she opens the door . ) hey ross . what is up bro ? I am so sorry that you had to find out this way . I am sorry , but it is true , i love him too . guys , you are a few steps ahead of us . but what ? in that cute , little , sweet way she just did ? i know what you need , you need a bodyguard . hey ross , what is ben doing after preschool ? is not this great ? could not you just stay like this forever ? ( his eyes snap open . ) chandler ! could not you just stay here forever ? are you okay ? what-what are you doing ? man , i knew it ! i knew you were going to do this ! ! get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff . oh and you know what i want ! i do not have baby fever ! have you lost your mind ? chandler , this is not about me ! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap ! you do not know everything . did you know that I am going out with rachel tonight instead of you ? hmm ? and did you know that the only baby around here is you ? ! and did you know that i can not even look at you right now ? ! ( she storms out . ) gunther , can i get a coffee ( looks at chandler ) to go ? I am still not done not wanting to talk to you . what ? ! really ? I am really tired of being your relationship tutor . you are going to have to figure this one for yourself . all right ? y'know what ? if you are too afraid to be in a real relationship , then do not be in one . ( she walks out . ) ( raising her hand ) I am monica . okay . wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing ? ! no-no , do not-do not-do not do it ! chandler , why are you doing this ? chandler . do you umm , you really think the best reason to get married is because you are sorry ? ( kneels with him ) chandler , umm , i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds . honey ! do you know that none of that stuff came from me ? ! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now ! who ? two divorces and joey ? ! y'know what ? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own ? well , you are not ready for that . oh my god , what would have done if i said yes ? well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so , a long time . please , I am not going for anything . would you please go ? look julio , someone left their book here . oh yeah , what are you reading ? have i read it ? ( pause ) no , are you enjoying it ? your a poet and do not know it . ( she turns away and makes a face like ' i can not believe i just said that . ' ) oh , then you do know it .

( to chandler ) but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night . what are you talking about ? what ! ? you faked it ? you faked it ? you could not have faked it ! guys can fake it ? unbelievable . the one thing that is ours ! besides , why would you fake it when we are trying to have a baby ? like a month ? really , you want to wait a year ? i really want to have a baby . no , i want you to have a job that you love . not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration . it is just , i think , there is never going to be a right time to have a baby . i mean , now you are unemployed and in a little while you will find a new job that will keep you really busy . there is always going to be a reason not to do this , but i think once the baby comes , forget about all those reasons . it is going to be really scary . i mean , god . when we have a baby , there is going to be so much that we are not able to control . i mean , the apartment 's going to be a mess , i will not have time to clean it . what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer ? messes up all the ribbons ? ! what if there is no room for a ribbon drawer , because the baby 's stuff takes up all the space ! ? where will all the ribbons go ! ? ! yes , please ! i wish i could say the same . I am a little shook up ! ( entering ) hi . ooh , phoebe , you look great ! ( to ross ) ooh , are you going to do magic ? hang on a second i just got in . has somebody been drinking my fat ? ( joey and chandler look at each other ) rach , did you check the machine ? is-is-is that message old or new ?

I will will play my message for you guys , and you can tell me if it is breezy enough . i know the code to his answering machine . ( on machine ) `` hi , it is monica .

( on machine ) `` hi , uh , richard it is monica , um , listen i did something kind of crazy tonight , um , maybe I am getting my period or something , i do not know . '' nooo ! ! i do not know ! noooo ! ! ! ! maybe we could call the phone company . maybe they could change the message . maybe they can change his number . ok , i do not want to be negative so I will say that most of the signs you bought are good . ( looking at chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth ) so sexy . ( waking him up . ) honey . honey why do not you go lie down . phoebe did the signs ! phoebe ! but i could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket . wow , he is really not letting this go , is he ? breaks your heart does not it alright here is something , it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side . it worked ! umm , she rach , not it , she . oh my god , i am losing my mind . try feeding her again . i know , that is why i said again ! hey . okay what is up oh yeah ( smiles ) . what ? who says that ? what is going on ? excuse me ?

( she starts giving chandler a massage . ) no he is not ! what ? ! you have been lying to me ? i can not believe you would do that . but the minute we start to lie to each other… ( pauses after she realizes what she is saying . ) and by 'we ' i mean society . no . oh , please , stop ! look , we are supposed to be honest with each other . i-i just wish you could tell me—just say , `` i do not like your massages . '' ( starting to cry ) see ? it is no big deal . I am not crying about that ! I am crying about something that happened at work . ( bursting into tears ) my boyfriend said he did not like my massages . oh my god ! you do not know me at all ! I am crying here ! ! huh . so you are saying like umm , if there was an award for the best bad massage , well who would get that ? so maybe they could umm , call the award the monica ? okay . i suck ! y'know , joey , i think it is time to give up the bag . pete 's breaking up with me . i just checked my messages , and he said that when he gets back from atlanta , we need to talk . well that is it . people never say ` we need to talk ' unless it is something bad . really ? ! ( starting to get up ) i got to go water pete 's plants . ( stops ) y'know what , if he is going to break up with me , maybe i will not water his plants . yeah . which one do you like more ? okay , this is the den . all right , check this out . lights ! ( the lights turn on automatically , but are very bright ) whoa ! all right . less lights ! bad lights ! lights go away ! ( they dim ) oh , see you just need to find the right command . no-no-no , that is a video-phone . but hey guys you are not supposed to be here , so please , do not touch anything . i know . joey , put that down !

( rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement . ) i know it is a little sudden , and it is a little rushed , and it is totally not like me to do something like this , but that does not mean i can not . right ? i mean I am-I am crazy about pete , and i know that we want the same things , and when i thought about saying yes , it made me really happy . i know . ( pause ) i need more pie . ( goes and gets some ) so then , are you going to dump jason ? ooh , nice . oh , right ! i completely forgot about that . yeah ? wow . what is that ? okay . ( not sure of herself ) you want to what ? ! what are you talking about ? and i suppose you used a ring designer for that . my parents will be so happy . let me try .

( start annoying hyper-competitive mode now . ) ( jumping up ) what do not you just calm down phoebe ! all right ? ! why do not you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you are the only hot couple ! ! oh no , it is okay , i mean as long as you know that chandler and i are also very hot and fiery , just as hot as you ! i mean our flame , whew , is on fire ! you are so cute . ( she goes over and kisses him passionately . ) ( entering from the bathroom ) hey rach , a guy from ralph lauren called , you got a second interview ! yes ! a kiss ? what are you talking about ? he probably wants you back because you are right for the job . phoebe , do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight ? what are you doing ? ( that annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again , what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin ' episode ? ! ) oh , we are not seeing a movie ! oh umm , that is because i just wanted to y'know walk in on me and chandler while we were , y'know , doing it all night . will you excuse me for just a second ? okay . ( she gets up and walks over to chandler . ) chandler ? can i see you for a second ? okay . ( they walk away to get some privacy . ) we have got to beat them ! { here we go yet again . } because , gary and phoebe think they are a hotter couple than we are ! so ! so we have got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong ! phoebe and gary are so going to hear about this at dinner . we are the hottest ! huh ? no one is hotter than we are ! you are the best . no , you are the best . i am the best . ( looking out the window ) hey joey ! is not that the girl that waved at you the other day ? why ? what are you talking about ?

( gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying got to-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again . ) hi chandler . yes it is . you see I have always found the men 's bathroom very sexual . have not you ? come on , we can not let them win ! because phoebe and gary are in that-can not-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase ! i feel really sad that we are not…really there anymore . was not it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time ? really ? that is so sweet . i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm , i feel the same way . yeah . ( they hug . ) did not . okay , i freaked out a little . thank god ! i can not watch him anymore ! okay , look , this could be a really long game . ross , that is my jacket . ross , your little creature ’ s got the remote again . great . ah no , you see , someone was supposed to take them down around new year ’ s ... but obviously someone forgot . i can not believe you . you still have not told that girl she does not have a job yet ? congratulations , i think you have found the world ’ s thinnest argument .

( chandler dances . ) we will see you then ! ( listens ) okay ! what do you do with your money now ? joe ... emus are birds . you raise them for meat . joey , i think you should consider something a little less risky . i mean , i think in this market , real estate is your best investment.the fed . just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible . ( looks at chandler ) that is right , i know some stuff ! ( very excited ) oh , and you know who is selling a great apartment ? richard ! my dad told me . they play golf together . wow , the boyfriend 's parents ! that is a big step . they just going to love you , just be yourself . I am sorry honey , but we are going to take you shopping . it is going to be fine . you went out with wallis pincer ? i knew you did not get a 1400 ! ( monica looks at rachel in disbelief ) she said what ? what are you guys doing ? ( monica hears the moaning coming from the tv and looks at it ) oh my god , is that richard ? ( it only takes a split second for joey to realise , he pulls monica down by her jacket , and she falls , face down next to chandler . chandler gets up a bit , and joey quickly covers chandler 's eyes with his hand . ) so you stole that tape from richard 's apartment ? that tape was never meant to be seen by ... ( pauses ) joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private . why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it ? is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ? is not that sad ? i mean , can you see how pathetic that is ? you should not be jealous . you should feel bad for him . chandler , this is not our problem . we have got each other . that is all that matters . cowboy boots ? I have never worn cowboy boots in my whole life ! ( she turns on the video again ) that is not me ! that bastard taped over me ! ( chandler 's expression changes ) i-it is just so insulting ! big spring for a new blank tape , doctor ! ( not wanting to be left out , picks up something ) hey umm , what is this ? hey , joey , i do not think that you should leave chandler alone . i mean it is only been two days since he broke up with kathy . maybe you can go fishing next week ? what is phase two ? you stink ! uh-oh , what is the matter ? i do not know sweetie . i can not ! i have to work ! no , chandler ’ s still in phase one , and joey ’ s that thing you smell . i think she is here . ( looking out the peephole ) ohh , she is looking down the hall . oh ! she looked right at me ! oh wait , you can not see people through that little hole , can you ? ( goes back to the door . ) hello ! i-i-i think you look great . what ? oh my god ! oh wait , joey , you can not go like that ! you stink ! yeah . run ten blocks , that will help the smell . so ? how did it go with joshua last night ? what ? so you hit her in the face ? hey ! you are wearing pants ! it is 9:30 in the morning ! hello .

( coming back to the stage and sitting next to chandler ) okay , I have got some ones , you want to put them in her panties ? very good , ( getting up and sliding a one into the dancer ’ s hot pants ) so good . ( to the waitress ) when you get a sec , another round of daiquiris . oh ! and do not let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy . i think somebody needs another lap dance . ( motions for one . ) so , we did okay at the strip club , right ? what , he does not like josh ? yeah . and y ’ know , if you want to cry , that is okay too . come on ! chandler ! they really were pretty , were not they ? ( rachel and phoebe both agree ) oh , candy ! she was so spunky ! y ’ know , i think if i were going to be with a woman . ( chandler is intrigued . ) it would , it would be with someone like michelle , she was so oh , she was so petite . oh , chantal ! really ? ! that is-that is not phase three . hey ! wait , now , what am i doing again ? guys . i thought you were taking ross to the game ? no ! rachel is meeting us here . it is never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship . ( seeing her ) okay , let us go ! ! let us hit the road ! ! let us get the show on it ! oh rachel , i know the best coffee house and it is sooo close . we are sorry honey . very bad . chandler ! ! were not you nine ? ! we are really sorry , but um , she did ask us first . noo !

( running over to stop rachel ) hey rach , the tampons here are only a penny . let us stock up . ( takes her into the bathroom ) ( reading the sign ) what is ‘ pleh ’ ? huh . what is doofus spelled backwards ? i know , what about rachel ? i mean how are we even going to ask her ? umm , if ah , it might be okay if ross came skiing ? here we go again . ( shyly ) i do not know . what i said was , was that i understood . joey ’ s the one who agreed with you ! all right , we will call you when we get back . i can not believe you are not going to be here for christmas . it is so unfair , you do not even like your job ! it is just ... it is hard enough not seeing you during the week , but for christmas ... alright , if this is what you have to do , i understand . ( shocked ) you are not going to be here new year 's eve ? ? no ! come on ben . okay ben , why do not you come open some more presents , and santa , the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen ? there is a sentence I would never thought I would say . ( to chandler ) hey , you think , you can keep it another night ? ( she has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling chandler 's beard . ) yeah , is that okay ? no . hi honey ! we are all here ; we just want to wish you a merry christmas . so is it horrible ? is everybody working really hard ? wendy ? -- that sounds like a girl 's name . umhmm , umhmm , about the time you told me about new year 's eve . where is everybody else ? ohh , you are such a good boss ! is she pretty ? what does she do there ? she did what ? * what * ? ? alright , well , maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work . okay . okay ! merry christmas . really ? well , not anymore . i know , i just thought it would be fun . drunk enough that i know i want to do this . not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage . okay ! ( breaking the kiss ) y'know what is weird ? this does not feel weird ! you are a really good kisser . hm-hmm ! wow ! you are really fast ! we are going to see each other naked . do you want to do it at the same time ? one ! two ! eh , we were not that close anyway ! well uh , you and i are just goofing around , i thought , why not just goof around with him . i think you are better than you think you are . ( interrupting ) know when to stop . yeah . ( they kiss and as she starts to leave , chandler starts to dance . without turning around : ) do not do the dance . i can not get married until i get something old , something new , something borrowed , and something blue . you are so efficient . i love you ! no-no-no , wait ! we need something old ! that will work ! okay , now we just need something borrowed ! that is stealing ! ohh .

( they hug and kiss . ) oh , but wait , what about our , what about the future and stuff ? you thought about that ? how many kids were we going to have ? what else did you think about ?

( explaining to the others ) carol moved her stuff out today . ( to ross ) let me get you some coffee . no you do not . oh really , so that hysterical phone call i got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 a.m. , `` I will never have grandchildren , I will never have grandchildren .

( really embarrassed ) oh ! because , honey , i mean this in the sweetest way possible , nobody is going to want to watch that . hey , honey , my test is down the hall , are you sure you are going to be ok ? i know this is embarrassing , but nobody cares ! no one here even knows you ! hey , we are probably fertile , let us go home ! this was fun ! but I have got an invasive vaginal exam to get to ! ( leaves ) so , what is your name ? hey sweetie . with good news ? ( very quickly and wringing hands ) of course it is not good news , you just said ( deadpan ) `` doctor connelly just called '' . if it was good news you would have said ( excitedly ) `` doctor connelly just called ! `` but so what is it ? is there a problem , uh ? is there a problem with me or with you ? what ? oh ... what does that mean ? chandler ? ( weeping ) oh my god ! I am sorry too . ( still weeping ) i know . hey . oh my god ! you cleaned ! ( gasps ) look at these floors ! you did the windows ! oh , i have been begging you for months and you did ! you cleaned ! and nagging works ! oh no , was i cleaning in my sleep again ? well then who ? ( shocked ) i hope by maid you mean mistress , because if some other woman was here cleaning then… oh , relinquish is just a fancy word for lose ! did she really say that ? fine , i can do it . ( gets anxious . ) whew . well , usually when I am this anxious , i clean ! oh well umm , i make it myself ! it is two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice . and now the secret ingredient is…y ’ know what ? we just met . ( to chandler ) i love her . okay . ( as brenda exits monica notices something . ) she stole my jeans ! i have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them ! do not you see ? it is the perfect crime ! i will prove it to you ! okay ? about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch . now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain ! i guess . fine . I am just glad i did not give her my secret ingredient . yeah ! ( laughs . ) nice jeans ! oh . ( holds on to it . ) ( to herself ) you are not gettin ’ it . oh , i fell asleep . oh , will you do the top of the cabinets ? that will really work up your appetite for lunch . hello . I am sorry . I have never had a maid before , is this not okay ? hey ! umm , i think brenda needs a raise . because i put my head between her legs . they are my pants ! no ! i was just getting into position and then everything went dark . fine . ( brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way . ) she is wearing my bra ! my pink flowered bra ! i recognize the strap ! here is the plan ! okay ? I am going to leave you get a look at brenda ’ s bra ! i would do it but she thinks I am attracted to her ! did you not hear where my head was ? come on ! come on we are a team ! we are in this together ! do this for me ! come on , i catch you looking at woman ’ s breasts all the time ! do you see this ? ( mimics him drooling over a woman ’ s breasts . ) yes ! absolutely . okay ? look , you will know it is mine because on the right cup , the lacey part , there is a very noticeable rip . ( looking at rachel ’ s jeans ) where did you get those jeans ? ! no i did not ! oh no ! did you take my bra too ? ! the pink one with the flowers ? ! sounds about right . no , but he told me , he thinks your a fox . so , chandler , who is on your list ? first , i need a boyfriend , then i can have a list . hey ! where ‘ ya headin ’ in those pants ? 1982 ? why , what is wrong with my bathroom floor ? i highly doubt that . ( they both go to the bathroom ) i can not live like this ! what are we going to do ? what are we going to do ? that is a little more than i wanted to see . i can not leave it ! you gouged a hole in my dingy floor . you know that is nice , y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon ! what kind of karate is that ? so how is it going with you guys ? oh honey , we are close now but you-you would not believe the years of-of nugies , and wedgies , and flying wedgies , and atomic wedgies , and .... ( phoebe shakes her head like she does not understand ) that is where the waistband actually goes over your head . oh , we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game . oh , how do you play the shadow game ? i just asked you . no , that is what the game is . what is the matter ? he is retiling my floor . ( they both run to the bathroom ) ah-ah-ah , now you started this , you will finish it . it is beautiful ! it is like the first bathroom floor there ever was . ( chandler tries to go to the bathroom ) whoa ! are you going in there for ? and who laminated it ? are you serious ? ( they all look ) oh my god . why ? ‘ because otherwise you would go for it ? rach , are you really going to let him do this ? mom says it is all of manhattan , parts of brooklyn and queens , and they have no idea when it is coming back on . ( into phone ) pants and a sweater ? why , mom ? who am i going to meet in a blackout ? power company guys ? eligible looters ? could we talk about this later ? ok. ( hangs up ) hello ? ( to everyone ) it is chandler ! ( on phone ) are you ok ? what ? i have no idea what you just said . ok , I will go . ok , senior year of college ... on a pool table . oh my god ! what were you doing in a library ? you did not go ! outside . why not ? and that would be ? joey , what is going on ? about what ? oh my god ! i love him ! my surprise party ! oh stop it . joey already told me . no , you are not . we tell you stuff . ( to ross ) this is just bactine . it will not hurt . ( smitten ) hi ! hi ! hi ! if you want , I will do it . rachel ! you just put an empty carton back in the fridge ! have you ever taken out the trash ? ( hands her the garbage . ) third door on the left . god ! if you are going to cry about it ! ( she grabs the box and goes to through it out . ] joey , please do not do that . i think it is best that we just forget about it . ( picking up a card from chandler ’ s wallet . ) my god ! is this a gym card ? what is the matter ? so do them for free . wow ! and you got a petticure . your feet are all dressed up . you are going to do some feet flirtin ’ ! what a minute , what did he say ? i told you not to go down there ! rachel always cries ! now joey , you go down there and you suck up to him . i mean you suck like you have never sucked before ! his dancing partner ? ! oh , would you let it go already ? ! you are fine ! wait , now so you joined the gym ? well , you could actually go to the gym . well , next time your massaging him , you should try and distract yourself . hey-hey , how goes the dancing ? gay yet ? yes you did ! you did like a little hop . ( laughing harder ) you know the words ! you are so into this ! all right , then show me some manly moves . so you did not leave the bank ? oh my gosh ! ( interrupting ) i love it ! it is huge ! ! let us open it ! open it ! ! ( monica rips open the paper . ) oh my god ! oh well , maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom . all right . ( he goes to push it and it does not move . ) are you kidding ? ! i practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade ! this is like—oh my , this is like my second favorite game ! well i-i really do not remember the name of it . well , you just—you put a quarter in and y ’ know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something . do not feel bad for me ! i won like every time ! okay , I am next . ( phoebe starts another game . ) do not ! do not start another game ! i said I am next ! phoebe ! chandler ! phoebe ’ s hogging the game ! you only think it is stupid because you suck at it . no ! no-no ! i love it ! it is a great present ! in fact , why do not you go home and wait for the thank you card ? okay . phoebe that is it . come on , get out—out of the chair . get out ! ( she goes to move phoebe , but phoebe goes limp and monica can not move her . ) oh come…phoebe ! hey . well it clearly was not showering or shaving . wait a minute , you stayed home all day and played ms. pac-man while i went off to work like some kind of chump ? ! what is the matter with your hand ? chandler , why would you do that ? you think this is clever ? hey wait a minute , this one is not dirty . ah , well if you do not clear this off , you will not be getting one of those from me . but ben ’ s coming over here tomorrow to play this game , this can not be there . chandler ! he is seven ; he is not stupid . all right , look I am just going to unplug it . honey you-you got to beat your scores ! all right fine . fine , I will do it . I have just got to get this off the screen . carol and susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger . okay , i got that . I will escape over there . I will come back over here . all right , come on ms. pac-man . it is got—right— ( she dies . ) well , you are just a little bitch , are not you ? they are all chandler . but ben is coming over tonight and he can not see this . oh my god phoebe , you are on fire ! do not touch her ! ! i know ... god . i have not seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos . what happened to all our money ? i guess with you doing the internship , we are just spending more than we are bringing in . oh , but you are finally doing something that you love ! i can not ask you to give that up . though it would be nice if the thing that you love was y'know ... finding gold . ok worse case scenario is ... we borrow some money from my parents . why not ? wow ! i had no idea you had this much pride . hey joey ! listen ... i need to know that what I am about to ask you , will never get back to chandler . ( looks exasperated ) ok first of all ... it would be great . but that is not what I am here to talk to you about . i need to borrow some money . but chandler lent you money ! come on ... i just need it for some rent and .. and some other bills . two thousand dollars ? yeah ... anyway erm , are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff ? you are a pig . and you can not do this . well you know it is just like living with a girl . only they do not steal your makeup . unless they are playing `` this is what my sister would look like '' ( looks at chandler ) is that a bit you guys do ? we do not do that ! tell her we do not do that ! i hear wedding bells . do not you mean .. groomy ? i do not want her to get a boob job ! that is crazy ! so you gave in and decided to call someone ? thank you ? ok , you are being wierd . do you want sex or did you do something bad ? ok .. you know the old classics you know , you look nice ? they are still ok. okay ... i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger ? oh my god . we are trying to get pregnant so he is probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change . you heard him ! `` no bigger ! '' `` you are perfect ! '' `` just do not get any bigger ! '' oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach . you know what ? I am going to have to talk to chandler . honey ? about that ? erm ... I am going to change . I am going to get bigger ! well , my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not ! and you know what ? it is not just my breasts . my ass is going to get bigger too . it is kind of a package deal ! i thought i was something that we both wanted ! joey , chandler knows i borrowed the money . we are all sorry ... ( they have a group hug ) are you sure you want to do this ? whoa ! what are you guys doing here ? why else would we be here ? this is insane ! what are you talking about ? if you get married in vegas you are married everywhere . yeah ! hey . how do i tell chandler that it is too soon . it is going to break his heart , he is not going to think that i do not love him anymore . yes i do ! oh hi ! hi ! y ’ know , we were just talking about bacon . rach ! we were not going to miss our friends getting married ! what are you guys going to do ? so , what do you think we should do ? i know i love you ! ( they hug . ) that is a good question . look umm , last night we let the dice decide . maybe we should leave it up to fate again . i love you ! all right , eight we get married , but 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 we do not get married . okay . ( they approach the craps table . ) ready ? ( sarcastic ) come on eight . wow ! i can not believe i actually rolled an eight . wait a minute . that was not a hard eight ! last night i rolled a hard eight . i wanted it so bad ! ( pause ) want to go pack ? ohh , of course we are ! ( they walk up to the elevators . ) we left it up to fate . ( pushes the elevator button . ) if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign . ( the elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with chandler and monica standing side-by-side holding each other ’ s hands . ) that kid really kicked me hard on the plane . he took my snack ! okay ! oh god , y ’ know what ? it is really bad . this does not mean anything , does it ? okay . no , do not say it ! do not even think it ! I am sick of the signs ! it is too fast , I am happy the way things are ! i do not want things to change ! do you ? all right then , then nothing changes ! everything is great ! everything stays the same ! and you go unpack because it is been three days and it is driving me insane ! then all your stuff would be here . then you would be going back and forth all the time , i mean it does not make any sense . live together ? there have been no signs for that . yes ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! yes ! okay ! okay ! wait-wait-wait ! here is your key ( gets him one . ) here is your key . all right , you have to christen it ! now , go out and come back in ! ready ! wait ! oh my god ! i can not get out ! no , it is not a sign ! it is a very old key ! oh my god it is old ! i love you ! no . ( entering ) hey ! ( seeing the stack of newspapers ) oh my god ! look at all the newspapers ! it must be a good review ! is it great ? ! ( reading ) oh dear god ! what about the rest of manhattan ? ! oh my god , this is horrible ! I am so humiliated ! you do not think that umm , ( reading ) `` the chef ’ s mahi mahi was awful awful , '' is bad press ? is he right ? am i really—am i awful ? we said at the movies , but… joey ! ( he returns ) now that you are here… hey joey , come taste this . remember that guy that gave me a bad review ? well… ( feeds him a spoonful of what she is cooking . ) I am getting my revenge ! no . he teaches a course on food criticism at the new school , so before we go to the movies i want to go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again . oh , i can not wait to read the front page of the post tomorrow ! `` restaurant reviewer admits : i was wrong about monica . '' hi ! umm , I am monica geller , I am the chef at alessandro ’ s . i think the things that you said about me are really unfair , and i would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance . spoon ? ( hands him one and he tastes it . ) so , what do you think ? i can . well umm , they both have a egg yolk and butter base , but a bearnaise has shallots , shirvel , and most importantly tarragon . monica . okay . ( does so . ) oh no ! i do not know anything about cooking . i had to ask someone what it is called when the , when the water makes those little bubbles . i-i-I am sorry , your-your mouth was full , i did not hear what you said . umm , hats off to who now ? that is right . y ’ know , you called me that before so i-i took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil . now , no pressure , you like my cookies , you give me the star . ( hands it to her . ) wow ! a star ! ( the class glares at her . ) i know you all hate me and-and I am sorry , but i do not care . joey ! I am so proud of you ! excuse me ? he does not even know what he is doing ! i do ! I am a professional chef ! ( the class gasps . ) oh relax ! it is not a courtroom drama ! I am-I am sorry , it is just that umm… well i-i cook at this restaurant , alessandro ’ s , and umm i just got a really bad review… you do ? oh , I am totally crazy , but you-you like the food ? okay then , i do not stink . I am a good chef . okay . ( starts to leave . ) oh , look ! acting for beginners ! want to feel good about yourself ? okay . well at least , I am going to mute it . hi ! okay . hi . oh . why did not you take her ? you must feel horrible . hey ! the guys have free porn ! hey , cheer up ! you are going to see her again , right ? ( interrupting him ) no-no-no , do not-do not do the accent . you have got to see her again . because ! you could get to live out my fantasy ! no ! y ’ know , the fantasy ! meet someone from a strange land , fall in madly love , and spend the rest of your lives together . yeah that , plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything ! do you love her ? you love her ! ohhh , i knew you loved her ! then you need to go to the airport and tell her . you are probably just going to catch her just as she is about to go to the gate . you are going to call out her name and say , `` i love you ! '' and she is going to say , `` i love you , too ! '' and you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss , everyone at the gate will applaud . then you two can , can sneak into the cockpit , and things will start to heat up , and then a stewardess comes in… ( ross looks at her . ) I have been watching too much porn . where ya going ? how did it go with frank and alice ? ohh ! did you do what i said ? did-did-did you tell her ? and well , what did she say ? oh , you are totally welcome ! what did she say ? it is not over ! you are over ! you know ! it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you . and the reason why she could not , is because her feelings were so strong , it scared her . now you go home and wait for her call , she could be calling you from the plane ! come on now go ! go ! ( tries to push ross out the door . ) hey ! phoebe , they did not make you pay for those knives , did they ? are you sure ? this is not how it is supposed to go , there can not be another guy . of course there is another guy ! ! this is even more perfect ! now you have to prove your love ! you have to go to london ! yeah , you have to go fight for her ! when rachel was with paulo , what did you do ? you sat back and let him have her , you did not fight at all . am i right ? do you want the same thing to happen with emily ? all right then , go fight for her ! go to london ! i mean , that could be you and emily ! ( points to the tv . ) that , but-but nicer . just , go to london ! come on ! surprise her ! show up at her doorstep ! do not let her go without a fight ! all right . okay , good luck ! that is sounds great , but how are you going to afford it ? hello . oh my god ! ross , are you in england ? was emily surprised ? all right . when is , when is the next flight out ? okay , just stay there a couple more hours and if she does not show up by then , then just come on home . what are you doing here ? you can not be here ! oh , you came to tell him you love him ! i knew it ! ( points at chandler ) i was right ! ( points to emily ) I am right , right ? oh . hey , this afternoon you said you would be supportive ... i know , but what are we going to do ? she really needs this job . how is that going to happen ? you mean the guy who kept calling you ron ? hey phoebe . hey , tell me what you think . all right . the house next door to the one that we are buying in westchester ? just went on the market . i want to take a look at it , but chandler does not . but what if it is better than ours ? should we at least look ? that is terrible ! joey 's going to be * so * upset . seriously , you do not think we should tell him ? what if he reads it in the paper ? hi . we are buying the house next door , and we were wondering if we could just take a look around . thanks . ours is so much better ! this living room is smaller , the dining room looks like a cave ! what a hole ! love it ! they could be our neighbors , what are they like ? no , actually , we are buying the house next door . ( janice gasps ) ( looks confused and scared ) i do not know why . okay , the realtor said another couple made an offer . maybe the janice 's will not get it ! maybe the other couple will . ( thinks a little more ) okay , okay , ( clapping her hands ) all right . what if we got both houses ? huh ? we can turn this house into a guest house . okay , you come up with an idea . but we love our house . okay , but if we do not get this house , she is stil going to show up wherever we go ! i mean , at least if she is here , it eliminates the element of suprise . i mean , never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body . ( she shows this with her index finger , mimicking it pushing something up ) it is a stupid game and i was not playing against other people , so technically i did not lose . nobody cares about the dakotas . ( that is true in so many ways , trust me , I have lived in one and been to the other . ) because you invited your assistant . oh ! why did not you tell me ? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin . now you think i would not enjoy that , because it is so fake , ( laughs ) but i still do . all right , I am out of oven space . I am going to turn on joey 's . please , watch him ! do not let joey eat any of the food ! ( entering , to joey and rachel ) hey , did you guys know , that your oven does not work ? ross , I am going to use yours , okay ? chandler ? can you give me a hand ? ( grabs her jacket ) ross ’ s apartment is nice ! how come we do not hang out here more often ? that is my pie ! uh-oh ! uh-oh ! we left joey alone with the food ! ( walks towards the window and looks out ) yep ! yep , i knew it ! there he is ... feeding stuffing to a dog ! phoebe , why is there a dog in our apartment ? phoebe , there is a dog sitting on my couch ! yes there is ! he is black and white and shaggy and [ cut to monica ’ s apartment ] he is sitting next to rachel and licking rachel 's hand . I will be right there ! ( walks to phoebe 's door ) phoebe ! phoebe , open up ! oooh , i wish she could stay here , but chandler is allergic ! chandler , if that dog 's been here that long , and you have not had a reaction , maybe you are not allergic to this dog ? do not do what ? 1250. yeah . really ? I would say 3 to 4. when it is your assistant , i would say never . please , do not listen to joey , okay . would you look at him ? he-he is obviously depressed . he is away from his family ; he is spending thanksgiving with strangers . what he needs right now is for you to be his friend . okay phoebe , we should probably go back now . stop it . stop ! okay let us go . we can be strong . oh my god ! did you hear that ? she said monica ! ( she goes back to clunkers again ) oooh , i can not leave her ! that is not going to work . hey ! i did not know either . yeah , i knew . relax , ross . she is not made of ice cream ! hi , honey . what ? why , why would ... that is right , she came back all by herself . did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body , to have something else to do ? well , go over to her ! she is not with anyone . you could do that ! oh , right , right . how was your date , 'chand-lrr ' ? oh . I am sorry it did not work out . did not you listen to the story ? i mean , this is twisted ! how could you get involved with a woman like this ? what ? so you guys do not mind going out with someone else who is going out with someone else ? good for you , joey . we are kidding . c'mon , tell us ! ... oh ! i-i see you moved the green ottoman . how-how did that happen ? yeah , yeah , it is interesting .. but y'know what ? just for fun , let us see what it looked like in the old spot . ( she moves it . ) alright , just to compare . let us see . well , it looks good there too . let us just leave it there for a while . you guys , i am not that bad ! that is so unfair ! okay , so I am responsible , I am organised . but hey , i can be a kook . why not ? i could do that . why would someone do that ? ! ... one might wonder . stop it ! ! ... oh my god . it is true ! who am i ? well , what is the part ?

I am sorry , joey . I am going to go to bed , guys . ( determined ) uh-huh ! does not matter , I will get them tomorrow . or not . whenever . ( he goes to her room . ) ( hums for a while , then gives up , and in her head ) if it bothers you that much , just go out and get the shoes . no . do not do this . this is stupid ! i do not have to prove anything , I am going to go get them ... but then everyone will know . unless i get them , and then wake up really early and put them back ! ... i need help !

( chandler , who was almost asleep again , sits up straight in bed in an instant and can not believe what he just heard . ) maybe he did not give you a chance . oh , well ... that had been your window . really ? the scientist guy ? continue ... phoebe ! wow , is not it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys ? what are you going to do ? you have to tell david ! heeeeeey ! ( does not believe what she is hearing ) was your cabin pressurised ? no , it just remind me of something this guy did today at work . i told you about that funny guy , geoffrey , right ? well , he did this bit ... you probably had to be there , but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer , eating a raw chicken . ( phoebe bursts out in a laugh ) hi ! there you are . yeah ! i think that is great ! oh ... how are they ? yes ... what is the end of that sentence ? yeah , so ? is that why he is acting so weird ... ? he is jealous ... ? oh my god , that is crazy . it is not like I am attracted to geoffrey ... i can not believe he is that upset about this ... ohhh , ooohhh ... you are on a roll , mister ! okay , okay ... chandler you ... you stop it !

( looking out window ) oh , god help us . ugly naked guy 's laying kitchen tile . eww ! what is going on here ? you go out with tons of girls . thank you . so what does this bob guy look like ? is he tall ? short ? which ? you have never met bob , have you ? oh my god , joey , for all we know this guy could be horribly ... ... horribly attractive . I will be shutting up now . ( to joey ) he is so cute . ( to angela and bob ) so , where did you guys grow up ? how , how did that happen ? what ? I have got to tell you , bob is terrific . it is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny , and has an emotional age beyond , like eight . wow . my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity . something went wrong with underdog , and they could not get his head to inflate . so anyway , um , his head is like flopping down broadway , right , and I am just thinking ... how inappropriate this is . um , I have got something in my eye , uh , joey , could we check it in the light , please ? oh my god . hello ! were we at the same table ? it is like ... cocktails in appalachia . close ? she is got her tongue in his ear . joey , this is sick , it is disgusting , it is , it is—not really true , is it ? oh my god , what were you thinking ?

( turns around ) hi ! wow ! your lip went bald . ( richard pays the clerk ) hey , thanks . right . what ? ( removes them ) that is because i-i was just grabbing some things out of the dryer , and it is static cling . or maybe it is just that god knew I would be running into you and saw an opportunity . it is good to see you too . you see that guy ? he is in classics now , but y'know as soon as we leave he is going straight to the porn . yeah . me too . oh , um , i do not know if that is a good idea . no , i just i think that it is too soon . ( entering from her bedroom ) morning . yeah well , i ran into richard . oh , um , around 8:02. we ah , talked for a little while , and then um , we went out for an innocent burger . tomorrow night . it is not a date , okay . I am just going to teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has . we are not going to have sex ! okay , nothing ’ s changed here . he still does not want children and i still do , so that is why we are just going to be friends . you say ‘ thank you very much , ’ and then you buy me something pretty . come on , we are going to put are hands in this bowl , and we are going to start squishing the tomatoes . you touch people ’ s eyeballs every day and this feels weird . oops . got to keep squishing . okay . oh , gosh , you got some on your shirt . hold on a second , just put a little club soda on it ( does so ) and it should umm , be ..... umm , you have got some on your pants . so , how did the lasagne go over ?

( listens ) it is a word ! yeah , i do think it is better this way . ( listens ) yeah , we are being smart . ( gets up to answer the door ) ( listens ) yes , I am sure . ( she opens the door and it is richard ) I will call you back . ( starts kissing him ) so we can be friends who sleep together . sounds smart and healthy to me . so um , just out of curiosity , um , do you currently have any other racquetball buddies ? oh . no ! ( pushes him ) no ! ‘ because if you do that means you would be cancelling it for me , and we are just friends . hi . you would not believe my day ! i had to work two shifts , and then to top it off , i lost one of my fake boobs , ( opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast . ) in a grill fire . what are you smiling at ? yeah , right . i love this friend thing ! ow ! oh my god ! oh my god ! ( she frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as richard starts the tour . ) ( still hiding under the blankets ) so um , who was she ? ( still hiding under the blankets ) did you like her ? and I am just asking as a friend , because i am totally fine with this . ( gets up ) okay , y'know what , I am not fine , I am not . i mean how can i be fine , hearing you come in with her , she wants to see your bedroom .... ( pause ) y'know what , what if we are friends who do not see other people ? why not ? ! i mean this has been the most amazing week . would it be so terrible ? even if we were friends who lived together . or , maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends , and vowed to be friends forever . that is not true , you do not have a moustache . y'know what , I have got to walk out of here right now , ‘ because getting over you is the hardest thing that i have ever had to do . i do not think i could do it again . how ‘ bout one last game of racquetball ? watch the thorns ! happy birthday ! ! ! it is your birthday ! chocolate-chip pancakes ! they all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago . rach , you are in a great place in your life . come on , you have got a great job ! good friends… well , doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid , like ross . i can not believe you bought this . all right rach , for what it is worth , i think that you are doing great . i mean y ’ know let us face it , no one handles this well . were not you asked to leave sonny ? heyyy ! ! you got the door open ! ! ( giggles . ) nooo ! ( giggles ) okay . ( she tries to pull herself up by rachel and joey ’ s doorknob , but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment . she manages to catch herself . ) whoa ! ( stands up , unsteadily ) okay . see i was , i was a little nervous about turning ( whispering ) thirty . ( giggles . ) so the bus boys took me out for some drinks .

( growls and pulls him into a kiss . ) i-i-i want to thank you all for coming . my family and my friends… i really like to say that I am-um… ( pause ) y ’ know what I would really like to say ? I am drunk ! ! ( mrs. geller pulls the camera down . ) that is right mom and dad your little harmonica is hammered ! ! ( ross grabs the camera out of his dad ’ s hands . ) and guess what ! I have been drunk before ! and I have smoked a cigarette ! and i got a box of ding-dongs hidden in my underwear drawer ! it is all okay . it is okay because i turned thirty today . and , and i can do anything i want ! because i am a grown up . ( falls over sideways with ross filming the fall . ) phoebe , y ’ know why do not we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake ? oh man ! he is going to eat the cake ! ( sarcastically ) we ? and it has to go perfectly , because if she does not like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state . ok , so i think I am just about done here , unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere , like ... porn or cigarettes ? chandler ? ok , so there is not a magazine under the couch , or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank , or a filthy video in the vcr ? it is not mine ! oh my god , the adoption lady is early ! ok. we are waiting for the adoption lady , but , hey , I am glad you are here . i was cleaning this morning and i found this ( she puts a box on the table and opens it ) . i do not know if you want to use it , but… i told you ! i am not coming to a naked wedding ! that is crazy ! ( phoebe looks bewildered ) . i am sorry . i just can not imagine giving up my one wedding day like that ! that is right . you are making a commitment and that is the same , whether you do that at the plaza or , where are you going to do it ? ow ! ( chandler slaps her on her back ) oh , that sounds nice ! i am just there for jury duty . they really spruce that place up ! yay ! why not ! this is her wedding day , this is way more important than some stupid kids ! hi , i am monica and this is chandler . please come in . would you like something to drink ? ok. great . i am so glad that you are here . we are really excited about getting this process started . ah , thank you . this building does have a wholesome family feel to it . is that that couple on the first floor ? because we should get a baby before really ? what is it ? ohh ... that would not by any chance be ... joey tribbiani ? keep on roaming bert ! we do not want any crazy today ! oh , by the way , you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture , ( pulls laura into the spare room ) why do not i show you the baby 's room ? so that was the baby 's room . ( they come out and chandler throws joey behind ( to chandler ) what room should we see next ? ( laughs nervously as well , laura looks confused ) ( to laura ) some people do not yeah , that we totally understand . dating is hard . hello ... ? oh hi ... oh my god ... ! really ... ? i can not wait to tell chandler ... ok , goodbye . ( hangs up ) it was laura ... she gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list . now we just have to wait for a call and ... and someone tells us there is a baby waiting for us . oh ... ( she enters ) hey guys ! that place in vermont ? you can take a hint ! well , can not you just have the party when we get back ? well , I am sorry , but chandler and i could really use a weekend away . you know , to reconnect ... emotionally . all right , we will stay . we can just drive up after the party . believe me , that is not why we will not be doing that ! hey ! all right ... you are right . we are sorry . now let us wake up emma and get the fun time started ! are you freaking kidding me , green ? so glad you came ! i can not believe emma is still asleep !

( she gives joey a you-are-so-stupid-look ) ok , ten . ok , how about this : we got wind up toys for emma for her birthday . we can make them race , and whoever comes in last , stays ! everybody get your toys ! ( they all run toward the table with toys ) phoebe , you get the bear , uhm , joey , you get the robot , and chandler and i get the dog . ok , and the race is going to go ( takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them ) from here to here . now the one who comes in last , stays !

I am there ! you kissed him ? wait wait wait . i was at home the whole time . how did i missed that ? oh yeah ... so how did you end up kissing ? i thought you hated him ? so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy ? sounds like you need to think about what you want , talk to gavin , and you definitely should talk to ross no i told you i can not . what have you heard me sing ? what ? yeah i do rock that one . just a little but ... it is just so scary ! i do not even know what i would sing ... `` delta dawn '' wait wait ! i can not sing in front of all these people . hi !

( she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment ) you have not said anything ... oh .. please ! i-i welcome criticism . what musician ? what are you doing here ! great ! listen phoebe ... you know how much i love listening to your music , you know , but ... this is kind of a classy place . yeah . let me think . oh , when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese , and on our wedding night i ate his head . wow , do you mean like kiss him-kiss him ? what do you think brought than on ? a love scene ? with who ? olivia ? i thought she was marrying connor ! ( pause ) oh right , real life more important . i do not know . i mean , you saw him do a love scene , so maybe you do not have a thing for joey , maybe you have a thing for drake . of course it was ! trust me , when it comes to psychology i know what I am talking about . i took two psych classes in college . it was hard ! oh ... phoebe ? maybe i was not clear before . i really love listening to your music here , but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place . phoebe , it is not what you wear . it is sort of your songs ... i just do not think you should play at the restaurant anymore . i did not say your songs were not good enough . tiny portions ? phoebe , it is not about quantity . oh really , you want to talk about quality ? have you heard of a key ? it is what some people sing in . ok , so that is what we are doing . you know , when I am in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs , I am wearing ear plugs . you know what ? i take back what i said before . you keep playing at the restaurant , because with your music driving people inside , my bar sales are going up like crazy . thank god , it is just you ! i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall . ok , you have to stop playing now . oh yeah ? ok , let us settle this , come on ! ( to the restuarant customers ) excuse me , excuse me , hi , I am monica geller .. I am the head chef here .. ( pauses as if waiting for something ) .. ok , i was actually expecting a little applause there , but whatever ! ok , quick question : by a show of hands , how many of you were bothered by this woman 's singing outside ? ( a few people raise their hands ) alright , let me ask you this question : how many of you thought the music was fine , but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ? ( a few raise their hands again ) . ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ? ( a few raise their hands ) excuse us ! ( then to phoebe ) alright here is a question : who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ? ( raises her hand ) I am sorry ... ooohh ... hey ! want to stick around and I will whip you up some dinner ? ( without looking up from what she is doing ) besides tampons and salt ? ( then looks ) ooh ! my god ! maple candy ! that is so sweet of you . ( opens the box ) that is weird ... it is empty ! guys , hurry up ! the flight leaves in four hours ! it could take time to get a taxi ! there could be traffic ! the plane could leave early ! when we get to london , there could be a line at customs ! come on ! ! ( she runs back to her apartment . ) passport , check ! ( as she puts away each item , she says check . ) camera , check ! traveller ’ s cheques , check ! myself . y ’ know for remembering to pack a thing . yeah , you do a good thing , you get a check ! ( pause ) my mom does it , i never realized it was weird . hey ! yep ! you got the tickets ? okay , if you need the vacuum , it is in my closet on the left-hand side . ah , the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator… yeah , okay , give that a try ! all right , y ’ know what ? we really are late ! let us go ! let us go ! let us go ! ! chicken kiev ? yeah , y ’ know , but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken . and , you would not have to worry about the salmonella . ( ross pushes her . ) so , i can not wait to see this place you are getting married ! it is nice . ( entering ) okay , i talked to the guy with the shovel and i found out what happened . they torn it down a few days early . ( entering ) hey ! oh my god ! hey ! ( laughs ) yes , i did ! and you are welcome ! umm… she said that ? ! why ? ! oh my god . you are even dumber than i am ! ross , how long have you been planning this wedding ? emily has probably been planning it since she was five ! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head . that is what we did ! we dreamed about the perfect wedding , and the perfect place , with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake ( starting to cry ) , with the little people on top . ( ross gets thrown a box of kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one . ) thanks . but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was . sometimes we were . okay . you will see . and the musicians , look , they can go over here ( points to a little alcove ) , okay ? and the chairs can face this way ( points ) , and… ( points to ross ) you go . ohh . and i do not even have a date . hey . ha ha , a joke that is funny in all countries . ( looking nauseous from her parents kissing . ) and I am going to go get drunk . ( gets up to get a drink . ) i was laughing . ( patting him on the knee . ) well i did not want everyone to think i was stupid . my mother ’ s driving me crazy , but ross is getting married . I am happy . ( a drunken man approaches . ) I am not going to let anything spoil that . well , thanks , we like him . then why would he say it ? oh , my mother ’ s right . I am never going to get married . ohh , please ? ! I am a single mom , with a thirty year old son ! ! ( comes up for below the covers and looks concerned . ) do you think he knew i was here ? ( chandler quickly looks at monica not knowing what to say . ) ( in am uneasy voice . ) nope . ( she chuckles uneasily . ) yep , yep ... you ? well ... I would better get going . ( scoots towards the side of the bed . ) could you not look ? well , i love it . i only hope my wedding looks this good . ( angrily . ) you can let some of them go by ! ( judy and andrea go to the front of the chapel . joey approaches monica . ) ( awkwardly . ) why would i care where chandler is ? you know uhh ... you know sometimes i do not even like chandler . stupid . what were we thinking ? oh yeah . definitely . i have no idea . but look how much they spent ! i know . it is just such reckless spending . that is me . ross , you have got to do something about the humping . this woman 's living my life . she is living my life , and she is doing it better than me ! look at this , look . she buys tickets for plays that i want to see . she , she buys clothes from stores that I am intimidated by the sales people . she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies . yeah , well i might be if i had the supplies ! i mean , i could do all this stuff . only i do not . oh really ? okay , let us compare , shall we . do i go horseback riding in the park ? do i take classes at the new school ? this is so unfair ! she is got everything i want , and she does not have my mother . hi . ( on the phone ) hi , uh , yes , this is monica geller . um , i believe I am taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were . ( hushes her ) alright , great . thanks a lot .

I am mo- ... nana . yeah . it is dutch . um , pennsylvania dutch . y'know what ? after you are with this woman for like ten minutes , you forget all that . i mean , she is this astounding person , with this , with this amazing spirit . it was so wild . we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen . only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor ! ... they threw us out ! i was thrown out of a hotel ! me ! 'scuse me ? nononononono . think who you are dealing with here . i mean , I am not like you . i-i can not even stand in front of a tap class . what ? right . till i bought a blow dryer , then i was shunned . uh-huh . wow . then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire . yo- hooo ! monica and i just crashed an embassy party . noooo !

I am sorry , okay . it is just that chandler has somebody , and phoebe has somebody- i thought I would ask fun bobby . yeah . what is the matter ? vividly . hi . that thing is not coming in here .

( ross laughs . ) what are you laughing at pampers ? ( he stops laughing and glares at her . ) yeah ? ohh , absolutely . yeah , definitely ! then , I would steer clear of phoebe . well , because every time we do , you make jokes about swinging and scare them away . ross , we are kind of in the middle of diner here . no one wanted seconds , right ? i do not know who I am happiest for ... no , no . it felt nice to acknowledge this .

( chandler makes an agreeing-sound ) yess ! ! ( m & c high-five and zack looks confused again ) does seem pretty perfect . ( pause ) no . no , that is not it . it is just that when we were asking him all those questions before , i just ... i just realized i do not care if he is the most perfect guy in the world ... he is not you . no , he is not . and if i can not get pregnant with you , then i do not want to get pregnant by ... him or anyone else . yeah , I am sure . that is so sweet . i love you .

( looks very convinced about what she just said ) c'mon chandler , i think we have been given an opportunity . i mean , the mistake has already been made . they are writing up the paper right now . ( very emotional ) because ... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us . i mean , who knows how long it is going to take for someone else to give us a baby ? what if , what if no one ever picks us ? ( almost crying ) please .. please , we are so close . ( realizes chandler is right . she is almost crying ) okay , right . ( they hug ) ( sniffing ) maybe she will . uh ! why could not i have been a reverend ? technicality ! ( pointing to a picture on the table ) i-is ... is that a picture ? look , doctor ! yeah , but the important thing to know about us , is how much we would care for this little baby . ( holds up the sonogram ) well , we ... ( makes quotation signs in the air ) `` bore false witness '' ... see i could be a reverend . but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider ... well , you do not have to decide right now , but if you could just look at our file ... god bless you chandler bing ! no . i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident . I am going to get some tea . so it looks like it is going really well for you two , huh ? ( shocked ) oh my god ! i think that is so great ! when are you going to ask her ? i swear , i promise . i promise . oh my god , I am so excited ! { and i just can not hide it !

( realizes what she just did . ) ( sounding sick again ) wow ! uh , for a second there i thought i was really better , but I am not . ( hangs up and keeps throwing the ball . ) rach ? you have scratches all over you , what happened ? ( rachel 's arms are covered with scratches . ) ( shocked ) what ? ! i do not want a cat !

( runs out the door and everyone watches her leave . ) okay , guys , listen , do not forget that tomorrow is the day that emily gets married again , so whatever we do , just try to really keep ross 's mind off of it . hey ! hey ! oh , I am so glad you are home , i thought tonight we could finally organize these photos ! okay , I have broken them down into categories . okay , we have uh , we got holidays , birthdays , candids , y'know… and then what I have done is I have cross-referenced them by subject . right ? so if you are looking up , oh let us say birthdays and dogs , you get photo 152. see ? ( hands her the photo . ) you can also find him under umm , dog and dead . all right , hand me that other box of photos ; that is the very last one . i had not ! photo 152 was a prototype . all right , he is keys are in the drawer . y'know what ? i also need some cash . nah , while you are at ross 's if you see any lying around… what ? ! i-i-i do not , i do not do that ! ( on the answering machine ) rach ! it is me ! pick up ! i need a few more things to make the margaritas . uhh , i need some salt , some margarita mix , and tequila . see if he has ice . ( does rachel 's ) nooo ! well thank god you were here ! i mean , we have to erase that ! we have too ! i mean what if ross 's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together ? is that what you want ? ross back with that controlling , neurotic , crazy emily ? the emily that would not let him see you ? I am his sister , okay ? i love him ! i do not want to see him get hurt ! come on ! does not that give me the right to control him—help him ? no , look , she is obviously unstable , okay ? i mean she is thinking about running out on her wedding day . ( rachel slowly turns and glares at her . ) ( realizing what she just said . ) okay , fine ! but i mean , look at the position she is putting him in ! what is he going to do ? ross is going to run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage ? ! i mean , who would do that ? ! ( rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust . ) okay , fine , all right , but that is y'know , it is different ! although it did involve a lot of the same people . y'know what , this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she is trying to play on him . all right , i guess we should go . oh yeah right ! ( she grabs the money and shoves into her pocket . ) there is nothing we can do . you erased the message ! well , if you are going to be totally rational about this , i can not argue with you ! all right ? fine , if you want to tell him , tell him . i just do not want to be a part of it . wow ! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away ! man , i would be great in a war ! i mean , i really , i think i would make a fantastic military leader . i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys . joey ! congratulations ! wow ! i can not believe you are nominated for an emmy ! oh soap opera digest award ! honey ? is that something you are making up ? ( to joey ) okay , I will go ! really ? ( looks . ) my god , he is really cute . phoebe , I am engaged ! op , can i just tell you something ? very flattered but umm , I am engaged .

( leaves . ) hey ! how did your date go with jake ? okay , stop it phoebe , you are getting me all tingly . and did he ? okay-okay , i got it . i got it . oh , i have not had that feeling since i first started going out with chandler . wow , I am never going to have that feeling again am i ? no , a guy would be saying , `` I am never going to get to sleep with anyone else . '' oh my god ! I am never going to get to sleep with anyone else ! I have been so busy planning the wedding that i forgot about all the things that I would be giving up ! i mean , i…I am never going to have a first kiss again . phoebe , it is okay . you do not have to tip toe around me . i-I have been thinking about it and umm , y ’ know what ? I am okay about not having that new relationship feeling… see ? that is what i mean . i mean that , that is great ! but i would not trade in what i have for that . i mean I am going to be with chandler for the rest of my life , and that is what makes me happy . ( chandler approaches . ) hey sweetie , come here ! come sit down . hey phoebe and i were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful . it really is do not you think ? have you seen chandler ? ‘ because i just keeping thinking about all these things that I am not going to have and it is freaking me out . i do not know what to do about it . phoebe ! come on I am serious ! i just got to talk to him about all this . why ? you got to help me out here pheebs . so I am not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I am going to spend the rest of my life with ? your mother told you this ? the woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13 ? honey , as we get closer to the wedding , is there anything that you would like to talk about or share ? you are wrong ! the centerpieces are fine ! do you ever get scared at all ? does not it ever just freak you out that-that you are never going to be with anybody new again ? just , i love you so much . just…it is just sometimes it bothers me that I am never going to have that feeling . y ’ know when you meet someone for the first time and it is new and exciting ? y ’ know that rush ? okay , but all right you are a guy , does it not freak you that you are never going to sleep with anybody else ? even with me ? really ? come here ! come here !

I am going to have a lot of new things with you . the first time we buy a house . our first kid . our first grandkid… oh , this is so great . all right then .

( he goes to kiss her , but she stops him and rubs his head and says ... ) now get out of here you ! ! ( pete leaves ) ( to the gang ) okay , I am running out of places i can touch him ! look , is there something wrong with me ? i mean why am i only attracted to guys where there is no future ? either they are too old , or they are too young , and then there is pete who is-who is crazy about me , and who is absolutely perfect for me , and there is like zip going on ! i mean , seriously , does it sound like something is wrong with me ? ! sure . ( looks around ) well , with all these doctors and nurses , I am going to say , midget rodeo . okay . umm , y'know , i do not think , i do not think i told you this , but umm , i just got out of a really serious relationship . so i did tell you . okay , y'know , that really is not the thing . umm , the thing is that , right now I am just in a place in my life where i need to focus on me . y'know what i mean ? i so want to be attracted to you . I am sorry . it is not ? well , um , look i-i do not want this to come our wrong , but ah , you seem awfully confident for a guy i just told i was not attracted too . hey , rach , how was work ? by the way , ross dropped by a box of your stuff . something wrong ? still crying ? y ’ know , i only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up . and one of them is sex . i do not know , I have never had to use the other one . I am just saying y ’ know , if we are having sex , he is not going to be talking . oh , we have some… that did not work on mom , it is not going to work on us . no . well , you tell a lot of jokes ! ( relieved ) it is only you . so do you think that these pictures—are , are they trying to tell a story ? well , she is not going to find them lying in the grass like that . okay , I have got a question . if you had to pick one of us to date , who would it be ? me neither . what ? ! ( visibly upset ) she picked rachel . i mean , she tried to back out of it , but it was obvious . she picked rachel . it is wrong . you know what else is wrong ? phoebe picking rachel . that is a good idea . do you know what is a bad idea ? that is right . ( a noise comes from the living room . ) did you hear something ? it is coming from the living room . ( entering ) hey , you guys . ( laughing ) oh , do not you guys look cute . you guys make such a cute couple . ( laughing harder ) nothing , I am just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day . ( to phoebe ) remember , when you picked rachel over me ? that was funny . ( angrily ) it was not funny at all ! why would you do that ? why did not you pick me ? that is completely untrue . you think I am high maintenance ? okay , prove it . i want you to make a list and we are going to go through it point by point ! ( to phoebe ) you start working on that list . ( she grabs her coat and leaves , too . ) i know . where do you want to go eat ? I am sick of japanese . we are not going there . all right . no , thank you . joey , what are you doing ? joey , do you work here ? joey , what is going on . what did not you tell us you work here ? so , maybe i am a little high maintenance . and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover . but you know what we decided you are ? hah ! well , then , I am okay with being high maintenance . i am not high maintenance ! why do i have to decide ? i can not be fair . you are my boyfriend . okay , chandler , you go first . oh , wait , is he the guy i met at christmas ? do you want me to pick you ? ! continue . all right , I have heard enough . I have made my decision . you are both idiots . the joke is not funny , and it is offensive to women , and doctors , and monkeys ! you should not be arguing over who gets credit , you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world ! now let it go ! the joke sucks ! hi , chandler . there you are . hey , it is phoebe and rachel . um , why do not you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ? wait , wait , he came up with that himself . tell them , chandler . look , i am not high maintenance . i am not . chandler ! ahhh ! you are on my list . ( embarrassed ) ( to phoebe and rachel ) i did not even tell him to say that . ( they hug ) . all right you are off my list . ( sits next to him ) phoebe , it is okay that you do not want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend . i pick you , phoebe . yeah , you really should not .

( they look hopeful ) are you awake ? alright , we do not know that it is him . i mean , it could be the football guy . alright , let us say that it is him , would we not want the baby ? no ! would we treat him any differently ? how ? yeah , but maybe we are just over-reacting . nope , she does not have to , i found out who the father is . ( smiling ) no it is not . the thing we never do . oh my god ! why did they get divorced ? and what if i was still fat ? ( to chandler ) well , you would not be dating me , that is for sure . he is not boring ! he is just-he is just low key . thanks . oh no ! what is the matter ? okay . bye . maybe joey does not have to give you the money , tv stars have assistants right ? no joey ! chandler could be your assistant ! see , he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff ! hey phoebe ! guess what ? joey just hired chandler to be his assistant ! hey !

( runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas . ) all right , that is a little sketch of the cake , umm some sample menus , umm y'know what i thought we would start out with tuscan style finger food , and for music , here is an alphabetized list of all my cds !

( she is not ; she stands and walks away . chandler moves closer . ) ( overhearing that ) why do not you just go out with her ! chandler ! everyone -- no one 's eating my tuscan finger food because they are all filling up on phoebe 's snow cones ! y'know…go ! go ! right there ! ( points ) that is the surprise ! well , we-we had to go back because i forget my jacket . oh man ! i did it again ! what ? that is what it sounded like . umm . ( looks at chandler who is using the phone . ) umm . umm . i do not think so . umm , why do not you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I will tell you if it is true . harder than it sounds . is not it ? umm , listen there is something i think you should know . umm , actually i was about to tell you that i was , i was going to get out of it , but hey , if we are just goofing around then uh , maybe i will go out with him . feeling a little better sweetie ? me too .

( he sits at the table , then tries to secretly eat the gummi-bears . monica spots him . ) ok ... give me the gummi-bears . give them to me . no , give me the ... ( furious ) that is it ! dinner is over ! what ? why ? it is just that I have waited seven years for an opportunity like this , and you can not even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet ? i know ... it is just ... i thought this was , you know ... it . ( depressed ) that is right . I am no longer a bride . I will never be a bride again . now , I am just someone is wife ! oh yeah , right . ( rolls her eyes . ) that is not ‘ til thursday . they will not be ready for weeks . that is true !

( reading the bill ) champagne , strawberries…oh my god ! i can not believe chandler ordered porn on our wedding night ! hey ! no ! ( pause ) but , they are callin ’ out to me ! i mean this little guy ( holds up a small one ) even crawled up into my lap . oh come on , chandler would not mind if i opened just one present ! what do you think it is ? a tiny salt shaker ! ! ! oh wow ! okay . well that was fun . good . okay , I am just going to wait for chandler to open the rest of them . whew . although y ’ know , this is part of a salt and pepper set . i mean… i guess y ’ know it may just count as a half a present . what do you think ? or this one ! ( she grabs and starts to open the biggest present . ) hey , how are you feelin ’ ? any morning sickness ? no ! joey and ross do not know anything and chandler still thinks that phoebe ’ s pregnant . wow . y ’ know it is so weird . i mean , you are going to tell this guy today and he has no idea what is going to happen . what was that bam ? who is david lynn ? no ! no ! i should not have even opened these ! i mean i—joey i am out of control ! ! joey , you have to do me a favor . no matter what i say , no matter what i do , please do not let me open another present ! okay ? give me one more . oh my god ! joey ! you can not marry him ! phoebe ! she is not pregnant . it is rachel . rachel ’ s the one who is pregnant . phoebe i think he would notice if you did not have a baby in nine months ! there is a dude ? people have got to finish their stories ! ( throwing up the last present ) i do not know how any of these got opened ? ! i know ! i know ! i am a terrible person ! i mean , chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again ! yeah . what is that ? hey ! how did it go ? so are you ever going to tell whoever it is ? what ? ! great ! we are hangin ’ in the kitchen ! ( she drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room ) let us stay in the kitchen ! wow ! that is a great picture ! yeah ! oh and interesting because i found the cameras in one of our bags ! ( throws them into his chest . ) that would be a good idea . you kissed another woman ! okay ! ( they high-five and he walks out . ) of course ! joey would not let you have one ? hey , have you figured out a way to tell him you are moving out ? y ’ know , i really have to tell rachel , but i… we just have to get it over with ! y ’ know , the next time we see them we are just going to tell them . okay ? that is it . pretty much . hi ! joey , we have something to tell you . wait ! joey ! joey ! are you okay ? ! hey pheebs ! hey , have you seen rachel ? i have some pretty exciting news ! no ! chandler and i are moving in together ! hey ! well umm , chandler and i are moving in together . okay , come here ! ( phoebe joins them in the hug . ) okay , i got to go find rachel but umm , if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine does not seem so bad ? ( exits . ) ugh , i thought you were rachel ! i just tell her , i have to get it over with . i told ross and phoebe and she is the only one left ! no . have a seat . ( they sit at the table . ) okay , listen umm , chandler and i are going to live together , here . really ? ! yes , we are . ( chandler is frantically trying to get monica to correct her . ) yeah , he is going to work on that . ( singing ) we will be waiting for you… soon ! i-i just could not before . you saw how upset joey got ! i could not do that to her , she is my best friend ! I am not your best friend ? all right , all right , at least I am prepared . ( slapping his hand ) hey ! these are not for you ! are you upset ? rach , there is something uh , important i have to tell you . no ! but , I am throwing this shirt away ! i think there was a little misunderstanding before . umm , when i said that uh , that chandler and i wanted to umm , live together we meant alone together . oh no sweetie , no ! this is my fault , i was not clear ! I am really sorry . and listen , you take as much time as you need to move out okay ? there is absolutely no rush . okay . do not you want a cookie ? maybe , do you need a tissue ? i made them ! ( entering ) hi . so i , i told rachel it was just going to be the two of us . really well . yeah . surprisingly well . yeah , she did not cry . she was not angry or sad . ( sits down , slightly disgusted . ) i mean , all I am asking for is just a little emotion ! is that too much to ask after six years ? ! i mean what ? are-are-are rachel and i not as close as you guys ? ! i mean do we not have as much fun ? ! do not i deserve a few tears ? ! ! i mean we-we told joey , he cried his eyes out ! hey . so um , i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff . y ’ know , no point in dragging it out . dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore . hey rach , what about this ? ( she holds up a chrome 5-point star . ) huh ? who-who gets this ? see , i do not know if i want it because it might be y ’ know , too many memories ! i do not know . ( picks up a big plate from the coffee table . ) hey , rachel , you want the big plate ? i want you to have the big plate . something to remember me by ! but still , it is a big change . the end of an era , you might say ! I am fine ! i just , I am thinking how much it is an end of era . an era is defined as a significant period of time . now , it was significant to me , maybe it was not significant to you ! what is the matter with you ? ! ! why are not you more upset ? ! are not you going to be sad that we are not going to be living together anymore ? ! i mean are not you going to miss me at all ? ! what is hard to believe ? rachel , it is going to happen . chandler is going to move in here . no-no , wait ! just let me finish , okay ? this is not something that we just , we just impulsively decided in-in vegas , this is something we both really want . and it is going to happen . yeah , sweetie . no . I am going to miss you ! ( they hug . ) i know ! ok. but ehm ... what is it not ? and what else is it not ? very good ! ( gives him the keys ) what do you need it for anyway ? hey , maybe I will drive you up there ! I would like to buy some tickets myself ! yeah with chandler not getting paid , we could really use 300 million dollars . how do you know she is going to start talking ? god ! look at all these tickets ! it is so exciting ! you know i have not won anything since the sixth grade . oh ! you assume because i was heavy that is the only way i could win something ? ( smiling ) that was a good day ! I am parked in a garage on morton ! ( to ross ) so , did you come by to watch us win the big bucks ? chandler is supposed to find out if he is getting an assistent job at his ad agency . but out of the 15 interns , they are only hiring three . oh ! i hate that guy ! i mean come on kid ! pull up your pants ! hey that reminds me , i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work . alright , who wants to do it ? ok , hey rach ? well , it does not really matter ... you are both wishing for the same thing , right ? right ! .. but we `` know '' what you are wishing for ! i understand , but you are wishing for what we think you are wishing for , are not you ? you know what , ross ? I am going to throw in 50 bucks for you . because i know that you think the lottery is `` boohaki '' but we are all here and going to watch the numbers and have fun . and you are my brother , and i want you to be a part of this . hey , do not say that ! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job ! come on , lottery ! ! ( everybody cheers ) ok , here we go . we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we have won . so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this ? ( does not let them answer ) ok , how about this : we divide them into 6 groups of 40 , and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first . I am sorry , idea time is over . yeah . there are no tickets on the nightstand ! un , no you did not ! you must be mistaken ! chandler , sense the tone ! ! ok , fine ! ! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler . hey , you just got in 5 minutes ago ! when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic ! please ... if i win the lottery , you guys are not going to leave me . someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i could not get rid of you for 3 days ! ahhh ! ( shocked ) there is the man i married ! ! fine ! do not be my friends ! I will buy new friends ! yeah , and then I will pay for their plastic surgery so they would look just like you ! no , no ! we should divide them up ( picks up the bowl ) and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them ! money ! ( they all look at her ) friends ... they are all in there ! even these five that i hid in my bra ( takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to phoebe ) ... phoebe , we lost half of them . oh , play them ! oh god , i am so sorry honey ... ( she hugs chandler ) honey , you have been really strong about this , i know how badly you wanted that job . ( she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants ) 131 ! ( they kiss ) we are on a roll , people ! ! check your numbers ! make me rich ! make me rich ! ! just double checking ( does so ) ... no , no , no ... ( takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it ) no ! ( answering phone ) hello ? hold on . it is your boss . oh sweetie , I am so proud of you ! you bet ! no tv or anything ! ( she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area ) let me see ! you know what ? you can have mine . what ? ( trying not to laugh ) oh my god . yes . alright , well I am tearing the lettuce . oh-oh , no no do not worry , I am going to wash it . that is your call . well , i thought that i would cut up the tomatos . they ' r alright . no really , they are ok. actually , i was going to do them jullienne . I am outa here . [ monica leaves ] well , what happened ? was it ... ( startled ) ahh ! are not you dressed yet ? we are supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes . wh ? ! what about my allergies ? ! oh , stop beating yourself up ! people make mistakes ! these things happen ! there are not any message you have forgotten to give me are there ? ( chandler has a disgusted look on his face . ) apparently you are not very good at it ! i… y ’ know what ? he will forgive you . and i like to bring a pad with me when i go answer the phone just in case… ( chandler gets that disgusted look back . ) okay… you had no right to go out with him . you sold me out . yes you did . you absolutely sold me ... did you just flick me ? fine ! come on , no peeking ! ( they are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes . ) all right , umm , we are not going to really keep it this way though . ( to phoebe ) remember that guy from cooking school i told you about that put cilantro with everything ? well , I am going to fill in for him as food critic for the chelsea reporter . wow , monica ! what an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people . oh no-no-no , it is only one night a week , and plus i get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners . oh . all right , were you guys smoking something in the back of our van ? hey ! my first review is out ! all right , look at my on the back page . hey , they do not pay me a penny a word to make friends . oh ! do you need me to go with you ? have not we made this decision ? bye ! ( answering it ) who is it ? oh my god . oh my god , oh my god . ( on intercom ) call me on the phone ! look , i-I am never going to let you up so you may as well just go away . no ! phoebe ! i could not eat it ! i had five friends who could not eat it , and one of them eats books . the waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants ! all right , that I will retract . but i stand by my review , i know food and that was not it . you are marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice ! you should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery . oh my god ! you own an italian restaurant and you think that tastes good ? ! where are you even from ? hand me those tomatoes , I am going to show you what it should taste like ! come on , hand me them . okay , the owner of allesandro ’ s came over to yell at me , but instead i made him some sauce , and he offered me the job as head chef ! ! can you believe it ? i finally get to run my own kitchen ! you got the job ? ! why did not you tell me ? ohh ! umm , phoebe , i kind of need to talk to you about that . ( rachel excuses herself ) umm , well i-i-i think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering . i know , but now we have this second one and it just , it feels like it is snowballing , y ’ know ? i got offered the head chef job at allesandro ’ s . it is okay , ‘ because y'know what ? you do not really need me for the business . all right . but umm , i-i-I will pay you back all the money you invested , and you can keep the van . phoebe , wait a minute ! ( runs after her , leaving rachel alone ) ( entering ) ohh , here you are . y ’ know , I am-I am glad you decided to hear me out . I have been doing a lot of thinking . a lot ! and umm , well , i came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van . okay umm , you could be flower delivery person . or ! a bakery delivery person . pizza ? ! all right , I have got a whole bunch of uh-uh , stuff in this area , but umm , I am getting the feeling that you do not want to deliver . okay . I am guessing that if you do not want to deliver , you probably do not want to pick stuff up either . y ’ know what , let us do the catering business . yeah , y'know i-i made a commitment to you . y ’ know what , it would be , it would be fun . really ? ! thank you . umm , i just want to say , uh ( reads from a 3 x 5 card ) that with a pinch of exictement , a dash of hard work , a dollup of cooperation , we can have the recipe ... ( looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her ) are you going to kill me ? it is chandler ’ s way of pretending he did not take mime . yeah sure , nature called , she wanted to see who else did . you are on the phone ! come on ! ( the girls all run out and joey holds up chandler by smiling . ) oh well , it is not so bad . joey ! he is working ! ( to chandler ) you would look good in that . is not that mine ? ( pulling rachel back down ) yes , they can stay with us . hey ! wow ! so , now you are going on a date with this girl ? you are right , I am sorry . it is not like you are y ’ know , going out with an ex-girlfriend . you dated her ! all right , well why do not i go out with an ex-boyfriend and do joey a favor ? ! now , this is last minute so i want to apologize for the mess . okay ? i know ! now look , there is only one problem though . there is only room for one , so i guess one of you will have to stay at joey ’ s . so rach ! you are the first guest at hotel monica ! umm , you will just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning . and i thought i would bring them to you , y ’ know , in bed . oh , you have been through so much . now there you go ! i would not want my best guest to strain her eyes ! does that smell bother you ? well you let me know if you can , because y ’ know i can bake a pie to cover it . okay ! hello ? ( listens ) oh yes , one minute please . ( to phoebe ) it is for you . it is the fire inspector . so it is okay to date a student . well ross , you be careful now . you do not want to get a reputation as y ’ know professor mcnailshisstudents . joey that is so sweet . what ? ! you are going out with her again ! joey ! you did not even know her ! hey ! how is it going ? yes it has ! i made cookies ! but you should eat them now because they are hot from the oven .

I am just saying it is been a really long time for you . i mean , women have needs . do it , get yours ! all right , let us be practical , if ross is not willing to do it , he is not the only guy in the world you can have sex with . you can borrow chandler—chandler is good ! nothing . i just want the baby to be born today . okay fine ! i keep betting phoebe that you are going to have the baby and i do not want to lose again ! wait a minute ! now I am betting against all three of you ? oh , okay ! two hundred . that is it . I am done . i do not care when the baby comes , no more betting . hello ? ( listens ) uh-huh . ( listens ) uh-huh . ( listens ) okay .

( following her ) I will give you really good odds . you look cute in bubbles . chicken ? i could eat some chicken . wait , what that place , that pub he took us too ? bodington 's ! yeah , but her plane got delayed in athens . but actually , ( checks watch ) she should be here by now . no , but she likes me . you abandoned her on a plane to greece . rach , that is great ! it is so good that you had a good time in greece !

( monica covers her eyes in horror . ) sweetie ! edges ! fingers ! smudgey ! pictures ! okay . that is okay . i-i know that you are very upset right now . i know , i know that was not about me . if you would stop thinking about ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere ! i mean , look ! look , gunther ! ( gunther turns to listen in . ) i mean , he is nice , he is cute . ( interrupting ) oh , what about that guy over there ? ( she points at another guy and gunther is deflated . ) remember ? that is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time . you are going to talk to him ! y'know what ? we made a deal , i make your decisions and i say you are going to talk to him . we got out pictures back from london .

( phoebe nods her head ) oh , good . thanks . okay , all right do not judge me to much . okay ? um , but i saw this info-mercial , and um , i swear to you i have never-ever bought anything on tv before , except for this mop . but there was this stuff on leg waxing , it just , it looked so amazing .... yes ! have you seen it ? i know ! ! hello ! organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest ! did that ! okay . ( does so . ) ow ! ! ! ! ! ow-oh-oh ! no . it was painful . oh my god , they should call it pain-zine , now with a little wax . that is because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid . but hey , y'know if you do not believe me , please , by my guest . now , are you glad we did not start with the bikini strips ? ow ! ow ! ! ow ! ! it is okay , it is okay . we were just waxing our legs . that is right . what ? ( going over to listen at the door ) rachel said everything was okay . oh my god . oh ! ! ( hits chandler and joey in the head ) you guys knew about this and you did not tell us ? ! ( stopping him ) what , what are you doing ? you can not go out there . because they will know we have been listening . what if they do not ? hey . it is three in the morning . they do not know that I have come home yet . you notice how neither one of them are wondering where i am . ( airily ) hi . i just had the most amazing bath . wait , you like them with me . oh , baths are so relaxing ! how dirty do you think i am ? I am telling you , if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music , you would love it ! it would take all of your stress away . boy , do i have a surprise for you ! no , but someone is really not going to get over that idea , are they ? i drew you a bath ! please , could you just try it for me ? come on , i used all my best stuff ! i-i-i lit some candles . i put on some music . i used bath salts , plus bubble bath ! and got you this little plastic navy ship . so it is a boy bath ! i swear , if you try it , you will love it ! absolutely . bet i know how that discussion ’ s going to go . ( entering ) so ? i told you you were a bath person ! hey , when you get out , maybe i can give you a facial ! hello ? you know what ? i-i think I will wait out here . oh . ( she goes into the bathroom . ) what is wrong ? what ? okay , let us talk about something else . well , i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey . he was talking about rules and right and wrong and… you did ? what was he talking about ? ( groans ) that was a long night . okay , he was talking about rules . umm , and looking at people differently . what did he tell you ? okay . so you , me and london . looking at people differently . maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone . wait a minute ! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in ! and phoebe is his friend , so he thinks that would be breaking the rules ! just a minute ! ( to chandler ) that is mrs. tribbiani ! why would i say anything ? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives ! and they would have me to thank , and we could all start having babies ? you just stay here ! ( dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub ) oh , you had that ? i thought i lost it . i got a new one , like , a month ago . nothing . i mean , i-i , i really should not say . i mean , I am really not supposed to . it is a humdinger ! somebody likes you ! no ! it is joey ! is it something you would be interested in ? i guess that makes sense . so , you think you are going to talk to him ? not chandler , just joey . hey . yeah , I am going to take a bath . I am just going to get a magazine . what do you think you are doing ? i know that you are new at this , but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum . fine , you can have the bath , but i am taking your boat . now you are just a girl in a tub ! she pulled it out of me ! she is like a conversational wizard ! how did it go ? what ? ( pause ) i do not think I would care . oh my god ! a friend he is looking at differently , but it is wrong . it is rachel ! honey , cover it up with the boat ! it sure is nice to do this together , is not it ? I am not touching you . it is the salts . ( to herself ) whatever keeps you off the balcony , big guy ! would you stop staring at her ? what is the big deal with her ? maybe she is attractive in an obvious kind of way . yeah . hey , that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once . they have elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it is not so good . ( to chandler ) take me home ! ( they quickly leave ) hey rach ! ready for your birthday lunch ? pleased to meet you . so you are coming to rachel 's party tonight ? you were just being so nice to him ! right there ! that was so fake ! oh , you are welcome for the party . I am glad you are having a good time . does he ? maybe he is bothering you so much because he likes you . it is like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me ? would not kick her out of bed . no more vodka for me ! ( put her glass down ) hey rach , somebody got you shoes ! so this is what a stroke feels like . hey ! no way ! you had your party , now i have mine ! is everything alright ? well , at least you have one thing to be happy about . that jerk gavin from your office did not show up ( gavin shows up at the balcony windows ) . oh , we were not talking about you . no , no way to recover . ( from inside ) again , you are welcome . ohmygod ! rat baby ! rat baby ! rat baby ! ( screams from another room ) hey rach , the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us . thank you ! yeah , it is just we do not think of you as really being so much `` with the words '' . clearly we were wrong . you know what ? then , joey , we want you to do it . wow ! do not you look nice ? ! you guys do that ? chandler will not even have sex in our bathroom ! ( also reading it ) it does not make any sense . alright , what was this sentence originally ? ( shows the sentence to joey ) hey joey , i do not think we can use this . well , because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani ( joey makes a 'and-what is-wrong-with-that ' look ) . hey , why do not you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself ! oh , well , i bought chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song . oh my god , mike was going to propose ? maybe you do not need him to propose to you , maybe you can propose to him ! i proposed to chandler ! ( phoebe stops herself from laughing ) alright , moving on ... thank you . how about at a game , on the big screen ? what ? what ? he obviously thinks that is a nice way to be proposed to , plus he would never suspect it ! no , sorry sweety .. you dropped it off ? you hand-wrote it ? oh my god , oh my god , that letter is going to go in our file ! we are never going to get a kid . no , we are going to be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds ! okay good . ugh , we are screwed , are not we ? you know what ? just tell me on the way to the bird store . what ? ( surprised ) they thought joey was a child ? hey , what did you guys do today ? because there are so many terrible sights in this world . I am a cool , fun aunt ! you are so cute ! how did you get to be so cute ? okay , now you are even cuter ! ! what ? what are you talking about ? that is not possible ! I am sorry it is just , phoebe just always thought you were , you were charming in a , in a sexless kind of way . I am sorry , i think that you just misunderstood her . this bicep ? uhh , y'know actually i was going to do some laundry . hey chandler , want to do it with me ? okay . i mean i-i do not i think i have enough quarters . oh , is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it ? well what did you send ? bye ! actually , i did ! ohhh , oh my god ! oh my god ! she knows about us ! phoebe knows and she is just trying to freak us out ! that is the only explanation for it ! them ? ! who is them ? joey ! unless… oh man , they think they are so slick messing with us ! but see they do not know that we know that they know ! so… ( in the kitchen with chandler ) look at them , they are-they are panicked ! oh yeah ! all right , it will be great ! you just make her think you want to have sex with her ! it will totally freak her out ! relax , she-she is going to give in way before you do ! because you are on my team ! and my team always wins ! just go get some ! ( kisses him . ) go ! ( she runs to hide in the bathroom . ) she is bluffing ! you go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks ! of course . i love you too chandler . ( they kiss . ) well actually , ross does not . hey , i have all the space i need . just do what i did . y ’ know what ? i am really tired of your bellyaching ! okay , i-i worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live ! okay . shut up ! this place is a hole ! ( entering ) hey ! hey , guys , what-what should i wear to a knicks game ? yeah , apparently , they are pretty good seats . yeah , what , do you think we are stupid ? what do you say ? have you even had a girl up here ? ( entering with rachel ) all right boys , last chance for the tickets ! all right , so what do you say ? oh , just do it ! ! they are green ? that is not even a game ! you want to finish this right now ? all right , we get a deck of cards , high card wins . what do you say ? oh , good . okay . ( she picks a card . ) four . because we won our apartment back ! no ! ace is low ! ace , two , three , four ! but , we pick again ! we pick again ! i do not know ! we will discuss it , in the morning ! ( slams the door shut . ) no , we are not ! we are not leaving ! as a thank you , rachel and i will kiss for one minute . men are such idiots . yeah , let-let-let us pretend that is not true . what-what is going on ? when , when did—how , how did you… ( to ross ) i can not believe you are getting married ! I am telling you , she went to the airport , and she is going to go for it with ross ! guys , you got your hair cut . this is amazing . i mean , how , how did this happen ? ( to julie ) it is an expression . pheebes , you know what I am thinking ? no , although now that is what I am thinking . well , i was thinking , that you gave the guys such great haircuts , i thought , maybe you would like to do mine ? why not ? no you are not . sweetie , i wanted you to have him too . ( to phoebe ) please , just a little bit off the back . rachel , how did this happen ? honey , you are not pathetic , you are sad . my god , if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i had not ... ( everyone looks at her ) , but this is about your horrible mistake . ( to phoebe ) you know it is funny , the last time paulo was here , my hair was so much shorter and cuter . i promise . what ? i did not say anything . I am sorry . I am sorry , phoebe . it is just a little shorter than what we had discussed . how who wears it ? demi moore is not a he . that is dudley moore . i said i wanted it like demi moore . oh my god ! oh my god ! she is the actress that was in disclosure , indecent proposal , ghost ! i know ! even mary tyler moore would have been better . thank you . my hair is very amused . ( entering ) hey ! ( to chandler ) hey sweetie ! ( they kiss ) chandler gets pedicures ! there . here is their card . hey phoebe ! i know , amanda ! ah ! she called me too ! she is the worst ! she is this girl who used to live in the building before you did . then she moved to england and she picked up this fake british accent . on the machine this is her message . ( she apes amanda using an awful british accent ) `` monica , darling ! it is amanda calling ! '' ( pause ) ( to phoebe ) chandler gets pedicures ! i know , and she is always bragging about all the famous people she is met . oh , what are we going to do ! i do not want to see her ! ! what ? oh , i guess we could try that , but ... it seems so harsh ! ( to chandler ) have you ever done that ? ( to phoebe ) no , no , do not get it . let the machine pick up . it could be amanda ! you are from yonkers ! your last name is buffo-martisis ! we were not picking up , it is amanda ! hi amanda ! actually now ... it is ... is not a good time . dinner tomorrow night ?

( starts smiling ) i am scrappy . it is because I am scrappy . i will not know what i would do without you . well , i guess we should go back in . when you gave me another chance , i guess we should do the same for amanda . hey . i just talked to joey , i just—i want to see how you were . all right , i know you are hurting , and-and i want to be supportive , but do not say that again . honey , i do not think that is something we need to worry about ! first of all he is-he is never going to tell her how he feels about her . and even if he did you have no idea how she would react . joey…he is not even thinking about going after rachel ! no ! all he is thinking about is how you are taking this ! i mean , listen it is totally freaking him out . he is talking about moving to vermont . he says he wants to leave the country . ( pause ) he thinks you hate him . honey i can not even imagine how hard this must be for you . but , i do not want you to lose joey over it . and right now he just needs to know that you are still his friend . all right . now do it soon , he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money . hi ! so , what have you guys been doing ? i know ! what is this , 1985 ? ! not really . so don , what-what other restaurants do you like ? oh my god ! that is my restaurant , I am the chef there . no ! oh , I would like a latte . oh y ’ know what ? if you are going to talk about me , I am going to go with you .

( interrupting her ) okay , now thanksgiving 's over , let us get ready for christmas . who wants to go get a christmas tree ? ! hi , chandler . what-what is the matter ? is there , is there something on my dress ?

( excited ) i can do that ! umm , I would love too ! ( she goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow rachel 's advice and holds the box up to her cheek . ) ooh , i love macaroni and cheese . i love-i love the way this box feels against my cheek . boy , i love carrots ! oh ! ( she picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers . ) sometimes i like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while i talk to you . ( she is rubbing her hip with the carrots . ) umm , and-and-and y'know if i get really hot umm , i-i like to pick up this knife ( she picks up a knife without putting the box down . she is holding the box between her cheek and shoulder ) and-and umm , i-i put the cold steal against umm , ( pause ) my body . ( she does not have any exposed skin within reach of the knife , so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder , she rubs the knife on her stomach . ) oh yeah , of course . I am fine it is just that— ( she drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm , the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into chandler 's shoe . ) oh yes ! i have it right here , on ice ! ( she takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor . ) what ? ! what is it ? god , I am sorry ! I will go back and get it ! wait , no-no-no , i can go really fast ! dad , give me the keys to your porsche ! i did not mean to cut it off . it was an accident .

( she puts a shriner 's hat on the turkey . ) look ! ( she puts a big , yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird . ) i bet this will work ! ( she starts dancing and chandler cracks up . ) what ? you said you loved me ! i can not believe this ! yes , you did ! you love me ! what you guys do not understand is , for us , kissing is as important as any part of it . absolutely . ( taking a drink from joey ) are you through with that ? whose little ball of paper is this ? ! look , I am sorry , guys , i just do not want to give them any more ammunition than they already have . that is because as far as my parents are concerned , ross can do no wrong . y'see , he is the prince . apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born . what ? easy rach , we will find it . ( to all ) will not we ! you did not . i gave you one job ! ( starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan . ) ( puts down the lasagne ) i just ... can not do it . wow . that is not a happy hi . w-w-wh- ... wha- ... w-w-w- ... what does she mean by 'involved ' ? curry . I am sorry , why is this girl going to call me ? no mom , i do not have a restaurant , i work in a restaurant . ross , could you come and help me with the spaghetti , please ? i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish , but , were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing ? because i think it might take some of the heat off me . what is that supposed to mean ? no it is not . ( trying desperately to change the subject ) so , ross , what is going on with you ? any stories ? ( digs her elbow into his hand . ) no news , no little anecdotes to share with the folks ? boy , i know they say you can not change your parents , ... boy , if you could- ( to ross ) -I would want yours . chandler , you are an only child , right ? you do not have any of this . ( welling up ) mm-hmm . no . am not ! ( pushes him and starts to cry ) oh shut up ! joey let me ask you a question . what does this light switch do ? did not it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did ? they would not have put it there if it did not do something ! how can you not care ? janice ? ! how have you been ? done ? this switch thing has been driving me crazy . so i turned it off and checked every outlet . now , four of them do not work . which means , one of them has to be controlled by the switch . so , i plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise , so that way , when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is . yeah , well , I am using noise . okay . all right ! so , is everybody ready ? here we go . ( she flips on the switch and a hum starts . ) i hear something ! i hear something ! where is it ? ( they all start looking until rachel realises it is joey . ) he asked you out ? ! saucy ! electrical plans for the building . i know that switch does something , okay ? so-so i went down to city hall and got these . all i had to do was pay $ 25 and wait in line for three hours . hi ! oh , just some pictures i made and hung up . i thought they would brighten up the place . they do do not you think ? no-no-no , no ! i know that there is no hole there , i just really liked that picture . okay , but there is a wire back there ! i mean that switch is connected to something ! i just thought that if i could follow the wire i could find out what it did . no . it disappears back there behind that baseboard . for a minute there , i thought it went downstairs . but it did not . say hello to mrs. chatracus . all right . the super could not figure out what it did . a $ 200 an hour electrician could not figure out what it did . I have had seven pretty serious shocks . i officially give up . i guess joey was right , it does nothing . hey ! how cool is this ? ! we know three down ! I am touching three down ! ( she has her hand on his shoulder . ) three down knows I am married , what is three down doing ? ( to chandler ) you think we are being obvious ? joey ! you are doing great ! bye . ( they resume their previous positions . ) you can not say that ! ! you-you do not know ! ! i mean i thought i was going to pass out from the pain ! anyway i-i tried , but i-i could not ... bend that way . so ... ( looks at joey . ) you slept with her did not you ? joey , she was listing the countries she is done it in . ( watching a happy couple walk by , arm in arm ) would you look at them . am i ever going to find a boyfriend again ? i going to die an old maid . ( sarcastic ) thanks ! yeah right . you made a joke right ? so i laughed . well , no . you are chandler . y'know , chandler ! ( hits him on the arm ) well I would probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice . oh , hey ! oh good , you brought food ! seriously , where did you get the hat ? what is with all this sand ? ( picking a handful of sand off of the floor , which is covered in sand ) what ? ! what are you crazy ? ! aww , thank you . ( to phoebe ) so what is phoebe like ? ah no , the other phoebe , the one you went to go see . oh well , where is he ? ! ( gasps ) totally familiar . ( phoebe shows the rest of them . ) well , why would she lie to you ? strip happy days game ? i think I will help her out . ( she gets up to go over and help rachel , and reveals she has no pants . ) ( to rachel ) what is going on here ? you painting his toenails ? chasing him all around the room ? he is totally flirting with you too . huh ? you did not even take off your pants . what ? like a log . that is that weird voice again . hi ! oh that is great ! i mean think about all the money that you are going to make ! well , her father pays you for baby-sitting right ? oh , i love museums ! soakin ’ up all the culture . where do you want to start ? yeah ! this would be a beautiful place to get married , yeah , but i would not put the aisle there and i would never have the ceremony there ! ( points to both places . ) i mean you would have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch . ( the arch at the entrance to the room . ) what ? ! are you crazy ? ! I am not getting married ! I am not even engaged . well , i mean i guess there is no harm in putting my name down . phoebe , that stuff is… hi , honey . what ? i-i bought groceries , i was going to make you dinner ! oh no ! oh please , he did not hear it ! he did not hear it ! ! noooo ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! phoebe ! have you seen chandler ? ! the woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and chandler heard ! ( phoebe gasps . ) i know ! how bad is this ? ! i know ! i know ! and he totally freaked out and i can not find him anywhere ! well , I am never going to listen to you again , that is for sure ! ( mimicking her . ) `` y ’ know , harm can it do if you go and put your name down ? '' well rachel ’ s not here ! ( runs out . ) ( going over to him ) I am so sorry . please , stop freaking out . honey , we were at this beautiful place , and i-i-i just put our names down for fun ! i mean , what is the harm in that ? chandler , please do not think i was trying to pressure you . phoebe and rachel… it was a mistake . please do not take this to mean anything , because it does not . really ? i know ! i know . I am going to go tell joey that ( laughs ) that you are back . i was really worried about you . ( exits . ) ( entering ) hey ! ( congested ) ugh , they sent me home . they said i can not work if I am sick . I am not sick ! ! i do not get sick ! getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies ! ( wiping her nose ) i have not been sick in over three years ! ( sneezes . ) i do not need a tissue ! I am fine-d ! I am fine-d . I am fine-d ! y ’ know , it is a really hard word to say . rach ?

( wiping her nose ) are you saying that you do not want to get with this ? ( tries to do a little sexy body rub , but it does not work all that well with the big robe . ) ( in a sexy voice ) come on . ( coughs loudly . ) I am with you chandler ! i mean i can not have sex with a sick person either , that is disgusting ! but I am not sick ! let me prove it to you . we are two healthy people in the pribe of libe .

( sneezes . ) I am fine . ( she goes into one of those half sneezing , half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu . ) ( entering ) chandler , i think I am sick . okay , fine i admit it ! i feel terrible ! would you please rub this on my chest ? ( she hands him some of that vicks vap-of-rub to put on . ) come on ! i really need your help ! fine , I will rub it on myself . yeah ? are you kidding me ? ! is this ; is this turning you on ? i can not believe it ! what is it ? is it the rubbing or the smell ? not now , I am sick ! what happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people ? okay , if you really want to have sex… worked like a charm . ( calling from the bathroom ) is someone there ? ( entering with chandler ) who ? ( she looks out the window at ross ’ s apartment ) is that your sister ? god , ross is on a date with your sister ! how weird is that ? ! oh no it is not , no it is not . it is a first date . I am sure that nothing is going to… ( as she is talking we see ross close his drapes . ) ( entering ) hey ! oh , yeah . yes ! why , did you—you forget to make yours ? okay . ( they kiss . ) okay , i can not wait ! this is going to be the best valentine ’ s day ever ! ( chandler giggles and exits . ) i can not believe it ! make the presents ! make the presents ! I am just so excited to make the presents ! ( chandler does another sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves . ) shoot ! sure ! okay , you go first . okay !

( points to the bedroom . ) oops ! ( covers its eyes . ) y ’ know , your birthday is in a month-and-a-half , what do you say i forget to get you a present for that too ? we have got to wash that ! ( referring to the sock bunny . ) do you remember that jacket that you love so much , that you thought was too expensive ? i want to wake up early and go get it for you ! oop , your cake is ready ! who the hell are you ? ! the only problem ! hey ! continuing the countdown of your favorite meals . tonight , no . 3 , macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs . i will ! but not tonight . for dinner music , i thought we could listen to that tape you made me . the way you look tonight is on here ! dance with me ? you are just the sweetest .

( holds out a spoon for him . ) what is going on with you ? what was the dream about ? wait , joey ! joey ! that does not mean that-that you are in love with me ! no ! or , it could mean that-that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too . um-hmm . well sure ! I am just wearing sweats ! ( looking at chandler and slowly realizing what his point is . ) but that is good that you are not in love with me , because you just want a girlfriend ! you become friends after ? ( laughing ) that is right . joey , i thought you were going to try to be friends first ! what about the closeness ? who is it ? you are kidding ! ross ! joey , why do not you put them in the lost and found ? oh my god , what a fun day ! that sounds great ! do not worry about it phoebe , we will absolutely do it . come on chandler , come on ! it will give us great practice for when— ( realizes what she is about to say and changes ) —people with babies come to visit . pheebs , how is it going ? nope , sound like me . pheebs , it is going great . look at chandler with little baby girl chandler . what do you mean ? this is so great ! this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant . oh yeah , i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound . i know . but umm , one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building , so i washed it . and six others . yeah , two hours , a lifetime that is the same . chandler , what are you doing ? that thing can put someone is eye out ! oh it is so cute . i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head . how are you still single ? ! good . what made you change your mind ? damnit ! y ’ know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and , and no one was watching chandler ! ( he does it again . ) and people will think you own a porsche because you are wearing the clothes ? joey , you know you do not actually have one . all right , that is it , we are going to the emergency room . the babies are asleep , I am sure you will be okay on your own for a while ! he is got something plastic lodged in his throat , we have got to go to the hospital . oh my god . phoebe , what , what happened here ? ! but my apartment ! but the mess ! you are right , you are right i should not freak out . ‘ because this is what will happen when you and i have babies ! when will that be ? ! ( entering from her bedroom ) how desperate am i ? i just told my mom I would cater a party for her . because i need the money , and i thought that it would be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect . you do not have to stick up for her . she can not here you . doing great , the quiches are coming along . yeah , i thought it was cute . let me ask you a question . why did you hire me ? ( to phoebe ) oh my god ! did you hear that ? she hired me because she thinks I am good . oh yeah , she did not hire me out of pity , it was not so she could pick on me in front of her friends , she actually thinks I am good . …i think he deserves a nobel prize . ( joey starts to nod ‘ yes. ’ ) what ? oh , i know , i never wear fake ones . i just did it so my mom would not give me grief about me biting them . ( looks at her nails ) oh my god . wait a minute , i had them put… ( realises ) oh my god ! it is in the quiche ! oh my god ! okay ah , please do not freak out . umm , but ah , there is a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups , and there is no way to know which one . then why are you laughing ? what ? you bet I would lose a nail ? frozen lasagnas ? you bet that I would screw up ? ! so all that stuff about hiring me because i was good was… you promised dr. weinburg , you would never use that phrase . ( laughs ) that is right . my mom does not have any faith in me ! oh , that is hilarious ! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha . ( interrupting ) no ! you have lasagnas ! ( storms out and an awkward silence follows . ) hi . ohh , I am such an idiot . i can not believe i actually thought she could change . oh good , I am glad that is catching on . what ? ( getting up ) all right , I will go down there . but , I am not going to serve the lasagna . I am going to serve something i make . well ? really ? ! yes ! ! and you ? so if everyone liked it , and you liked it , that would make this a success . which would make you… well , i was going for wrong , but we can use your word . wow ! that really means a lot . oh , and mom , do not bite your nails . ( in a sexy voice ) hello , chandler . ( phoebe has a huge smile on her face . ) why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden ? oh ! did anybody see that-that documentary on the korean war ? ( joey is pissed ) ( recognizing him and panicking ) no you do not ! I am sorry , they surprised me . there was nothing i could do ! ugh , i knew giving you that book was going to come back and bite me in the ass ! ( entering ) oh my god ! you are going to love me so much ! i felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing , so tonight you are going to have a bachelor party . yeah , i got this number from this guy at work and i hired a stripper to come dance for you . am i going in the wife hall of fame or what ? ! come on ! come on , it will be fun ! it will make me feel so much better . so do not think of it as a bachelor party , think of it as a…a two month anniversary present . please ! i feel so bad ! just watch the hot woman get naked ! thank you . all right , now who else do you want to invite ? yeah ! hey ! thanks for getting me that girl ’ s number . my husband . she is a stripper . is that , is that what they call strippers sometimes ? oh my god stu ! i-i can not believe you did this ! now are you absolutely sure she is a hooker ?

I am going to make this up to you . i promised you a stripper ( turns on the radio ) , and you are going to get a stripper . ( she starts to strip . ) what ? ooh , these tennis shoes are so tight . i think I will take them off . ( goes to do so . ) gotcha sailor . ( kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down , but she continues to strip . ) ( entering from the bathroom ) hey ! happy anniversary ! so umm , when i was in the shower i was thinking about our first night in london… is that the one that speaks english or the one that does not ? that was some hot love you gave me !

( entering from her room ) oww ! i do not know , my hand feels weird . i guess it is because , I am engaged ! ( shows off the ring . ) how long before it starts getting annoying ? okay ! ( runs off . ) ( returning ) okay ! ( sets down a huge 3 '' 3-ring binder on the table . ) this baby has got everything . take y ’ know , locations for instance .

( holds up a picture of each . ) oh my god ! it is like one mind . oh dad , really you do not need to… well , at least you are not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party . anyway , we are really excited about our wedding plans , and well i guess pretty soon we will be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund . ( chandler and her laugh , but her parents do not . ) what ? what happened ? you still have the monica wedding fund do not you ? i do not believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house ! you bought the beach house when i was 23 ! what about when i started dating chandler ? i can not believe it ! that there is no money for my wedding ? ! i can not believe this . do you think that your parents could help pay for it ? my parents spent the money for our wedding ! no ! no it is not ! it is not going to be okay ! it sucks ! no swing band ! no lilies ! how ? i do not have any money . how much ? whoa ! ! ! are you kidding me ? ! it is enough for wedding scenario eight . ( to chandler ) how great are you , you little saver ? ! i mean , the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding ! this is the most special day of our lives . honey , umm i-i love you , ( laughs ) but umm , if you call our wedding a party one more time , you may not get invited . okay ? ( laughs ) listen , we could always earn more money , okay ? but uh , we are only going to get married once . you-you are going to have to put your foot down ? hey . listen umm , I have been thinking , it is not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding . i mean , you work , you work really hard for that . eh , you work for that . you do ? ! oh , you are so sweet . ( they hug and kiss . ) oh , but wait , what about our , what about the future and stuff ? you thought about that ? how many kids were we going to have ? what else did you think about ?

( chandler turns around in horror . ) ( seeing him ) rachel ’ s ! but good to know where you are at ! hey ! you too ! actually there is . chandler usually helps me with this , but he is really into the game so i do not want to bother him . could you help me fold these napkins ?

( breaking it up ) uh rachel ? rachel , why do not you sit here ? ( next to joey ) and will you sit way over there . ( the other side of the table . ) ( laughs ) this is chandler ’ s chicken . this is the turkey . ( sets down a huge turkey . ) about nineteen pounds . ( to rachel ) apparently you were umm , a little mean to him in high school . oh will . but you-you have worked so hard… okay . ( chandler grabs the dish from monica and hands it to will who starts dishing out a large helping . ) i swear i did not . ( to ross and will ) hey ! is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door ? hmm , a little relieved , i got to say . you started that ? ! everyone at our school heard it ! i thought it might be true . and i was afraid that you were going to cry and then show it to me . joey , you do not have to finish that . oh ! me too ! that is not totally true . well you-you did start that rumor about ross making out with mrs. altman , our 50-year-old librarian . it is true ? ! ! did not she walk with a cane ? all right , listen you are just being silly . rachel , even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you . one girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll ! and ross , if it were not for rachel ’ s rumor i mean no one in high school would even know who you were . she put you on the map ! hey ! mrs. altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty . hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past . you-you have been through so much since then . and right now you have got so much more important stuff going on in your life . can not you just let this go ? well joey , we are all…we are all very proud of you . yeah , you want some ? ( to chandler ) you are going to make a joke about my special present ! why would you do that ? ! i think our lover ’ s spat will start a little early this month . we know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be . ross ! ! how crazy that we would run into you ! ( obviously attracted to him ) is-is-is there a-a mrs. stevens ? y ’ know , it is so strange seeing ross here this time of day , ‘ because usually he is got the children ’ s hospital . and he is a great brother ! ohh ! no , you said the baby creeps you out . you said the baby . why would the little girl creep you out ? what ? ! excuse me ! how was your first day ? well y ’ know joey , you are a pretty charming guy . no sweetie , you have got to win over the guy that controls c.h.e.e.s.e. ! you have got to kiss some serious robot ass ! yeah ! that is why I am sleeping with him on the side . phoebe , stop writing about us ! okay fine ! fine ! then you know what , I will just write about phyllis ! hmm ! ( writing on a piece of paper ) phyllis is sitting in a chair . ( still writing ) phyllis sees what I am doing . chandler , we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six . we said six ! yeah and if i had seven , maybe i would have said something like this , `` wow ! my boyfriend ’ s such a wise ass—seven ! '' ugh ! what time ? inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book ! hey ! ( jumps over a box ) honey , that is a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor ! oh , so you can move them ! it is nice to meet you . janine ... ? joey , did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in ? uh-huh , what exactly did you ask her ? oh , so you like her too chandler ? wait a minute ... joey . joey you can not ask her out , she is your roommate . it-it will be way too complicated . yeah and you better watch the flirting too , because you know , in such close quarters , it could be trouble . ( chuckles ) hmm , well you are around me all the time and you do not flirt . did you also have his album , it is not easy being green ? so , phoebe runs weird huh ? why do not you just be straight with her ? tell her the truth . i do not know . rachel I am-I am sorry that i hurt your ankles . we will see . ( on phone ) hi ! terrible . if-if i want something done right , i have to do it myself . other people just wreck stuff . i really think i might kill someone tonight . it is worse . the only thing that is getting me through is knowing that I am going to be seeing you soon . i think i may even try to get out of here early . well , are you just hanging out with ross ? what ? ! why is ross naked ? naked ? is it the same thing that chandler had ? okay , listen , there is still some of chandler 's medicine under the sink in the bathroom . bye ! is it okay for me to come in now ? why is everything different ? well , the end table is wrong , the couch looks bizarre and do not even get me started on the refrigerator magnets . it is okay . chandler , are you afraid of me or something ? of course not . i mean gosh , chandler what you did , it is , it is a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it . i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place , but I would never expect you to worry about that . of course ! all right , hold on okay ? first thing 's first . ( gets her cleaning gloves on ) okay , now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked ? yes , hi . no leg-chewing for us sir . i can not think of anything we are doing . ( quietly ) why can not i think of anything we are doing ? okay , I will see you tomorrow ! ( doug exits . ) just so you know , we are not seeing him tomorrow . ( chandler wonders why . ) i-i can not spend another evening with that man . do you remember how he behaved at our wedding ? that is because he was not invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party . why did you do that ? oh yeah , the evander holyfield phase . oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me . hey , i could have had you if i wanted you . you and mona are doing a holiday card together ? like asking her to move in with you ? making her a mixed tape ? all right . have you said , `` i love you ? '' you could say , i love you . that is a slap in the face . hi roger . rachel umm , i was just talking to this guy and i think he will have sex with you . from the tequila factory ? come here . i can breath through my mouth . i promise . hey , speaking of together , how about we send out a holiday card this year ? you broke a little girl ’ s leg ? ! ! maybe a hello kitty doll , the ability to walk ... all right , I will take one box of the mint treasures , just one , and that is it . i-i started gaining weight after i joined the brown birds . ( to ross ) remember , how dad bought all my boxes and i ate them all ? no . do not , do not , do not , do not , do not do this . ( she reaches out for it and stops ) oh god ! i got to go !

( checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her . ) ( to the woman ) do not crowd me ! ( finds it ) this is it ! this is the dress ! oh my god , it is perfect ! ( she takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it . ) I am sorry , this one ’ s taken !

( to chandler ) see ? alright , I am going to go pick up a few things for the trip . ( pinching her ) let us get you out of here ! ! ( they go outside ) at least you took me down with you ! i guess , in time . i mean , my feelings for richard are certainly gone . wow ! that mike thing was interesting ! i do not know what is going to happen with phoebe and david . ok , I am sensing that this is some kind of word play , because you are pink with barely controlled glee . what ? ( looks very shocked ) why ? chandler , we have talked about this . you are not supposed to give people advice ! now could not you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ? they have only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike ! she will say `` no '' , david 's heart will be broken , it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again . ok ! when i go places with high humidity , it gets a little extra body , ok ? ! ( to chandler ) oh , honey , can you make sure we get a king size bed ! ( shouts to chandler ) and make sure our room is not next to theirs ( points to phoebe ) . yeah , right ! ok ! see what happens when you give people advice ? i hope you told him not to ? ok fine . I will handle this . ( goes to phoebe who is talking to rachel ) phoebe ? ( looking very serious ) i need to talk to you . what are you serious ? you want to marry him ? wha ... what about mike ? do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ? ok , mike , enough is enough , now you love phoebe and she loves you , so you need to get over your whole `` i never want to get married '' thing and step up ! this is monica ! I am phoebe 's friend . listen , phoebe is back with david and he is going to propose to her , and she is going to say `` yes '' but i know she really wants to be with you ! i ... I am sorry , did you say something ? i can not hear through all this damned hair ! ( tries to move her huge hair away from the phone , in vain ) you do not tell me what to do ! i tell you what to do ! just call her . she is at the paradise hotel in barbados . and while I have got you , you have got curly hair . what do you do in humidity ? ( mike hangs up the phone ) damnit ! ( sarcastically ) well , i hope you are happy ! phoebe is going to say `` yes '' to david . see , that is what happens when you meddle in people 's lives ! no it is not , b'because she is still in love with mike ! no , i called him . it is not going to happen . well , if you had not meddled to start with , i would not have had to go in there and meddle myself . now , no matter how much we meddle , we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place ! i can not believe she is going to say yes to david . she is clearly in love with mike . oh my god , he is going to do it now . please , i can not watch this , let us go . it is the humidity ! you are the most incredible woman I have ever met . how can i lose you ? ( phoebe looks very flattered ) now , i do not actually have a ring ... ( to everybody ) because of our meddling ! alright ? i know ( she snuggles to him ) the sun is out ! ok listen , you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs , and I will get the magazines and the lotion . damn it ! yeah !

( hesitatingly ) i punched you ... ? ... phoebe ... ? i clunked your heads together ! c'mon guys , it will be fun ! but then how do we know who wins ? so , we are just four losers ... super ! ( smiling ) ok ! sure ! got to ! aww ! hell , yeah ! how much were you thinking ? make it fifty ! ( nearly shouting ) one thousand ... ( going through her pockets ) no ... ( to chandler and phoebe ) either of you girls got a quarter ? heads ! no , tails ! he-he-heads ! ( angry ) ow , what are the chances ! ha ! my point ! ooh ! I am sorry ! i think , i think , that may have missed the table ! ah , yeah ! ah , yeaaah ! ah yeaaaah ! oh , damn it !

( chandler is still not getting it . ) chandler ! what is the matter with your face ? ! i mean this picture is supposed to say `` geller and bing to be married , '' not `` local woman saves drowning moron ! '' ( the photographer laughs . ) hey ! do not laugh at him ! he is my drowning moron ! that is it ! take it ! take it ! take it ! they can not all be bad . ( to chandler ) find the one where you make your bedroom eyes . ohh , there it is . do you really want to pull at that thread ?

( entering ) hey ! what is the big deal ? ross let me ask you a question . all jokes aside , where is this relationship going ? do you really see this as a long-term thing ? hi guys . oh , thank you ! ( the gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances . ) ( monica giggles . ) what is going on ? what are you doing ? are you okay ? yeah . I am okay . I am actually—I am a little cold , can i have your jacket ? ( laughs ) are you sure you are okay ? ohh that is sweet ! ( interrupting him ) oh my god ! oh my god , richard .

( to richard ) it is good to see you and so , we are hiding in the bathroom . so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know they are going at it right on the bathroom floor . ohh . i thought you were going out with elizabeth . oh ross , sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can not get out of ! why do not you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff . i mean that is what i did when i first ( looks at chandler and pauses ) weighing stuff . if the school finds out you are fired . she is leaving for three months . look ross , the only question you need to ask is , `` do you see a future ? '' i mean like do you see yourself marrying her ? ( ross pauses in consideration . ) oh my god ! you did it already ! you married her , did not you ? ! okay well i think…that is your answer . why do you want to see my hand ? ( suspiciously ) okay . ( exits to carry out phoebe ’ s wishes . ) ( entering ) i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes ! ( entering ) hi guys ! what are you up too ? well that is a little crazy . although i am y ’ know glad to hear that you are branching out on what you look at on the internet . why ? ! to celebrate your relationship ! to solidify your commitment ! to declare your love for one another to the world ! okay well that is good to know . sure , i love this part ! ( starts to look busy . ) richard ! ohh… oh , that is okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef . like i have nothing better to do ! so what is up ? oh , good to see you too . did you come down here to tell me that ? what uh—what did you—what ? ! y ’ know you are really not supposed to be back here ! oh god… ( starts looking around . ) why do not they put chairs back here ? ! what the… yes you are too late ! where was all this three years ago ? ! what were you doing in africa ? ohhh ! what are you doing to me ? ! oh look , i-i… I am sorry but umm , this-this-this-this is not going to happen . well he is ! yeah , i mean marriage is all he talks about ! my goodness , in fact , I am the one that is making him wait ! yeah ! why ? because of the government . so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday , you do not really believe that do you ? yeah , but that is pigs not people ! wait a minute . are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married ? oh my god ! then-then-then what are we even doing ? ! what is this ? ! y ’ know what ? ! i got to go ! ugh ! have you seen rachel ? or a mirror ? yeah , it is great . I am just having one of those days where you realize you are in a dead-end relationship ! it is not like i want to get married tomorrow ! it is just that i-I would like to believe that I am in a relationship that is actually going somewhere , that I am not just wasting my time ! no i do not know chandler ! not anymore ! it is like it is like something is changed . i did not change ! what ? ! is that some kind of boat talk ? what does he think ? does he think I am just going to wait around for nothing ? ( starts for the door ) well there is some people who do want to marry me . yeah ! richard ! that is right . you just told me that he hates marriage ! that-that he is a-a complex fellow who is unlikely to take a wife ! that-that he is against marriage and always will be ! hi . i do not know why I am here . i do not know . ( entering ) chandler is such an idiot ! yeah , I will have a scotch… ( moving over to the couch ) still smoking cigars ? no that is , that is okay . uh yeah , i-i actually i thought about you a couple months ago . yeah but it was because i-i had an eye exam and i do not like my new eye doctor . edward nevski ? no . but getting over was the hardest thing that I have ever had to do . and i never let myself think about you . ( to the mask ) i missed you-you ugly , flat faced old freak ! oh ! ( laughs and points at the mask . ) him . i missed this apartment ! now , this is a grown-up ’ s apartment ! y ’ know , i-i should be with a grown-up , do you know what i mean ? ! y ’ know , let us face it , I am not a kid anymore ! i-i need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that i do ! i mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me , i want that ! talking about pig sex over lunch , i do not want that ! fair ? please do not even talk to me about fair ! fair would have been you wanting to marry me back then ! or fair would have been chandler wanting to marry me now ! believe me , nothing about this is fair ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing ! nothing . ( she backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes . ) i do not kn—umm . i do not know . umm… y ’ know , i-i… i have to figure…some st—y ’ know , some stuff before i can… you wanted it to be a surprise . chandler… in all my life… i never thought i would be so lucky . ( starting to cry . ) as to…fall in love with my best…my best… there is a reason why girls do not do this ! yes . i knew you were likely to take a wife ! come in ! come in ! ( joey , rachel , and phoebe burst through the door . ) we are engaged ! ! ! oh… hey . ross , did you know mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving ? yes , they are . the blymens invited them . i am not wrong . no , i just talked to them . oh , wow , so you are going to be one of those `` healthy , healthy , healthy guys '' ? ok , I will tell you what . how about i cook dinner at my place ? I will make it just like mom 's . you know , they are not actually supposed to have ... ( ross looks at her sheepishly ) I will work on the lumps . joey , you are going home , right ? and i assume , chandler , you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays . phoebe , you are going to be with your grandma ? so you are free thursday , then . yeah . rach , are you thinking you are going to make it to vail ? hey , rach , did you make your money ? rach , here is your mail . ( insistently ) no , here is your mail . ( gives her an envelope ) would you just open it ? we all chipped in . ( to joey ) you owe me 20 bucks . ( hands chandler a bag ) chandler , here you go , got your traditional thanksgiving feast , you got your tomato soup , your grilled cheese fixin 's , and your family size bag of funyuns . mmm , looking good . ok , cider 's mulling , turkey 's turking , yams are yamming . ( notices ross is depressed ) what ? all right , that is it . you know what ? just get out of my way and stop moping . that is not a question . all right , fine . tonight 's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps , and in the form of tots . ah ! what , phoebe , did you whip the potatoes ? ross needs lumps ! why would we do that ? ok , three kinds of potatoes coming up . got the keys ? or got the keys ! ok , right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside , juicy on the inside . why are we standing here ? no i do not . no i did not . i asked , `` got the ke-eys ? '' ( panicked ) the oven is on . well then get it , get it ! ( angry ) joey ! can you go any faster with that ? why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway ? i swear you said you had the keys . why would i have the keys ? but i did not . why ? why ? why ? because everything is my responsibility ? is not it enough that I am making thanksgiving dinner for everyone ? you know , everyone wants a different kind of potatoes , so I am making different kinds of potatoes . does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want ? nooooo , no , no ! ( starting to cry ) just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions , and mario gets his tots , and it is my first thanksgiving , and it is all burned , and , and i ... i ... well , the turkey 's burnt . ( checking pots ) potatoes are ruined , potatoes are ruined , potatoes are ruined . no , it does not , does it ? but you wanted lumps , ross ? ( picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes ) well , here you go , buddy , ya got one . oh , really ? so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner ? stop it , stop it , stop it ! ooh , ugly naked dancing ! ( holding sandwich ) does anybody want to split this with me ? make a wish ? it sounds interesting ! yeah . no , i do not think it ever works . why ? no , no , rachel ? who do you want to fool around with ? ( whispering ) you can not ! in the hall . you want to fool around with joey ? who ? who do you know that are friends that just fool around ? who , who are they ? both of them ? which one ? rachel , things can get incredibly complicated . what the hell are you cooking ! hey ! what is so bad about that ?

( they high-five . ) excuse me ? why do not you go see dr. gettleman ? he did not die . i saw his daughter last week . said he was fine . her on the other hand , botched botox . oh , maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist . yeah , he used to have this recurring nightmare , just really freaked him out . that i was going to eat him . hey ! what are you doing ? that is so sweet . find anything ? nothing , huh ? 'slim pickings ' ... that is so cheesy . honey , that is okay . i actually know this woman , nancy , who is a restaurant biz head-hunter . maybe she will know of something .

I am going to miss this hand ! okay i know it is a lot to ask , but oh my god chandler , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity . well , if you really think about it , i mean four days is not that long . i mean , i see you monday before you go to work , and i see you thursday when you get back , and i always work late on tuesdays , so really if you think about it , it is really just one day . and well , if we can not make it one day , we have got real problems my friend . really ? that is the nicest anyone has ever said to me ! how was the pediatrician ? are you serious ? you still see dr. gettleman ? where have you been ? promise to call me when you land . i love you too .

( really excited ) mmh ... this cake is amazing ! i would get a room with this cake . i think i could show this cake a good time ! ( with no hesitation ) sex ! oh , I am sorry honey , you know , but when she said `` sex '' i was not thinking about `` sex with you '' ! hey ! you smell like perfume and cigarettes . nancy does not smoke ! so ? what do you think of the house ? is not it ? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic ? do not you love the huge yard ? and nancy said that it is really under price , because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents ! so ? do you think we should get it ? i think we should . this is huge ! how bad you want to smoke , right now . gotcha . when do we tell them about this ? okay . right . oh my god that is going to be so hard . if only there were a smaller one to clean this one ! no , he is picking up dinner , why , what is up ? what ? oh my god ! oh my god that is awful ! what did you think of the house ? yeah , sure ... uhm , I am devastated , obviously ... ( to the rest ) did you think the neighborhood was homey ? ( chandler enters ) ( goes to chandler ) phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and ... them ... they think you are having an affair . ( turns to them ) ok , alright , you guys , you would better sit down , this is pretty big . uhm , she has been showing us houses outside of the city . when we found out that we are going to get this baby , chandler and i started talking and we decided that we did not want to raise a kid in the city . and that is great for you guys , but we want a lawn and a swingset ... and about an hour ago , we made an offer . ( smiling ) it is so sweet . it really is . it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there is these old maple trees ... ( gets cut off ) we think if you saw it , you would understand . i mean you guys were there . ( points to rachel and phoebe ) it is beautiful , is not it ? well , i guess we have established who is staying here with monica ... okay , rachel , you want to put the marshmallows in concentric circles . every year . hey , did you get the turkey bast-oh my god ! oh my god !

( she opens the door . ) hey ross . what is up bro ? I am so sorry that you had to find out this way . I am sorry , but iit-t 's true , i love him too . well , this is the last box of your clothes . I am just going to label it , `` what were you thinking ? '' whoa-whoa-whoa , phoebe you got to take her ! y ’ know , i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her , but y ’ know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate . she gets tons of catalogs and umm , she will fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I would like . when i take a shower , she leaves me little notes on the mirror . when i fall asleep on the couch after reading , she covers me over with a blanket . and when i told her that i was going to be moving in with chandler , she was really supportive . ( to rachel ) ( starts to cry ) you were so great . you made it so easy . and now you have to leave . and i have to live with a boy ! ! ( they both break down in tears . ) she really left . thank you . can i ask you a question ? what the hell is that dog doing here ? ! ( she notices the dog sitting in the living room . ) and ? we can not afford that . well , there you go . yeah , we will be okay . i know there will be other houses , but it is just so ... i love that one so much . what ? oh my god ! oh my god ! my god ! we have got the house ! ? and a baby ... we sure are .

( they grab a hold of each other 's necks . ) wrestle ! ( they start wrestling . ) that was unbelievable ! hi , how are you doing kelly ? it is my new perfume . why do not you come closer where you can really appreciate it ? this is disgusting ! having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about . it is about being with the people that you love . oh , here . aw , I am sorry sweetie that she does not feel the same way . hold it ! are you talking about dick clark ’ s new year ’ s rocking eve ? oh my god ! we love that show ! i mean ross and i have been watching it since i can remember ! we are there ! what are you talking about ? she just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium ! we are going to dick clark ’ s new year ’ s rocking eve ! oh my god ! okay , here comes another camera . if we want to get on camera , i think we have to get up on one of those platforms . they have been taping those people up there all day . oh yeah ? well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants ? hey , see that snippy guy over there ? he is the one who decides who gets up on the platform . we should go dance by him . excuse me , sir , would it help if i were not wearing underpants ? man , this sucks ! y ’ know if mom and dad do not see us on tv after we made them so jealous , i mean , who is going to be the losers then ? what ? ross , we have not done the routine since middle school . was it really that good ? okay , let us do it . mom and dad are going to be so faced ! 5 6 7 8 ! yes !

( to ross ) hey , by the way , great thinking about catching me ! what ? we could do it ! i can do it , okay ? come on , let us go . ( she and ross get up ) i can not do it !

( the phone rings and monica answers it . ) uh , rach , it is the visa card people . ( on phone ) could you please tell me what this is in reference to ? ( listens ) yes , hold on .

( pauses then on the phone ) uh- rachel has left the building , can you call back ? you should feel great about yourself ! you are doing this amazing independence thing ! ah , the other jack . so what , you are not the only one . i mean , half the time we do not know where we are going . you have just got to figure at some point it is all going to come together , and it is just going to be ... un-floopy . ... pheebs ? no , you were right . i do not have a plan . ( there is a knock on the door . ) phoebe ? do you have a plan ? ( leaping off of the couch and runs up ) wait ! did you say ' g.stephanopoulos ?

( chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her . ) yeah , but i do not think we have time . ( lustily ) let us do it ! ( she kisses him and they fall back onto the bed . ) ( chasing after him ) chandler ! it happens to lots of guys ! you-you-you were probably tired , you had a lot of champagne , do not worry about it ! phoebe ! phoebe ! come on ! let us go ! ( knocks on her door . ) come on ! ( phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go . ) why are not you dressed yet ? ! ( grabs the guitar away from her ) no , phoebe , I will tell you what , if you get ready now I will let you play it at the wedding . fair enough , now go get ready ! I will get everybody else ( does so ) , finally we can start celebrating my— ( she gasps and is stopped by the sight of ross and rachel making out in the hall . ) I am sorry , uh apparently I have opened the door to the past . ( interrupting ) can i ask you just a little question , huh ? why tonight ? see , I have been waiting my whole life to be engaged , and unlike some people I am only planning on doing this once . so , uh y ’ know , maybe this is selfish and I am sorry about it , but i was kind of hoping tonight could just be about that . no it is not ! no ! no ! now it is about you and ross getting back together ! see yeah umm , you kind of stole my thunder ! that is true . thunder being stolen ! ! well , we are still talking about it , are not we ? yes that would be lovely . y ’ know what ? i-i think that umm , i do not feel like going to the plaza . no-no , i-i really do not want to talk about it ! i do not ! ( to rachel ) especially with you . ( goes into her room . ) i can not believe her , y ’ know it is just—it is so typical . paris ? keep talking . i love you ! ( in a french accent ) bonjour , monsieur . ( opening the door ) hi pheebs , what is up ? ( she enters . ) what ? ! yes . well , let us just say it is not the first time you have stolen my thunder . my sweet sixteen ! remember , you went to third base with my cousin charlie . it is all everybody at the party could talk about ! ( gasps ) we had a characturist ! and yet , here we are doing it again . oh please ! why else would you have made out with ross ? ! i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night ! oh , is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes ? ! i do not know ! i do not—maybe you are feeling a little resentful . maybe ah , maybe you thought you would get married first ! maybe you can not stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you ! ( yelling after them ) i can not believe you are going to have sex on my engagement night ! ! ( outside the door ) it is monica , open up ! i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together , but i must warn you , the night that you announce your engagement I am going to announce that I am pregnant ! i know why ! okay ! why ? ! what do you mean ? ( starting to cry ) I am sorry i almost made you sleep with ross . ( they hug . ) hey you guys ? i know it is last minute , but we decided to have a halloween party . and everybody has to wear costumes . ( and there is general disconcertment . ) come on ! it will be fun ! you have to ! so ross , are you going to bring mona ? wait ! you are supposed to wear a costume ! oh . I am catwoman , who wants to borrow the dress when you are too big for it . so we do supergirl . what ? ! i thought he would love it ! his favorite kid 's book was the velveteen rabbit ! well , it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all . you did not dress up either ? ! what ? ! there is only been like four kids . what are you supposed to be ? no , space doody ! hey joey ? you read comic books right ? who do you think would win in a fight , catwoman or supergirl ? yeah… what ? ! really ? ! no you are fine . ( joey checks anyway . ) all right well , do you think i could take rachel ? what ? ! come on i am tough ! punch me right here ! ( her stomach ) as hard as you can ! oh really ? okay ? well what would you say if i told you that , y ’ know , ross or chandler could beat you up ? oh my god , phoebe ! you are getting a crush on your sister ’ s fianc�e . i can not answer that ! chandler ’ s my husband . yeah . ross is really strong ! okay , he is the strongest out of all three of you ! ( joey looks at her . ) except for joey . wait-wait ! ! okay , stop it ! stop it ! stop ! ( breaks it up . ) now listen , no one ’ s going to fight in this apartment . ( to chandler ) look honey , you do not have to do this , okay ? it is the strength you have inside that means the most to me . you are loyal , you are honest , and you have integrity ! that is the kind of strength that i want in the man that i love ! ( to phoebe ) oh god ! chandler ’ s making his sex face . look , i wanted to tell I am-I am sorry you lost . ( laughs ) is that a secret or a lie . chandler please ! let us go big bunny ! ( to rachel ) wow ! it is really red ! you should go see my eye doctor . since we have been going out , i think I have mentioned his name twice ! it is not richard ! okay ? it is this new guy and he is really good . hey rach , remember that great song , me , myself , and i ? ( and on the `` i '' part she mimics poking her eye . ) bye ! why are so mad at him ? well , it just seems that… chandler ! you do not have to ask for my permission . ( quietly ) you can go . hey rach , come on ! we are going to be late for the eye doctor appointment ! no . if you thought this mess is going to bother me , you are wrong ! all right , let us go blinky ! ( she ushers rachel out the door , but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in . ) chandler ! ! ! ! ( chandler agrees to clean up the mess . ) ( looks at it more closely ) oh that is an eye removal machine . I am kidding ! I am kidding ! a small puff of air , now come on ! y'know what , I am going to hold her head . okay . ( monica backs off . ) dr. miller ? ( she covers her right eye and reads from the chart ) p e c f d. i sure do ! ( she runs over to a drawer , opens it , and grabs a lollipop . ) ( to rachel ) and you do not get one ! they are still in my coat . i love you . i want to say good-bye at the car ! oh , i know ! umm , is it because he is always correcting people 's grammar ? whom ! whom ! sometimes it is who ! chandler ! what are you doing here ? not even close . okay ! all right ! let us do it ! sit down . ( they sit down on the couch . ) put your head back . all right . now , open your eyes . how many fingers am i holding up ? ( she is not holding any up . ) oh my god , i was thinking four . yes ! all right , y'know what ? why do not we start with a practice run ? okay ? no drops ! okay . on three , 1…2…3 ! ( rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops . ) now my pillow 's all wet ! ( she was trying to fool rachel and squeezed the eyedropper . ) then why did you move ? ! all right , come here ! ( she gets up and drags rachel off of the couch by her legs . ) i am going… I am going -- turn it over ! ( rachel rolled onto her stomach and monica rolls her back . ) I am… i am going to get these drops in your eyes . ( she is holding rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth . ) ( spitting out the eyedropper ) damn ! it is empty ! ( answers the phone ) hello ? ( listens . ) ( to phoebe ) it is joey . ( phoebe 's proud of herself . ) ( to joey ) I am so glad you called ! chandler told me what happened . y'know he is really upset about it . what did you do to his sweater vests ? yeah , she is here . hold on a second . ( she hands the phone to phoebe . ) well , maybe you should send him something . so that when he gets to las vegas he will know that you are sorry . ( answering it ) hello ? hey joey ! aww , you remembered even though you are a big star ! joey , what is it like on a movie set , huh ? do you have a dressing room ? do you have a chair with your name on it ? go ! ! okay ! okay ! okay ! ( she succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of rachel . ) we will see you in about 3 to 4 hours . probably the only time I will ever say this , but did you see the ass on her ? ( entering from her bedroom , talking on the phone ) yeah , once again , i am sorry . thank you . bye . ( to the gang ) i just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people . sixty guests . because i do not have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice . i mean there is no way . i do not know . really ? because I would need like $ 500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff . well , you are not working either . yeah , that would be great ! thank you ! hey ! oh my god , it was the best funeral ever ! i mean , everyone loved the food , and guess what ? i even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today 's best friend . i mean , it is like i am the official caterer for that accident ! thanks . like , check out my new catering stuff . ( picks up two frying pans ) look at this ! I am an omelet station ! omelet ? made to order ! oh . well , i did not realize that you needed it back right away . i mean , you told me to go and be a caterer . so i went . i beed . i mean , i ... i used it to buy all this stuff . but look—I have got another job tomorrow , so I will pay you back with the money i make from that . okay . oh , is everything in the car ? no . i hate this part . no , that is not mine . excuse me , mrs. burkart ? well , we are all cleaned up in the kitchen . um , and , well there is the .. the the small matter of ... just the matter of ... payment ? oh , phoebe , she could not stop crying ! with those thick glasses , her tears looked giant . what ? okay . so what do you .... you think she is faking ? phoebe , she sounded pretty upset to me . maybe i can try at intermission ? phoebe , come on ... you know what ? let us just go ! I am going to leave some cards here . please think of us for you next event . oh , that is great ! congratulations ! oh , it was great ! the widow would not pay , so phoebe yelled at her 'til she did . and I am a wuss . and we should be partners . wait a minute , phoebe ! we should be partners . we should be catering partners . i mean , think about it ! you are not working right now , and we have such a great time together ! i can cook and you can take care of the money . hi . uh , you ... you do not know me , I am monica geller ... ross 's sister . yeah . anyway , he told me about your apartment . and , um , i could not sleep , thinking about it . so , uh , would it be okay if i cleaned it ? no ? ( looking out of the window ) oh my god . you guys ! you got to come see this ! there is some creep out there with a telescope ! so have you called her yet ? i can not believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people . look look ! it is rachel and barry . no , do not everybody look at once ! how did it go ? rachel , what is going on ? i mean is not this the same barry who you left at the altar ? okay , how about the fact that he is engaged to another woman , who just happens to be your ex-best friend ? that is what you have been working on for the past two hours ? ! ( looking out the window ) look look ! he is doing it again , the guy with the telescope ! great , now he is waving back . what kind of stuff ? yeah .. uh , but for future reference , that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone . y'see , this is where you would use that 'hello ' word we talked about . ( wandering in after her ) uh , rach ... how come you have dental floss in your hair ? uh huh . you had sex in his chair ? ! ... i said that a little too loudly , did not i ? brrrrrrr ! relax . y'know , she may not even know . why do not you just take it with you ? why do not you just call her ? do you ? do not you have to pee ? just like you told her you did ! ( chandler glares at her . ) ... just pointing out the irony . so she is a woman ! so what ? joey ! ! the green dress ? really ? ( waves dismissively to sidney ) nooo ! you okay ? really ? aww ... ( they hug ) yeah , there you go ! what was it for ? wow ! yeah . but a part of me also can not wait ‘ til it is over . chandler and i have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding . hey phoebe , will you give me a hand ? i got to make up the guest bedroom . ( to ross ) hey , cousin cassie is coming to stay with us a few days . uh-hmm . ross , she is 25 years old . hey ! subtle guys ! i know you are planning my surprise bridal shower . okay . sorry . ( she goes into the guest bedroom . ) hey ! what did you decide to do about the movie ? that is what you say about porn . no ! no you should ! a lot of major actors do nude scenes ! i mean the chance to star in a movie ? come on ! plus , everyone is going to see your thing . ( giggles . ) hey ! oh boy me too ! yeah ? the wedding is off , sloppy and immature ! okay . ( they both jump up to head for there room , but monica stops . ) but wait , we can not . my cousin cassie is in the guest room , we are supposed to have lunch . shrill ? ! the wedding is back on ! so , are you ready to go ? ( catching him ) chandler ! ( to ross ) cassie needs to stay at your place . because purvry perverson over here can not stop staring at her . you were staring about eight inches south of there . she looks exactly like aunt marilyn . wafer thin ice ! so to get this part you can not be ? but you are ? but you told them you were not ? wow ! wow ! and it is definitely all gone ? there is nothing there to work with ? ( joey glares at her . ) what were you thinking ? joey ! this is not like learning to ride a horse ! this is like learning to…grow a turtleneck ! oh my god , what are you going to do ? ! unless ! well , this may sound crazy , but there maybe something we could fashion . well I am not sure yet , but umm of the top of my head I am thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat . ( entering ) hey ! well uh , I am trying to make something for joey . do you mind if i raid your fridge ? okay . ( opens the fridge . ) all right , turkey . eh , that will not work . cheese ? ( picks it up ) that will not work . olive loaf ? ( picks it up ) i hope that will not work . no it is umm , more like a wrap . okay so uh , I am going to go guys . i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present ! ( runs out . ) okay , we have a lot of options here , a number of prototypes for you to try on . yeah ! okay , this one is a mushroom cap . ( points to it . ) umm , this one is made of bologna . ( points . ) oh , just until the glue dries . ( to a whole group ) now , these are-are more realistic , but perishable . okay ? ( to a different group ) over here we have pink suede , which is nice . but umm , if it gets wet then you know it is going to shrink . i also , did a little something in fur . but umm , that is really just for me . ( rubs it against her cheek . ) okay . so , why do not you go into your room and try these on and we will see—get a better idea of what is going to work . toothpick ? what are you trying on now ? and ? joey ! what ? ! which one ? ! phoebe ! rachel ! it is monica ! i wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice ! ( she bursts into the apartment to find only phoebe and rachel sitting on the couch . ) oh . for what ? you al-you already had it ? well no wait a minute that is not true ! no , what did , that was really sweet . and it kind of works out for the best . well now , i get to spend my shower with the only people i really love ! i mean , i get all those presents ( motions to the pile in the corner ) without having to talk to people i do not even like ! perhaps , you would like me to turn like this , ( turns sideways on the couch ) so that you can bunny bump against my back . see , now this is why i keep notepads everywhere . oh , now you want a pad . ( entering from her bedroom ) i got to go to work . has anybody seen my left boob ? there it is . joey , what are you doing ? what is it with you people ! i mean , the minute you start to feel something , you have to run away ? oh , you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you . that is never good . welcome to our side of the tunnel . you know , when you start get screwed over all the time , you got to switch to low-fat . well , no , not at all , you are not terminal , you just , you just need some damage control . she has to know that your not ready . my god ! chandler , we said be 'aloof ' not ' a doof ' . you know what , everything 's going to be okay . if-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call . oh wait , you know what , i got it , i got it , pretend like you just woke up , okay , that will throw her off . be sleepy . aw , it is soo unfair . ( they both start digging into the 'good ' ice cream ) what are you being such a weenie for ? so he has a barbi , big deal . you used to dress up like a woman . well , you used to dress up in mom 's clothes all the time . the big hat , the pearls , the little pick handbag . how can you not remember ? you made us call you ... bea . was not there a little song ? ( singing ) ' i am bea . ' ' i drink tea . ' ' .... will not you , will not you , will not you .... ' a-ha ! ! ! ( they all start laughing , as ross hides in the bathroom ) ( she enters with a headset on and she is speaking into the microphone ) well , it matters to me ! did you just hung up on me ? ( she hangs up too ) all right , look , i need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours . you do not know military time ? just subtract twelve . ( screaming ) six of the clock ! ok. hold on . ( her mobile phone rings ) geller here ! no ! i said it has to be there by 4 of the clock . goodbye . ( she hangs up ) oh , how hard it is to make an ice sculpture ? please ... honey , leave the details to me . now i want to make this day as special for you as i can . now , ok , i was thinking that the harpist should wear white . ooh ... she backed out . i made her . ( phoebe looks shocked ) steel drums do not really say `` elegant wedding '' . nor does marjorie 's overwhelming scent . ( coming ) are you still crying about your damn baby ? pheebs , you got to keep the line moving , remember , 20 seconds per person . your see these clowns all the time ! ( she takes off ) ( looking at phoebe eating something ) pheebs , spit that out , that has pork in it . yeah , i changed them . i-i sent you a fax about it ! ah , well then there are going to be a few surprises ! ok , it is 2100 hours . ( to phoebe ) time for your toast . ( mike appears ) you had a bathroom break at 2030. pee on your own time , mike ! ( to phoebe and mike ) . now , in regard to the toast , okay , you want to keep them short , nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches . okay . you just get in , do your thing and get out ! ( very serious ) it is 2101 and i am not amused . ( pause ) . ok , the bride and groom have a few words they would like to say . ( everyone sits and phoebe gets up ) what ? hi . about last night ... i know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit ... my point is , uh , well , I am willing to take my job back . oh , is that so ? ok. if that is really what you want , then here ... i give you the headset . well , i do not really want to give you the headset . well i guess if you are taking over , you should probably return these messages . ( hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return ) uh-huh , but I am sure you can handle this . i mean , i have won awards for my organizational skills , but , uh , I am sure you will do fine . mm-mh . i printed them out on my computer . hi . she is in her room , why ? i know . bye . ( obviously enjoying this setback ) ugh , i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address . ( by now she can barely keep herself from smiling ) uh ! what a pickle . ( enjoying what she is seeing ) how is it going ? what ? ( sounds moved ) really ? you really want me to come back ? ok people , we are back in business ! ( gets her headset out of her purse ) oh god , we have missed you soo much ! ( takes all the notes from phoebe ) ok , go and get your hair and make-up done , and I will take care of everything . ooh ! but the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from new jersey ! ( putting down her phone ) well , the club lost it is power . ( thinking ) affirmative ! ( walking around with her headset still on ) ok let us get these chairs out here ! gunther , hit the christmas lights . ( he does so and the lights above the chairs light up . monica looks satisfied ) okay , who left the ice sculpture ( picks up a piece of ice from the ground ) on the steam grate ? ( nobody answers ) level 1 alert . i repeat , level 1. this is not a drill . okay we have got a situation . the minister just called . he is snowed in . he can not make it . really ? okay , if joey does the ceremony , then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle . okay , mike and joey , get in position . chandler , come with me . ( they walk off , ross looks down to chappy , who he is holding and he gets a whiff of the dog 's smell . he is clearly disgusted by it . ) okay , joey 's doing the ceremony and chandler 's giving you away . so , you are ready to do this ? i love you . ( phoebe leans in to kiss her . ) oh , wait , wait , wait ! no hugs . the dresses ... oh what the hell . ( the girls hug ) okay . ( in her microphone ) it is zero hour . all teams execute on my count . ( to all ) let us get this bad boy on the road . ( checking her clipboard ) i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours . okay marjorie , hit it . groomsman , groomsman , why are you just standing there , where is your bridesmaid ? ( into microphone ) we have got a broken arrow . bridesmaid down ! ( realizes ) oh , that is me . boy , you are really not a morning person . what kind of changes ? oh , good luck . that is sooo not true ! i just—i can not believe that you think that you and chandler know me and rachel better than we know you . yeah . deal ! ha-ha ! aww , man ! that does not mean you know us better , i-i want a rematch . yeah ! and the winner gets a hundred bucks . are you scared ? ross will do it . you guys ! do you realize that any minute now , phoebe can be pregnant ? same category ? michael flatley , lord of the dance ! no ! ! i knew that ! rachel ! use you are head ! viva las gaygas ! you guys are dead , i am so good at lighting rounds . huh , want to bet ? how about we play for more money , say 150 ? you are doing it again . we will not . ( to chandler ) 300 ? I am just trying to spice it up ! i got it ! how about , if we win , they have to get rid of the rooster ? deal ! rachel , i have not missed one question the whole game . i own this game ! look at my hand . ( holds up her hand . ) no ! steady as a rock ! now , are you with me . come on ! come on ! sandwiches ! maurice . and processing . it is umm , it has something to do with transponding . that is not even a word ! i can get this ! i can get this ! nooooooooo ! ! ! ! ! man , i feel like I am coming down with something . yeah . ( to chandler ) i bet you can not guess what color my tonsils are ? I will bet the apartment ! how do you feel ? really ? ! how much ? ! look rach , we have to move . i mean if they had lost , we would have made them get rid of the birds . right ? all right , look , i hate this as much as you , but if it makes you feel better , it is all your fault . chinadolor bong , come on , we steal that tv guide every week ! well ? it is only been a couple of hours , so just give it some time . hey , rach , can you give me a hand with this box ? I will take care of it . i lost our mattresses . hey ! hey , do not mix those up , you could really ruin that lollipop . hey , we would still be living here if had not gotten the question wrong ! i can not find garbage bags ! what is it ? ! i can not believe we are living here ! okay , the reason why i asked you guys out to brunch today is because i have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor . first of all um , i love you both so much and you are both so important to me… well umm , i was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other . like hypothetically , if phoebe were mine… if phoebe were my maid of honor… rachel would be phoebe ’ s , i would be rachel ’ s , that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset . ( laughs ) well that is the best part . umm , you guys get to decide ! because then i do not have to ! I am really not deciding ! yeah that is right . yeah hey , a weird thing happened today whey i was at brunch . this woman overheard that i was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck . no , it is more like a ( sarcastically ) good luck . she was like 30 , dark hair , attractive . come on , was it somebody maybe you dated in college ? what are you doing ? oh my god yes ! who is she ? did you break up with her ? why ? fat ? ! you broke up with a girl because she was fat ? ! well , apparently she does . chandler ! ( knocks on the door . ) chandler ! i just figured out who you are ! you are lewis posin . lewis posin ! he was my best friend in fifth grade , and-and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no . do you know why ? no ! but because he thought i was to faaaaa… . ( chandler emerges , without flushing by the way . ) and every time i think about it , it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade ! y ’ know , i-i really think that you should apologize to julie . no , i know . but y ’ know what ? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me . it is pretty clear . why do not you just stop doing stupid things ? then you would not have to apologize . all right , i…i have to ask . are you going to break up with me if i get fat again ? well , you broke up with julie grath ! how much weight could she have gained ? in one year ? ! my god what did she eat ? her-her family ! that is not the point . well… that is not the only time this was an issue . you remember when umm , you spent thanksgiving with us ? you called me fat . how ? what if i have babies , okay ? i mean I am going to look different . I am okay with that , but I am not sure that you are ! keep going . even if i shrink down to two inches tall ? i love you . ( they hug and kiss . ) ( entering ) hey , what is going on ?

( they all leave and close the door on monica . ) ohhh ! ( throws her notepad down in disgust . ) ( entering from her room ) hey !

( on phone ) what is up ? oh , put him on ! `` hi I am rachel , is my sweater too tight ? no ? oh , I would better wash it and shrink it !

'' I am not talking to her ! well , maybe you are right—she made fun of my phone pen ! listen rachel , i feel really bad about—what are you doing ? ( she sees that rachel is unpacking . ) what ? ! it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left ! because it is my apartment ! how about , you are moving ! ! ( grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box . what follows is a brief sequence of rachel unpacking and monica packing the same stuff over and over again as rachel chants `` no . '' and monica chants `` yes . '' ) ( entering ) i am not ! no phoebe i am mad ! well , this is the last box of your clothes . I am just going to label it , `` what were you thinking ? '' whoa-whoa-whoa , phoebe you got to take her ! y ’ know i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her , but y ’ know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate . y ’ know she has 147,000 pairs of boots… she let us you borrow them . do you want to live outside ? ! because it is gettin ’ cold ! ( to phoebe ) she gets tons of catalogs and umm , she will fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I would like . when i take a shower , she leaves me little notes on the mirror . when i fall asleep on the couch after reading , she covers me over with a blanket . and when i told her that i was going to be moving in with chandler , she was really supportive . ( to rachel ) ( starts to cry ) you were so great . you made it so easy . and now you have to leave . and i have to live with a boy ! ! ( they both break down in tears . ) kind of . ( she hugs phoebe and looks out the window . she moves closer to it to get a better look . ) oh my god ! hey . call me when you get there . okay ? I am really going to miss you . thanks . yeah . bye . she really left . thank you . can i ask you a question ? what the hell is that dog doing here ? !

I am on it ! i think i hear curtains closing ... bedsprings , unmistakable ! not until you said it . somebody switch ! ( chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and phoebe runs to the other wall . monica returns to chandlers wall . ) wait a minute ... ross and charlie , joey and rachel , phoebe and mike ! we are the only people leaving with the same person we came with . okay , I have had it with the hair jokes . tomorrow morning , before we leave , I am going to the salon . honey , if you know it through a wall , you know it too well ! ( also hugs the wall ) yeah , we had a great time , thank you ! ( walks to phoebe ) other wall , people ! other wall ! yeah , but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her . and as his friend , i mean , do not you think he deserves the same from you ? check it out ! what do you think ? do not you just love it ? and listen to this ... ( shakes her body so the shells tingle ) oh , i can not wait for everyone at work to see these ... ( plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again ) ow ! yeah ! well , if i had them taken out , then i would not be able to do this . ( she pushes chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against chandler 's chest ) you like that , right ? ( again , she brushes her hair against his chest and hums ... ) it is `` bolero '' from `` 10 '' . you what ? you said you liked them . fine , so you do not like them . everybody else does . you know what ? i do not care . i like it like this , and I am going to keep it . you are just jealous because your hair can not do this ... ( and she shakes her head more violently ) ouch ! and the eye ! not really . i have a problem . well , i was dancing around , and singing `` no woman , no cry '' and i got stuck . oh , well , i can move ... ( she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail , opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes ) ( looking disappointed ) i guess so ... yeah , i tried to gnaw myself free . look what i found in the drawer ... ( chandler looks up from his book . ) and you said I would never wear this ... sure , what do you have in mind ? really ? i do not really feel like it . okay , i just do not get why you like it so much . mail call , rachel green , bunk seven . oh good ! because where else would we get any ? what is it ? barry who you almost ... ? and mindy , your maid of ... ?

( phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame . monica 's frightened and she gasps . ) oh ! what a tragic loss !
