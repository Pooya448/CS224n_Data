oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (he starts laughing, causing everyone else to laugh.)
hey rach! (she breaks up and goes back into monica’s.)
what the fu—(beep)—ck are you doing?!
what are you guys doing?
you see, i do not say—(starts laughing.)
(noticing the woman on the screen) whoa! she is purty!
shut up! shut up! shut up!!
monica’s got to have the phone in the right place and—(frantic babbling.)
(sporting a goatee) hey.
oh, so that is why the priest threw holy water on me. (there is no reaction from joey) okay, listen, you have to cheer up! okay? you should come out with ross and me, i mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about kate.
hey.
no way!
oh my god! who is going to watch that?!
yeah. (they start to leave)
thanks. (he takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
so um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
okay, so i guess that is about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
hey!
okay. (he opens it and it is a baby chick) it is a chicken.
fowl? no. women? nooo.
easy lenny.
okay, but this is the last time. (singing) with a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(joey enters)-chickeeeen.
hey.
she?
i do not know. (he picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) i can not tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
excuse me?
i stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
you do not think i get up when you get up?
yes, here it comes! I am stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? well i do not think so mister!
and you do not think taking care of our chick is work?
i know what you meant!! (pause) you notice that ever since we got this chick, we have been fighting a lot more than we used too?
I will take her back tomorrow.
hey!
(rushing in) oh, good! good! do you guys know how to get a chick out of a vcr?!
i know. see, yes. that is yasmine bleeth, she is a completely different kind of chick. i love you both. but in very different ways.
hey!
i did! but the store would not take her back! so then i took her to the shelter, and you know what i found out?
if they can not find a home for her, they kill her! and I am not going to let that happen to little yasmine!
okay. and it is not just chicks y'know? it is all kinds of other animals!
thanks, I am glad you see it that way.
ohhh-hoo, funny story!
okay! now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
that is a bad duck!!! (to ross) how did the thing go tonight, ross?
(to the duck) okay, now when you come back i hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy! (he goes back into the apartment)
(coming out of his apartment and seeing ross) what did you do?
having a swim.
chicks do not swim.
i do not know. should we try it?
see, i told you they do not swim. (he goes to take it out)
noo! (takes him out) oh, it is okay, it is okay, baby, baby, baby.
new haircut? (monica nods ‘no.’) necklace? (no) dress? (no) boots? (monica nods ‘yes.’) boots!
oh my god!
I am going to miss being able to afford food.
she had a point. (shows her the receipt.)
yeah well, too bad we are going to have to return them.
i have you.
hey-hey.
you can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
(returning to his seat) hey!
(spinning around looking for him) i do not think you did a very thorough job!
(opening the door) what is wrong?
oh do not forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (they go into the apartment.)
now sweetie, i know you do not like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. see? every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
why not?
do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company?
you said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
okay.
y’know, that party was not bad.
i do not see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk?
what honey, it is like fifteen blocks to the subway. let us go.
what is going on?
what?
so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right. (pause) it is oddly unsettling.
hop on.
honey, i know you are in pain right now, but I am a little turned on.
okay, ten blocks down. five to go.
oh I am sorry! do you need a break?
i can see it from right here. it will cost you one husband.
(pause) i do not have your boots.
well, why do not you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay!
honey, are you seriously ever going to wear the boots again?
y’know what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones.
okay. (moves closer to the window.)
hey, you guys!
so, what do you think?
are you kidding? okay, I will give you a hint; I will give you a hint. (points to his glasses.)
i got glasses!
no i did not!
no!
really?
(sitting down on the arm of her chair) you did not think i used to wear glasses, right?
that is okay pheebs, we are not having a party or anything, so you do not have to get us…
what we want honey.
dying people say the craziest things.
our kids are going to be fat are not they.
hey! how is the boat?!
well, it is good that you finally have a place to do that.
do you know what i was thinkin’?
nothing, i just like to go like this. (does it again.)
uh why, do you have a lecture?
then free as a bird. what is up?
well, did-did you correct him?
oh no problem, maybe I will play with my left hand.
does anybody know me?!
do not worry about it pheebs.
an old cookie?
we can not accept this.
‘because it is gross.
okay, we owe you a present.
i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. he even said i could call him dad.
daddy. all right look, here is the story. (flashback to chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were going to take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (the flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. he takes off his glasses.) so i take off my glasses and that is when in happened.
guys?
i know.
why do they put so much steam in there?!
why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
not that big a deal? there…there was touching of things.
i do not want him to tell this story for years.
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
(getting up) all right, I am off to see your dad.
look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to face—and by face i do not mean his lap. and by face, i do not mean my ass. (exits.)
so you understand, I would feel a lot more comfortable if you did not tell people what happened. y’know, I am a little…I am a little embarrassed about it.
what did you do when they found out?
so i guess we wear swimsuits in here!
hey! babe! are not you excited we are going on our honeymoon?
(singing) bermuda, bahama, come on pretty mama…
I would better go pack.
a speedo? uh, i do not have a speedo. I am going to go pack my regular long bathing suit. (goes into the bedroom.)
(entering) hey, what was that all about?
(in a high pitched voice) what?! i did not even know that—why did not you tell me?! (pause) why am i talking like this?!
(in the high pitched voice) what?! (normal voice) i am an excellent secret keeper. i have kept all of our secrets.
oh no-no joey, i am not going to tell you because i am an excellent secret keeper.
you already know.
oh honey, leave them alone, they are in love.
we are on our honeymoon.
25j and k, any chance those are not together?
no.
just act like you belong.
shh! (to the guy behind the counter) nice to see you again. (they tries to walk past him.)
yes, of course. (shows him the tickets.)
oh that is all right, i have it memorized. it is 1a.
apology accepted. excuse us. (they try to enter again.)
oh you have got to be kidding me.
we are you just ten seconds later!
(looks at monica then at them) we need the stuff.
what else is new?
buh-bye. (hangs up the phone) i just got us reservations at michelle’s and tickets to the musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
…betrothed couple.
hey!
pheebs?
skull?
how long have we been home?
lovely!
hey, you know what i was thinking? when we get married, are you going to change your last name to bing?
why not?
hey!
ohh! you guys going to be living together again?
well, she is just so much fun with joey, i just assumed, she would still be living with him.
no reason, except…she…told…me.
no! no, she did not say that. i-i-i think you should talk to monica now.
bing does not seem so weird now, does it?
(to the maitre d') hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (laughs.)
forty-five minutes? we have tickets to the musicman at 8:00.
is this because of the burrito thing?
give him money? it was a joke!
right, calm down, of'mally. I will slip him some money.
hey, i can be smooth. (walks back to the maitre d', very smoothly) listen, we are a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I would appreciate it. (shakes his hand)
okay. (walks back to monica)
had the money in the wrong hand. (shows her his left hand with the money in it)
how do you know so much about this?
richard used to do it, did not he?
mustached bastard…
(walks up to the maitre d') excuse me...
(finds his money) ahh-hahaha! (turns around to give the maitre d' his money, but he is not there anymore)
thank you gunther, put it there. (he gets up, and shakes gunther's hand. a bunch of coins fall out his hand. he sits down next to monica.) definitely not easier with coins. (joey gets up and picks up the coins. chandler thinks, joey is just helping him to pick them up.) thank you.
hey pheebs!
if you want to give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
(entering in a santa costume) ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!
hey! (grunts as ben hits him at full speed.)
well, I am here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?
what?
you bet i did, ben, put it there! (he shakes ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to monica) well, it would have worked this time, if his hands were not so damn small! (realizes, that ben is standing right there) ho, ho, ho!
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!
why?
but i did not get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
fine, I will give the suit back.
santa? really?
did your dad ever dress up like santa?
then it is okay! (they kiss.)
because, if santa and the holiday…armadillo? (ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas!
well, I will stay, but only because i want to hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah?
my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt. (glaring at joey who is nodding.)
(excited) guys, guys, I have got great news! guess what…
thank you. i got a job in advertising. (everybody cheers)
actually, it pays nothing. it is an internship.
right. so, it will be the same except… less sex with you. (joey nods)
well, it is a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
yeah, i mean, there is probably going to be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating
(grinning awkwardly) humiliating and noble!
(entering) good morning, everybody.
oh, no, no, I am an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that i can rent a car.
yeah, well, I am kind of heading into a new career direction and, you know, you got to start at the bottom.
right. look, i know I am a little bit older than you guys, but it is not like I am bob hope (he sits down)
the comedian? uso?!
(entering, carrying a large box) honey, I am old!
i am so much older than these other interns. i can not compete with them.
yes, but i do not think life experience with these. (he opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)
they are these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can not do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
what am i supposed to do with these?
well, first of all, they are not called "sneakers" anymore. apparently, they are called "kicks" or "skids" and i think i heard somebody say "slorps". (he takes a sneaker) and here, look: they have got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to monica) would you help me try to sell these?
no, i do not think that is the kind of thing they are looking for.
hey!
putting on the sneakers… thought I would get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…
yes, how is this: they are so uncomfortable it is like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
(sitting on the couch) you know what… these are not half-bad! (to rachel) you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren.
alright (he stands wearing the sneakers on) i feel youger already!
(on the floor) yah, i think i broke my hip.
okay… (he stands up) you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he is about my age…
a-huh. so he is rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "not suitable for adults!"
oh, thank you, sir… or man-who is-two-years-younger-than-me (he sits down again)
(over-enthusiastic) i do not know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
the cold weather hurts my hip!
(deadpan, standing next to monica) we are very happy for you.
we wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know…
(to monica) happy new year!
do you want us to leave the room, or?
that is good one too, pheebs. now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who is resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
I will take that bet my friend. and you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (ross looks at him.) and it starts right now!
nice!
(reading it) elizabeth hornswoggle?
horn-swoggle.
no. no, i just think that maybe i-I would heard it somewhere before. (sits down rubbing his temple.)
what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. y'know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.
(notices something) ross is wearing leather pants! does nobody else see that ross is wearing leather pants? (pause, no one speaks.) someone comment on the pants!
that is not what i had in mind! see, people like ross do not generally wear these types of pants. you see, they are very tight. (motions to ross's buttock.) maybe there is something in that area.
oh come on!! (storms out.)
(on phone) laundry. huh. is that my new nickname? (rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
oh my god!
oh yeah, me too. y'know if this shirt is dirty. (smells it.) yep.
(entering) oh good, okay, i can not take it anymore. i can not take it anymore. so you win, okay? here! (hands him the 50 bucks he is about to owe him.) pheebs? flying a jet? better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! and ross, phone call for you today, tom jones, he wants his pants back! and hornswoggle? what are you dating a character from fraggile rock?! (he sits down and sighs in relief.)
are you kidding me?! joey. joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey!!
oh. oh, did-did-did i wake you?
gunther, can i get another cup of coffee, please? (gunther starts to pour him another cup.) so uh, what do you do when you are not working here?
oh, okay, thanks. (he goes back to the couch and rejoins monica, joey, and phoebe.)
well, i am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I am exhausted! because joey started snoring!
it is not something to be proud of, okay? you have to go to a sleep clinic!
they do not have those.
next time you snore, I am rolling ya over!
hey, all right!
oh, she is got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses… (laughs and makes like indiana jones and his whip) wah-pah!
y’know, whipped! wah-pah!
that is what i did. wah-pah!
all right buddy, time to roll over. (rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (looking down) no-no! (covers his eyes) no, no-n-n-n-no!! you are going to a clinic! you are going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
it is 6:00.
hey, i hear that you and joshua are going out to dinner with ross and emily, and i think that is, i think that is really cool.
what?
yeah, well, i do not dance at weddings.
because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when i dance, i look like this… (starts to dancing really, really, really badly. ross enters behind him and he stops.)
hey!
nothing.
(answering for him) yes he did.
(waking joey) hey, check out that girl! she is really hot!
you are coming on to the entire room! (he goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) I am chandler.
hi.
you mind if i…
so uh, what are you in for?
what a coincidence, i listen in my sleep.
(entering) hello! little ones.
yep! and! a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (they are stunned.) joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
because I am cooler.
well she is, she is the kind of girl—joey was unconscious.
plus, you look cool.
(to monica) (in a funny voice) hi there. (monica turns her head away in disgust)
(jumping up) oh, I will go out and get you some.
nope! because I am not your boyfriend. (to phoebe, who is entering) hey pheebs, how did it go?
i found a dried up seashores.
all right, there is a nuclear holocaust, I am the last man on earth. would you go out with me?
I have got canned goods.
excellent hole, joe.
well, can we help?! you want us to take you back to the house?!
we have got to do something!
y'know what, he is right. there is something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
me too!!
oh my god! if you say that one more time, I am going to break up with you!
look, ross, you have what you want, you are back with rachel. if you bring this up now you are going to wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
(jumping up) hey! phoebe! we can talk to phoebe!!
I will give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
(running over and joining monica) they will never understand!
(following monica) we were two miles from the house. scared and alone. we did not think we could make it. (he goes to put his hands on monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
and then joey remembered something.
(wails loudly into his hands) joey kept screaming at me, “do it now! do it!! do it! do it now!!” sometimes late at night i can still here the screaming.
(entering with joey) (to monica) coffee house?
i knew it!!!!
we were playing gin? y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
okay. all right.
top of the world? dock of the bay? (he tries to think of another but can not) I am out.
well, they are joey's! they got to be joey's!
see? they are joey's! j-j-j-j-j-joey's!
yeah!
(interrupting him) all this lying has been hard on us too.
well, yeah actually.
i know it sounds really weird, but we are just so bad at relationships.
help!
hi, pheebs!
i did not know you were taking a class. that is so cool.
well, what did the police say?
ross, it is just a sandwich!
(reading) knock-knock. who is there? ross geller's lunch. ross geller's lunch, who? ross geller's lunch, please do not take me. okay?
say ross, when you picture phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie?
what is going on here?
yeah.
no-no, wait! there is got to be a better explanation. you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (thinks) adult film class.
oh—i do not know.
hey.
(gasps) you are naked in this picture!
ross?
which i may say, right now, is out of control.
and you are okay with that?
(sees the picture) oh no! no! no! no! (monica gasps as well.)
all right, look! look. i think i can explain this.
joey's a sex addict.
well let us….let us see what everybody thinks of that?
are you sure joe? are you sure you are not just a sex addict?
well, of course i do! my good friend joey over here. (pats joey’s arm, joey pats chandler’s shoulder, and chandler motions for joey to say the same about him.)
so he has to be a male who has at least $50.
(laughs) is not she cute? (on monica’s death stare) no!
so, why is she leaving? is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
oh, tell her good luck with that.
yeah. do we have any fruit roll-ups?
oh that is so funny because we found someone too.
why would our guy be a weirdo?
a face ass?
no, our guy is just a floating head.
(horrified) wait! you look? you-you massaged me.
our guy has great hair.
our guy smells incredible.
hey.
well, you…do not look good joe.
that is still in there?!
is this a service you are providing me?
our new fridge? i do not live here anymore.
uh-huh.
(not quite sure where joey’s going and is a little worried) okay…
just tell her the truth! tell her you are not ready.
then you distract her with a barbie doll.
joey, i saw you push him!
uh-huh.
hey!
wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (does a little whooping/party noise.)
i can see it now, "look dad, it is the sphinx!" (does that party noise again.)
yeah.
are you sure?! because our guy smells incredible!
are you funny?
(to monica) turns out he is kind of funny.
yeah, but sebastian? what is that? a cat’s name?
okay, so you will meet our guys?
okay now it does not matter which one you choose, y’know? it is completely up to you. our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
(to ross) well, there you are! so what did elizabeth say?
you know the hotels?
well, maybe you do not marry this one.
good-good-good-good.
hey!
tomorrow night is good. tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (laughs) eldad come here! (he stands up from the next table.)
eldad, sit down. (to rachel) move over! move over now!
there you go! there you are! (rachel stares at monica and chandler)
hi. (to phoebe) okay, you are too late okay? because she is already with our guy.
it is the softest hair! touch it! (both he and monica do so.)
(to rachel) eldad is much more cooperative! and he can dance! (to eldad) you dance for rachel!
so what was it for anyway?
yeah.
yes, joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
you have to pick your moments.
i used to have that bumper sticker.
(to rachel) you see what i mean.
mmmm. not tonight, honey. i got an early day tomorrow.
oh, ok, because we never do that.
you will get one.
all right. I will tell you what. when we are 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?
oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
no, no, no.
(trapped) uh, uh.
dear god! this parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? was, like, your father a doctor?
no reason. (turns around, makes an 'oh my god' gesture with his eyes)
where have you been?
mazel tov!
(to joey) you are really frightening me.
somebody want to help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) uh, that is great. (looking around) anybody seen a nipple?
(to nurse) let me ask you, do you have to be carol's lesbian life partner?
i know, i still am one of these.
and sometimes, I will want you to steal third, and I will go like this. (does a baseball sign.)
you mean the spitter?
easy for you to say; you will be wearing a veil.
you mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
sorry, i just do not like the idea of when i say, "i do," he is thinking, "yeah, I would do her too!"
yeah!
guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
we are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! and when i say legitimate i mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
no, but horny for monica minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
joe…
(to monica) y’know, we have not found anybody else.
yeah you can do it.
yeah.
hey!
hey!
our minister…
okay.
(to monica) should we call the spitter?
yeah. of-okay.
see joe, not that that is not grrreat! but, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! y’know, it can be more personal. you can tell stories about us!
no, not us… (motions joey and him.) us! (motions monica and him.)
see joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. nice stories.
joe?
is not that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
and i was a perfect gentleman and i walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
but then later that night…
(answering the door) hey!
well i was… i was exactly expecting company after…(he looks at his watch.) 9:15.
well, last time i saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. so uh, you are not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
well, look it is been a really emotional time y’know, and you have had a lot to drink. and you have just got to let that go okay? i mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
you kidding? you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what is going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?
but we do not do that.
how drunk are you?
(thinks) that is the perfect amount!
what?
i know.
well, i have kissed over four women. (they kiss again.) do you want to get under the covers?
okay!
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
yep!
count of three?
two!
well i think it is safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
eh!
joey! joey! joey! j-j-joey-joey-j-joey! (monica hides under the covers as joey enters. remember?)
hey joe! i was just watching a movie-e-e… (notices that the tv is turned off.)
no! no! no!
they are in my bag over there. (points.)
uh, could you leave me one?
yeah.
no i-i-I am fine.
what?
who did you originally want to hook up with?
(to monica) so you came to the room looking for joey? did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
oh, it is not important? it is not important?! if it was not for a bride’s maid you would be marrying him (points to joey) not me!
i do not believe it. the most romantic night of my life and I am runner up.
(to joey) look there is no way you are doing this wedding now. okay?
okay, it is just weird! okay? i do not want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and monica! i-i-i need…i do not know what i need. i need a walk.
it is to me. you wanted to sleep with batman, and instead you had to settle for robin. (walks out and slams the door.)
hey. do you want this scone? (holds up his plate) it came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
look joe, i know you wanted to do the wedding…
how can i not be upset? okay? i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
that is what you should say.
when you are marrying us; that is what you should say.
I would love it if you would do it.
but those are the words! those exact words!
yeah, we talked and monica made me see that i over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
happy valentine’s!
(picking up a video from the table) ‘candy and cookie’. ‘candy and cookie?’ monica got me porn?! girl-on-girl porn?! she really must love me!! (chandler runs over to the tv, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some "porn")
i love you, st. valentine.
woah, woah, that is not pretty!
worst porn ever! worst porn ever! (chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)
i am trying!
(pointing at the video) why did you get me this?
it is yelling…bleeding…dilating. oh, the dilating…
i thought…maybe…you got me porn for valentine’s day.
well, I am not really in a sexy mood right now.
well, remember the first time we saw jaws?
how long it took to go back in the water?
you do not know. you did not see it.
oh, beautiful? really? beautiful? you think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he is going to throw up!)
see, honey, there is—(puts his hand on her leg)
90 seconds.
you know, it haunts me? up ‘til now, the worst thing i ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. after this, i would gladly make that my screensaver!
i can do that.
okay. now all we have got to do is get rid of this chair.
oh, i know!
poor ross.
oh, great. we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: do not watch it.
well, let us just say it is ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) okay, here we go.
why have i seen this thing three times?!
wait, you guys, look!
no, the baby’s out! look, look!
and look how happy the mom is now!
(going to the bedroom) see joe, that is why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
hey.
well, I am sorry joe. i did not think the doctor was going to buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
because the kids need new shoes.
do i look fat?
okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow.
okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her....
okay, so you both just know this stuff?
that is easy, baggage claim.
okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I am all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. so, uh, how do i tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
thank you rachel.
well, i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
yeah.
okay, the old hug and roll.
okay, one question.
you are pretending the pillow's a girl right?
umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom.
hey, joe, i got to ask. the girl from the xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
well, your going to need much bigger jars.
that, that is what is stupid.
night-night.....janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. that would be weird though. okay, hug and roll time. I am huggin', I am huggin', your rollin', and....yes! freedom! (his one arm is still under her) except for this arm! I am stuck. stuck arm! okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. quick like a cat, quick like a cat! and 1...2...3!' (pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
no, that is all right. i just had a jar of mustard.
you mean there is more than one of us.
and that is how you bought it?
pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
sure. what is up?
there is a hair in my coffee.
you know, it is funny. every time you say "triplets," i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
i mean, you have a lovely home.
that is great. (to monica.) can i see the book?
you want me to wash my hands first, do not you?
hey, you must be owen.
I am chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too.
yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
you know how to use a compass?
you do? that is fantastic!
I would love to, but i got to get back to talking to your parents. they are telling us all about how they adopted you.
what?
i got nothing.
where are bill and colleen?
we have to leave!!
i did not get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he did not know he was adopted. and there is a slight chance i may have told him.
but kids are so intuitive. do not you think on some level he already knows?
see? intuitive!
which technically now you should give back!
I am so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "owen does not know he is adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real."
owen did not know he was adopted, and monica told him.
yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
I am going to go tell emma she was an accident. (runs off.)
(entering) hey!
pheebs, i do not understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
hey-hey! i thought naked thursday’s was just our thing man!
who was it?
sure!
well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big-big ones!
okay so you mean no as in, "gee chandler, what an interesting idea. let us discuss it before we reject it completely."
so, that is it?
which is why asteroids is perfect! it is the oldest game!
i do not have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
no, I am not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (exits.)
nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight.
(reading the ad) "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." nice!
hi.
hi, listen, I am sorry about before. i do not need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i could not get girls, and now i can ‘them—now, i have you. (monica glares at him.) not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women…
really?
ohh.
that is a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
we do not have to come up with this now.
hey, y’know what? why do not we think about changes we can make in the living room?
yeah, i mean we are going to have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (kisses her and heads into the living room.)
is that a problem?
oh, that is cool. then I will just bring them both over.
okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! I will get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
in the game room!
all right! that is fine! that is fine! i will not bring over the chairs! i will not bring anything over! i would not want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma’s place!! (storms out.)
(entering) you can call off the roommate search! (to the potential roommate) hi! I will be living here. (heads for the bathroom.)
why did you take the shower curtain down?
well, why do not you tell her to stop being silly! (monica mocks him and he joins in.)
well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
that is laughter.
i do not know.
yeah, i do.
he is being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
yeah, I am not so worried.
of course!
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
okay!
oh my god! someone is killed square man!
oh that is so sweet! i want to show you something too!
y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge?"
y’know? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. because, that is you and i together! merge!
really?!
hey joe! you want to shoot some hoops?
that is great.
you will be perfect for this! that is already your name!
okay, i guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
bamboozled?
(simultaneously with ross) no!
well joey, I am a headhunter. i hook up out of work soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. hi rasputin! (waves.)
bogota.
what does a wicked wango card do?
higher or lower than what?
(to ross) can you believe how lame this is?
this is ridiculous, he is not going to hold his breath… (ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
let me see that.
triscadecaphobia.
fear of triscuts?
this game makes no sense!
oh come on ross, i think we are all losers here.
let me think. let me think—oh! i do not care.
either, it makes no difference.
I will take a card.
this game is kind of fun.
i do not think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
treasure of the sierra madre!
madre sierra the of treasure!
I would like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
six!
(disappointed and simultaneously as ross) hungry monkey.
tell it to the time turtle!
(annoyed) oh come on!!
I would like a google card.
yes! (pause) no! (pause) google!
nooo!!
this is the best game ever!!!
(to ross) monica said wedding.
do you think you could get through a poem?
too?
well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking. (winks in a spy-type manner.)
that is great!
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
do not do it.
i think it is the dying cat parade.
(turning around and looking) oh my god!
y’know that thing that ross was going to do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "you are half scottish right?"
yes!!
why is your family ross?!
if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang.
well, i feel like a snack!
oh no thanks. i do not like any thing from my scottish heritage.
well it is just my entire family was run out of scotland by…vikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. (makes a few unintelligible noises.)
we heard you play all the way from your apartment!
that is not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just do not feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
because we hate them.
we have heard you play.
well, if you are going to work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
you know, i can not believe you. linda is so great! why will not you go out with her again?
is this still about her whole 'the flintstones could have really happened' thing?
...little playthings with yarn?
could you want her more?
(sarcastically) dee, the sarcastic sister from what is happening.
we are not—we are not saying anything.
(to the girls) we were playing poker, alright...
and then he did.
there just do not happen to be any women in our games.
(teaching) ok, so now we draw cards.
ok phoebs, how many do you want?
(changing subject) ok, so at this point, the dealer...
ok, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) joey... three... eight. eight... three. (joey is unamused) alright babe, deal the cards.
rach, rach, we got to settle.
the... jamestown colony of virginia. you see, king george is giving us the land, so...
yes, and i get my ya-yas from ikea. you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
oh, did you get that from the 'i love rachel' pizzeria?
oh, come on. what was with that whole black bart speech? (mimicking): "when i play poker, I am not a nice guy!"
um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they are all recommending trident?
oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, i do not know... pictionary?
that is alright, I will take it. bad things happen to me anyway. this way i can break  them up with a movie.
hey, that is... that is 'joincidence' with a 'c'!
could not be more out. (throws in cards)
y'know, I have had dates like this.
call.
(to ross): what do you need, what do you need?
alright, here is ten. (gives it to him)
good luck.
(to ross): i thought we had them!
airplane! airport! airport '75! airport '77! airport '79!
go.
yeah. hey, here is an idea, why do not we use our wedding china today?
honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
what is the point of having them if we never use them?
i will explain it to her.
muskogee! that is like four hours from tulsa. woo hoo!
are not you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap days of our lives?
what are you going to do?
well you proved them wrong.
I will tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I will be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this is not the china we picked out..
why?
oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
i can not believe you would want us to raise emma.
you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know I have had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>
no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right?
actually what?
what?
so if monica's not around, then I am not good enough to raise emma?
well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I am not capable?
ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table>  she would have to give her up.
so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?
yeah but they are right. i mean, I am not a strong father figure and i never will be.
yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it.
oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "go to your room! you are grounded"?
you said that to me last week.
oh no that is okay, you are totally right. i do not know anything about disciplining a child. but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die, you do not get joey.
alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can not act your age then you should not be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they are very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now.
okay. that is better. now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
by the way, that fight was totally arousing.
oh yeah? well thanks.
okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
oh no no no.. I will get her. I am super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. I will be right there emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> well.. what do you know? i guess, I will be the one who dies first.
nope...
yep...
nope... (monica walks in) hey... so I am going to... put the plates back. you know, i think you were right, i do not think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
maybe not even then. (joey walks in)
sydney portier? hehheh.
oh! that is great, they have not seen the place since i moved in!
(shocked at the news) why can not i tell them that we live together?
why have not you told them?!
why have not you told them?! would not they be happy?!
why would not they be happy?
what? what? why?!
is this why they do not like me or why you do not like me?
y’know, it will be okay. it will be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then we will tell ‘them.
hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, did not i?
hey! (sees ross is there) oh, good, ross! you are parents like me, right?
well monica just told me that they do not.
(annoyed) do you know why?
(angry) well if people do not know they should not just guess!
this is great, another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment.
[mocks that last comment].
hey.
mr. and mrs. geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
whoa, snowing out there?
yeah, ross sure is a great guy, y’know I have always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
(worried) he is the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
oh, yes. well it is very beautiful. it is cream-colored and tight [realizes what he just said and looks worried. monica and ross also looked shocked. judy and jack give chandler a very dirty look.] i do not mean tight, i mean it is not too tight, not that i was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
(shocked) what?
you do? why?
what?! why did you do that?
how could it not matter?!
what about all that “friends forever” stuff?
your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
the reason we have not told them we are together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?
yeah, I am not going to pay for those acting classes anymore.
(clearly lying and hating the dessert) yeah, this is so good, that I am going to go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert.
(lying) yes, but if it is any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
thank you!
(in a parent-like tone) I will talk to them!
oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (sits up) who said that?
and you wonder why ross is their favorite?
what are you doing?
it is a dog.
it is your parents’ anniversary and you are going to talk about their dead pet?
yeah, sure. what do you need? we got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (pause) and i think my testacles may be in here too.
ha!
yeah.
i do not think the flash went off.
somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
what are you doing?
ya know if you want to, i can just hold them down and you could (punches the air).
okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (does so.)
okay. okay.
that sounds like my first bike. (they all turn and look at him.) my dad gave me his old one.
hey! what are you guys doing?
I am sorry, who?
but we do not know the neighbors.
would not it be easier if we just moved?
eh, somebody is in a good mood!
well, either that or uh…(motions towards joey’s door.)
(about to cry) am not!
do not worry, I am brave! i am brave! i…i am brave! (they get to the door and monica goes to open it.) no-no-no-no!! (he stops her.) (through the door.) can you tell me who is there please?
(laughs) 4:00 a.m.
i am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (monica looks at him) (to monica) he does not know that i am not some of us.
mm! night gar’! (monica closes the door.)
hey, you cry every time somebody talks about titanic!
hey! so are you enjoying the bike?
(with his mouth full) what happened? I am just eating candy.
absolutely! y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
what is the matter with you?
maybe, is not she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
y’know what would work?
stop making candy!
you mean they like you.
is that why you became a chef? so that people would like you?
(asking a man leaning against the wall) what is going on?
joey!
what are you doing?
get in here! (they head for the door and chandler sees smokes-a-lot lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) hey, and you can not smoke in here! (takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (exhaling in ecstasy) merry christmas.
all right everybody! just be quiet! be quiet! be quiet!! pipe-pipe-pipe down! (they settle down) what is the matter with you people?! this woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. she was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I will bet that not one of you can tell me her name! am i right?
no not (imitating) candy lady.
all right, y’know what? forget it, all of you forget it! you have ruined it! go home! you have ruined it! you have ruined it!
you are welcome. (they kiss.)
no! smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. eh-uh—are you okay?
…come on! why are we here?!
the hot chicks?
wow that is actually pretty cool.
sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system.
you did not bring me here to do that, did you?
oh…my…gawd! i am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? you did not tell her we were getting married, did you?
did she freak out?
right.
(laughs) you said no right?
you said no right?!
lie!!! how hard is that?! the check’s in the mail! oh your baby is so cute! i can not wait to read your book ross!!
what do you think she is just going to sit there quietly? you do not think she is going to want to make a toast? you do not think she is going to want to grab the microphone and sing part-time lover?!
y’know what? it is going to be okay. y’know what? she is probably not going to even want to come.
no! that was a lie! see how easy that was?
yes!!
yes!!!
well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. um, it is going to be a small ceremony. uh, tiny! we are not even sure why we are having it.
i say we go with careless whisper.
(to monica) did she see us yet? did she see us?
are not you just a tinsy bit curious?
no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
is that what you are thinking about right now?
janice, I am sorry but umm, you can not stay here tonight.
honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
say again?
feelings, such strong feelings.
i just wanted to show monica your book. (ross just glares at him.)
ohh. mmm.
hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
(nervously) it was at the front door. when i got home. somebody sent it to us.
i—no! i did not read the box before i opened it. and you can not return a box after you have opened the box.
because it is too delicious.
no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is going to send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (reading the label) momma’s little bakery. (pause) i feel terrible, I am a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
so…
oh, what is at 8:00?
well, maybe since the age of 9, frannie’s made some new friends.
i used to undress my cousin glenn. (monica looks at him then sushes him.)
another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again!
i can not seem to say goodbye.
well I have forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
(closing the box) y’know what? forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
good idea. where do you want to go to lunch?
well, thank you for lunch.
so apparently we just do not pay for food anymore. (rachel laughs then chandler notices something.) do you see what i see?
mrs. braverman must be out. (they move closer to it.)
by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we do not want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
well, we do not want that.
but we should take it.
why?
go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! (rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
I am full, and yet i know if i stop eating this, I will regret it.
what are you doing tonight?
dude! dude! (motions that joey should pull up his pants.)
oh really? uh, monica said she had a date at 9:00.
that is what monica said.
are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (she tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) how can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
y’know what? i do not trust you with this cake anymore! and i got it first, and I am takin’ it back! (grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)
oh yes!
oh yes!
oh yes! oh yes!
well that is not fair, you have already had some!
what do we use to split it?
(examining the cake) okay well, this side looks bigger. uh… there is more crust on this side. y’know? so, maybe if i measured…
all right, I will pick that one. (points.)
(gloatingly and holding his piece) ohhh!
oh-ho-ho-ho-no! no! no switching! no sharing, and do not come crying to me! ha-ha-ha! i may just sit here and have my cake all day! just sit here in the hallway and eat my… (rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. that process leaves just the forkful chandler has, rachel starts to go after that little bit and chandler retreats into his apartment.)
stick to your side!
(to monica) wow! listen, we had a good run. what was it? four? five months? i mean, that is more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (he kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
oh, I am going on the lamb.
well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica.
look, we are not just messing around! i love her. okay, I am in love with her.
(interrupting) whoa-whoa-whoa! we are having kids?!
yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
hey listen, come on, joey is having a problem! a little girl is beating him up.
(to rachel) sounds like a fun party.
very, very funny, but do not say things like that in front of monica. i do not want you putting any ideas in her head.
wh-wh-why?!
yeah, so, what is that supposed to mean?!
i do not see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who is to say what she wants?! I am right. I am right. am i right?
okay. it is not different at all, is it?
hmm.
yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (gets up.)
yeah, I am cool. casual.
I am just hanging out. y'know, having fun. y'know with the girl that I am seeing casually.
what?!
well, you do want all that stuff, right?
yes! you want babies! you have baby fever!
oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that is related to babies and-and marriage! I have got an idea, why do not we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
well, i did not know that.
it is going to be okay, right? i mean she is not going to leave me? this is, this is fixable.
by me?
monica. (goes to talk to her.)
just tell me what i need to do to make things right.
well, that is what we do. y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think I am all cute again.
where is monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it is urgent! is she here?
i need to talk to you, it is urgent!
okay, I have been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there is only one-one way to do this. (he slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
(getting out a ring box) monica…
will you marry me?
i do not know. but i know I am not afraid to do this.
I am doing this because I am sorry?
no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (laughs.) will you be my wife?
yeah, I am kind of wishing everyone was not here right now.
yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys. (turns to look at ross and joey.)
i did not think i was!
well i would have been happy because i would have be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would have seen a chandler shaped hole in that door. (points at the door.)
okay, how long is this going to go on.
that is not funny.
oh yeah, but do not worry. i do not think anybody's going to focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
all right, i suppose i can wait a day. hey, what are you doing friday?
i need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin albert, y'know he is the botanist.
yeah. is that a dinosaur tie?
(to phoebe) it must take you forever to find your keys.
(to ross) hey, so can you make it on friday?
well apparently albert has no friends. he is very excited about the bachelor party though. i think actually the only reason he is getting married is so he can see a stripper.
well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
do not do anything. keep it inside. learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) do not cry outloud.
i want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
I will get you the cliff notes.
the abridgment.
....three years of modern dance with twila tharp! five years with the american ballet theater?!
oh no, no, no, no.
all right, i have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) hello? (listens) (happily) hi! yeah listen, I am, I am in need of a stripper and i was told that you do that. (listens) let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) so would i, would i have to provide the grapes?
okay, we have our stripper. a miss crystal chandelier.
to yourself. (finishing) hey-hey-hey, y'know what that is pretty good.
bye-bye.
what, what, what?!
you really think that is what he meant?
look, do not you see what is happening here. instead of hitting on her right away, he is becoming her confidant. now he is going to be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
well, why do not you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. all right look, you are going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
all right fine, do not do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. and he is being mr. joe sensitive, and she starts thinking 'maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
he paints quite a picture does not he?
oh yeah, yeah! look what i got, look what i got. (holds up a pen) see, she is fully dressed, right?
and then you click it and, uh-oh, she is naked. and then, and then you click it again and she is dressed. she is a business woman, she is walking down the street, she is window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she is naked! (rachel just stares at him.)
y'know what, I am, I am going to spend some alone time with the pen.
oh, okay ross. listen, this pen is kind of getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
man, i got to get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
yeah. either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
ye-e-es!!
who is number two? one of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
bye!
yeah, and i do not have any cologne.
oh! worm medicine for the duck.
(entering, carrying the chick and duck) hey! can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?
okay. i just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
(seeing joey) there he is!
almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
i know.
so that is the girl you like.
wait a minute, wait a minute, you do not like the guy rachel’s dating? well, that is odd.
could i borrow it?
oh-ho-ho-ho.
7:15. (monica looks at him) watch does not work.
yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!
ross, do not. ross!
ohh, that is a good one.
why do not you use ours across the hall, ‘because she…has…problems.
step away from the duck.
and yet, she is still not hanging up the phone.
(entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that monica is the only one there) ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I am so glad you guys are all here! my office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! no-no, vomit tux!
well y'know a lot of those muppets do not have thumbs.
uhh, yeah. she uh, she uh, she uh might have mentioned him.
yeah, i do not think he is up to meeting everyone yet.
really?! that is what you heard? (to monica) you said that?
because I am very happy for him! (to monica) and you, you lucky dog!
yes!
(entering) hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question?
if you are cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard?
why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you would ever had, I would be going like this. (he jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
yes!
well, you can not just not see rachel anymore, she is one of your best friends.
that is true!
that is true!
hey, there he is! there he is!
how many times have i told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
hey!
oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
expect it in 4-6 weeks. (she starts to leave.) umm, hey, umm, joey's going to be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
well i just, thought maybe you would want to book some time with the best you would ever had.
why?
what is your point?
(entering) look, maybe i got carried away before. but there is something you got to know. if I am the best, it is only because you have made me the best.
i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which would not take long. but when I am with you, and we are together, oh…my…god.
oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. we are too good! we owe it, to sex!
well, i was kind of hoping we could do this without him. (she starts to take off her latex gloves.) oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
yeah, why do not we lose the gloves.
all right, let us show them how it is done.
y'know that was not part of it?
nope.
(entering in a bathrobe) i just walked in the bathroom and saw kathy naked! it was like torture!
it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean it is bad enough that I am in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, i think she knows. because every time we are in the room together there is this weird like energy between us. and call me crazy, but i think she likes me too. and now i have seen her naked. i mean at least when I have seen her with clothes on, i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. but there are no boles, she is smooth! smooth! (leaves)
(rushing up) hey-hey-hey! who was that?
going out, huh? wow! wow! (does a little celebration dance) so things did not work out with kathy, huh? bummer.
(shocked) what?
wait! you are going out with kathy!
well, I am upset—for you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (he can not believe he just sad that.)
look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that she is-she is smart, and funny, and gets you.
all right look, i think it is time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane.
all right! bring it on, you…
(interrupting) oh my god! play!
really, bitchin’!
you mean like, music?
yeah, i know what you are thinkin’! yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
come in!
uh yes, but uh, i just watch it for the articles.
no-no, he is not back yet, but he will be here any minute. so uh, come on in. have a seat. bow or stern?
i like it in the stern. (realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (the phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) hello.
what happened?
why can not you tell her?
joey! joey!!
i thought your time ran out.
(to kathy) uhh, that was joey. he is running a little late, he says he is sorry.
so i guess it is just uh, you and me then.
yeah, i think it is!
oh, i had an appointment to get my haircut…
…and then it got canceled.
really?! you do that?
dog grooming huh? okay, just do not make my tail too poofy.
well, thanks. i grow it myself. (kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) y’know who also has great hair is joey!
what-what ‘cha doing?
‘kay.
(jumping up to answer the phone) oh the phone! the phone’s making sounds! (on phone) hello!
hey it is joey!
what?
okay.
oh yeah man. (to kathy) joey. (hands her the phone.)
yeah. yes! yeah.
oh.
no-no-no-no, this is bad! it is bad! this is bad!
wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
okay!
ooh! yes! okay! here is what we do, we-we forget it happened.
okay, we-we swallow our feelings. even if it means we are unhappy forever. sound good?
i have to; he is my best friend, and you are seeing him.
(interrupting) oh-no-no-no! do not! do not! see-see, you are getting me confused, I am starting to urn.
i-i think we have too.
bye. (kathy leaves and chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) are you still out there?
hang on buddy! (he goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
i sure did.
well, i just thought it would make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
oh no-no-no. this is amazing. (he goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the tv.)
well, y’know I am 29. i mean who needs a savings account.
oh, i do not know.
you mean with casey.
or casey.
could be casey.
consider casey.
that all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
i kissed kathy.
no. is there anyway, anyway you think he will understand this?
oh, do not say that! do not say that. that is not true. is it?
then why did not you tell me to do that?!!
god!! (sits down in disgust.) what am i going to do?!
why?! why do i have to tell him?!
yeah, i know.
hey!
is that a real thing?
listen ah, joe, i-i need to, i need to talk to you about something.
it is-it is about kathy. umm, uh, i like her. i like her a lot actually.
yeah.
what?
oh uh, when?
oh man, i am so sorry. are, are you okay?
yes, but i-i uh, do not have too.
yeah?
well, i thought that would be the best thing to do.
see uh, that is-that is actually what i wanted to talk to you about. i-i think i know who the other guy is.
it is me. I am the other guy.
yeah, i mean when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking, and one thing to another and…
no! no! no! i just kissed her.
how is that worse?!
look, I am sorry! but there is nothing i can do, i think I am in love with her!
you are right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line.
yes. yes! right! and i feel horrible. you have to believe me!
probably because…
this is so sad. i mean, i only have like ten pins.
y’know i think we should invite them.
well this is just sad!
well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up rach. i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
(sees another rack) well, what is the deal with these? these-these look nice.
you mean like for award shows?
you mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "you are you wearing?! you look fabulous!"
okay, who wore those? (points to the tuxedos.)
not bad.
who is that?
pierce brosnan?
are you serious?
007?! this is james bond’s tux?!
oh, i have to get married in james bond’s tux!
oh, it is not just that, i would be england’s most powerful weapon. jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. a man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (worried.) would monica let me wear this?
a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
what?
you can not wear that! I am wearing the famous tux! james bond’s tux!
so—if you wear that you will make mine less special.
please, do not take away my cool thing. please?! pretty please?!
look, it is my wedding day okay? if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you.
that was pretty 007.
ross is batman!
rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman. okay batman is so much cooler than james bond!
batman has a utility belt!
batman has the batmobile!
batman has robin! (pause) we get espn right?
actually, i do not like martinis.
ooh, yum! (runs into the bedroom.)
i would but mine does not fit. the pants are a little tight.
well, does that mean that you are not going to wearing yours?
(standing up) let me try it on!
(trying on the jacket) okay. holy double-vented comfort batman! (finds something in the pocket) what is this?
an invitation for the at first sight premiere? oh my god! val kilmer did not wear this in batman! he wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
the only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (hands him the jacket and walks away.)
well, you are welcome. and tell them we are really glad they are coming.
(yelling from the changing room) all right! i found one that fits!
whose is it?
whose is it?
oh, come on! i do not care! come on! whose is it?
do you realize you get louder each week?
i figured I would buy those. pat, I would like to buy a vow. (laughs)
right. so uh, have you written yours yet?
do you happen to know what I am going to say?
(watching in her) (in his head) look at her go! she must love me more than i love her! what is wrong with me? ooh, do not open that door.
(writing) monica, there are no words… (to joey and ross) there are no words! this should not be this hard!
I am so pathetic! monica knows what she wants to say! you should have seen her. writing, writing, writing!
yeah, I am not sure i can do that.
(seeing her) okay.
all right, there is a nuclear holocaust, I am the last man on earth. would you go out with me?
(shocked) there are seven?! (points to one) that is one?
oh, y’know-y’know what, i was looking at it upside down.
(writing) monica…
(writes what joey said and waits for him to go on) yeah?
you will get one.
all right. I will tell you what. when we are 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?
oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
no, no, no.
(trapped) uh, uh.
dear god! this parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
nice try.
look, monica…
this is not going to work.
you are so great! i love you!
nothing! i said, i said "you are so great" and then i just, i just stopped talking!
no i did not!
no i did not!
no i do not! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
 y’know i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here?
well, what if all my stuff was here?
okay. what if we lived together and you understand what I am saying?
oh my god.
okay! (he joins her on one knee) okay! okay! I will do it!  oh god, i thought… (starting to cry, pauses) wait a minute, i-i can do this. (pause) i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you, (pause) you make me happier than i ever thought i could be. (starting to cry again.) and if you will let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (pause as he gets out the ring.) monica, will you marry me?
I have had a very long, hard day.
ahh, no thanks. no chicken, bye-bye then.
are you okay? I am so sorry, he would not leave. he kept asking me about chicken.
hey joe!
yeah, can i get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a coke—(yelps in pain as monica grabs him underwater)—diet coke.
it happened in london.
the reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a big deal out of it.
no-no-no-no-no! you can not!
(on phone) laundry. huh. is that my new nickname? (rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
(after they have left) okay, did you see that?! with the inappropriate and the pinching!!
okay, so now do you believe that she is attracted to me?
phoebe knows about us!
ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
listen, this is totally getting out of hand! okay? she wants me to put lotion on her!
look, she is not backing down! she went like this! (he does a little mimic of her dance.)
okay, give me a second! (pause) did you clean up in here?
oh, you are-you are going?
(swallowing hard) it is very, very nice. well, come here. I am very happy were going to have all the sex.
not if i kiss you first.
well, i guess there is nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
okay! okay! okay! you win! you win!! i can not have sex with ya!
because I am in love with monica!!
love her! that is right, i…love…her!!! i love her!! (they walk together and hug.) i love you, monica.
yes, and we would appreciate it if no one told him yet.
who are those people?
what is going on?
so we both finished our vows.
do not worry honey, we will make yours funnier.
okay, what do you guys think?
you really like it?
i stole monica’s and changed the name.
oh! right. umm, maybe that is because i did not send him an invitation.
i do not even know the man. okay? we are not the close. i have not seen him in years.
well he does not have to know! it is not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas.
trust me, you do not want him there either. okay? nobody is going to be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
what is this?
are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! no more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—think of the money we will save!! (monica just looks at him.) we are not eloping. i love the flowers. can our wedding be bigger please?
y’know we already went over this and i won!
look forget it okay? i do not want to go. i do not want to see him. i do not want to.
no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you would have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. y’know it is hard enough to be fourteen. you are skinny. you are wearing speedoes—that your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and there is your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
he had sex with mr. girabaldi!
does it matter?!
yeah of-okay, but I am just doing this for you.
so i really never get to win anymore?
yeah, i just ordered a beer! (pounds the table.)
no! no! i do not want him to know we are yet! I am not sure I am ready for that. and besides he is not going to be too happy to see me either.
i do not know if I have told you this, but he is kind of tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
yeah, he is made phone calls, written letters, he even came to new york, but i always said i was too busy to see him. y’know it is all very cats in the cradle—i do not want to get into it. (the show starts.) here we go.
and there is daddy!
believe me, I have been saying that for years. oh my god!
that is mr. girabaldi playing the piano.
he is coming into the audience. he is coming into the audience.
it can not happen like this. okay? I will meet you back at the hotel.
(resigning himself to his fate) chandler. (he quickly sits down.)
oh, they are a hoot.
actually monica and i are engaged.
wait! wait! we would really love it if you could be there.
i know it would make me happy, madam.
yeah. thanks for making me do this.
(to monica) when i was growing up i…played the one on the far left.
are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
y'know, we do not have to watch this. weekend at bernie's is on showtime, hbo, and cinemax.
exactly. weekend at bernie's! dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! no?
yeah, well, you would not think it was cool if you are eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'mistress bitch.'
you can say that because she is not your mom.
shhh, busy beaming with pride.
now why would she say that is embarrassing?
that is too much information!!
this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone.
...and then he burst into flames.
please god do not let it be kung pow chicken.
well, i think you need to come out of your she will just a little.
i know i am.
myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
what are you guys doing out here?
okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (goes back inside and shuts the door)
oh my god.
i can not believe it. paolo kissed my mom?
what?
(to joey) you knew about this?
i spent the entire day with you, why did not you tell me?!
(to ross) i can not believe this! what the hell were you thinking?
y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you.
i can not believe you did this. (walks toward the door)
I am still mad at you for not telling me.
you got to let me slam the door! (leaves; slams the door)
what was that?
yeah, i believe i was talking to joey, alright there, mother-kisser? (goes to the counter)
yes, well, i expect this from her. okay? she is always been a freudian nightmare.
because it is complicated, it is complex- hey, you kissed my mom!
that is very funny. we done now?
that would be no. look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom does not mean you know her. alright? trust me, you can not talk to her.
no, just knowing you are going to be there is enough.
you kissed my best ross! ...or something to that effect.
really stupid.
yeah. no. no...
yeah, okay.
nice save.
hey.
yeah, why not. (they shake hands) so i told her.
awful. awful. couldn'ta gone worse.
pretty good! i told her.
sorry man.
did they teach you that in your anger management class?
oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the christmas party.
i know, i can do this. (he takes her hand.)
i asked myself that very question, sir. uh, (points to monica) this is monica. (points to his boss.) this is my boss, doug. doug this is monica.
no, sir.
what?
oh, that was my work laugh.
oh, believe me, to survive this party, you are going to have to come up with one too.
okay.
hey! everybody at work loved you last night!
and! they like me more just because i was with ya! i think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met joey. and doug wants us to play tennis with them. he is never even talked to me outside of work. except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (she glares at him.) strip church. anyway, I am going to go try and find a racquet.
oh i used too, but then joey thought it would be fun to go to central park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (he starts to leave and stops an entering rachel.) hey rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
okay, good luck with that. (exits.)
okay, easy martina. i think we should let them win the next game.
let them win one.
you are not even giving them a chance!
oh yes, sir! put me out of my misery. are you sure you never played pro? (does his work laugh.) (to monica) please let them win!
oopsey, missed it!
long! (gives monica the work laugh.)
yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
it was my racquet.
if we had not lost the game they never would have invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
okay y'know what, because you said that, I am not putting out tonight.
just a little bit of sugar.
oh, you get used to it.
so i laugh at my boss's jokes, what is the big deal?
oh. (does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
what?
well, i-i just did not think it was funny sir.
well, i just…
really?
i think i do! (they all laugh.) thank you, monica.
coffee in a fight! (does the laugh again.)
(from his bedroom) all right, so you are telling me that i have to tell racist jokes now?!
but we are not ready to tell yet!
man, she is really gullible.
okay.
why would i be mad?
(realizes what ross just said and the implications to him) i am mad! but you know what I am going to do? I am going to forgive you! because that is what friends do! they forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. well, but i want you to remember that i forgave you.
i also want you to remember that i let you live here rent free!
and, i want you to remember that i gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. no strings attached. now, if you can not remember that, i think we should write it down—let us write it down!
you know me sir. oh ah, i do have a question for ya. do you know how i get around the office computer network so i can access the really good internet porn?
what is funny about that?
hey that is okay. so, where do you want to go?
the hard rock caf�?
again?!
you like the purple rain display! (a guy walks up.) hey bob.
yeah, he thinks that is my name.
oh it is been going on way to long now. y’know, i mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so i did not say anything. and then the next time he said, "hey toby, do you want a donut?" and i-i wanted a donut. and now it is five years later, the donut’s gone and I am still toby.
no! that would be so awkward! look—besides, we work in different departments. he is on the sixth floor y’know? so he calls me toby once in a while. what is the big deal? it could be worse, it is not like he is calling me muriel. (chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
shh! it is a family name!
hey bob.
if i see him, I will ask.
yeah!
we are on a semi-first name basis.
bob? ooh, working here with us? everyday? yeah, i do not know if he has what it takes.
but this is eleven. it is almost twice as hard up here.
i think it is best sir.
y’know what you should do, just toss ‘them in the shedder and claim you never got ‘them.
what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
sure, what is up?
hey bobby.
uhh yeah. yeah, it is (points down the hall) right, right down there. (when he has bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) right there, yeah. can i ask you why?
okay bob listen uhh, I am the reason you did not get the job up here.
bob!
well that puts me in a difficult position.
(entering) bob. bob! bob!!! (he turns around) what the hell are you doing?!
he pulled a quarter out of my ear!
okay. wow.
sure.
that was you?! i thought it was jack!
what?! why does she think that?
again, what?!
as we all are at some point during the day.
ross had a ring?! and he was going to propose?
and you did it first?! this is going to kill him! you know how much he loves to propose!
well, what did she say?
does ross know?
well maybe you do not have to tell him anything.
if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
honey, we have been over this. i need to be facing the other way.
I am so tired. (she starts kissing him.) yeah okay, but no foreplay.
hello sir, you know monica.
look, we can not stay in here forever.
this is okay. we are all adults here; there is nothing to be ashamed of. now, let us put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (they do so and find mr. geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that was not for fun.
(to monica) why? why-why-would you—wh-why… (to mr. geller) look, i just do not want you to think that we are animals who do it whenever we want.
that is funny, this conversation’s how i got the bullet hole in my head.
seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall.
you still have not told rachel you were not really proposing?
joey, you have to tell her what is going on! and what did it look like?!
go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out.
okay, look, just do it gently.
hey.
tell me what?
(sarcastically) oh, come on tell me. i could use another reason why women will not look at me.
wow!
more importantly, was i any good?
interesting, because in my dreams, I am allways surprisingly inadequate. (monica pats him on his lap)
you are okay there?
I am sorry, it was a one-time-thing. i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
hello rachel.
pirates again?
(sarcasticly) thanks joey, that is a good idea.
well, my secretary is going to be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused. (ross looks at her.) it is a whole big boob story.
well, you know phoebs. i do not know if it is your kind of thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day.
a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
when we were?
whoa! and this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
can you hear that?
see that will stop when you pick up the phone.
I am not in a meeting. I am right... whoops.
what?
ah!
well, now, i actually have to get to work.
okay.
bye bye.
(answering it) yes?
ooh. (leans against the desk)
see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (joey and ross wonder what he means) me.
why not?
what?!
noho. who does not they like me?
what are you talking about?
i can not belive it.
they do me?
i do not sound like that.
okay, i do not sound like that. that is so not true.
that is so not... that is so not... that... oh, shut up!
oh, come on. you told me about the last dream.
oh, why not. was i doing anything particularly... saucy?
and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
tyrannosaurus!
work people? nobody told me.
you know, i do not get this. a month ago, these people were my friends. you know, just because I am in charge does not mean I am a different person.
you think i should?
okay.
okay.
i think last night was great. you know, the karaoke thing. tracy and i doing ebony and ivory.
what?
then, i do not get it.
they do?
i just wan't to...
but i just wa...
thanks. listen, about the weekly numbers, I am going to need them on my desk by nine of the clock.
you have to give  them something, you know. okay, now that was gerston, santos, and who is the guy with the moustache?
petrie, right, right. okay, some people going to be working this weekend.
(doing a little dance) hey ross, look what I have got going here.
yeah, like in a cab...
okay, hating this.
here we go, here we go.
hey!
so we thought we would throw you little going away party around seven.
where is your passport?
well, it is not.
we are taking a break!
jumping on the bed?
no, no, no, guys. she is right. we should get to work. I will take stuff out of the closet, joey you pack  them and ross you re-pack whatever joey packs.
(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) what the hell is this?
i did not know monica had these!
why would she use them with richard and not me? i can be kinky! i once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
hey.
i know, she is been such a big part of my life. and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled. (ross and joey looks puzzled) i mean... oh, forget it. i miss melrose place!
yes, joe?
oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you want to engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
really? then what are they doing in our guestroom?
rachel... with handcuffs! interesting! (he looks excited)
(he does not look excited anymore). well played.
uh, rach?
(to rachel) uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
no, no, no... they are really yours. we... found them in your old room.
do not say richard! well, if they are not monica's and they are not yours, then whose are they?
pheebs!
i think these are yours.
sure. (to phoebe) you do not really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
let me just say something... because once we get into this, I am going to get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, I am going to miss you. and I am so sad that you are leaving.
ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I am sorry, just give me one more chance.
I am sor... just go. just go. i can not, i can not.
oh, you are definately not. i have not cried like that in years.
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
mine was a humdinger
well, you can not say we do not know how to throw a party.
joey and i can finish up in the guest room.
(to joey) you could not be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are.
well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used.
monica's grandmother.
relax! we just get her some antacids.
oh my god!
honey, it is going to be okay.
what?
I am good.
(looking) is that a swing?
yuck!
that was like 5 years ago.
joey…
(totally not crying) well see now that i can see crying over, but bambi is a cartoon!
yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
I am not macho.
no, i guess i just never really cried. y’know? I am not a crying kind of guy.
I would be sad sure, but i would not cry.
cry?! i just found a talking puppy, I am rich!
oh, that is parent’s day, first grade. that is me with the janitor martin.
oh they did not want to come!
no! look, i do not cry! it is not a big deal! okay?!
you did not get more movies that are going to have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
phoebe buffay in buffay: the vampire layer.
hey, i had a terrible childhood and i do not do porn.
her ankle is what you are watching?
she is just doing her job!
hey! (he quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
there is no back to this couch!
yeah i know, but i figured a shot y’know? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you would not think i was y’know, all dead inside.
oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
no, i mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we are up at the altar and I am like this. (makes a bored face.)
yeah?
okay, well i will not uh, worry about this anymore then.
aww, i love you so…
what?!
so you did not mean any of that?!
hey.
(to monica) maybe we should give them some privacy.
(crying hysterically) i just do not see why those two can not work things out!
(starts crying) i-i can not believe jill’s gone. (they all look at him.) i can not help it, i opened a gate.
hey!
I have got nowhere to go this morning. I am unemployed! i do not know what I am going to do with my life.
i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself?
but it is all so overwhelming. i do not know where to start.
hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
how long was i in there?
wait. advertising! that is a great idea!
i do not think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? "cheese. it is milk that you chew." "crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy." "a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
honey? leave it to the pros.
"the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
no, no. but let me show you what i can do. "bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."
really? that is great!
it is funny. when you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
actually, we are trying, and i do not think monica's going to want to postpone it. we are supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she is probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now.
whatever i decide to do, I am going to be starting a career from scratch. it is going to be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
yeah.
yeah, ross is here so...
hey.
oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we will all be wearing silver jump suits.
oh god, i have to tell you something. you are not pregnant.
that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it.
oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises.
that is actually why. look, I am starting a whole new career now, and I am not saying that i do not want to have a baby, I am just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
or a year?
it could be less than a year. i mean, you have heard my stuff. "pants. like shorts, but longer." (pause) it will probably be more than a year.
yeah, me too. look, I will just get my old job back.
i quit and you learn what i do?
i guess. it is always going to be scary when we have a baby.
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time.
taste it.
yeah, i know, i did that two minutes ago.
hey, mister tux!
(entering from bathroom, with an issue of cosmo) all right, i took the quiz, and it turns out, i do put career before men. (to joey) get up.
you are in my seat.
because i was sitting there.
well, it is not like i went to spain. i went to the bathroom, you knew i was coming back.
the big deal is i was sitting there last, so, that is my seat.
all right, ross, i just have to do one thing, really quickly, it is not a big deal. (yells at joey) get up!!
well, joey, i wrote a little song today. it is called: get up.
really!
honey, you did call him back. because, it is, it is really old.
you know what, okay, fine. do not get up, you just sit right there. i just hope, you do not mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of joey's face) op, not touching, can not get mad! not touching can not get mad! not touching can not get mad! (joey flings some dip onto phoebe's dress)
maybe he is calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
all right, fine, you know what, we will both sit in the chair. (sits on joey's lap) I am soooo, comfortable.
all right! (jumps up)
all right! fine! I am going. but when i get back it is chair sitting, and I am the guy who is....sitting in a chair! (leaves)
maybe it was his sister's. you know, maybe it was his daughter's.
all right, you will notice that i am fully dressed. i, in turn, have noticed that you are not. so in the words of a. a. milne, "get out of my chair, dillhole!"
what are you doing?
the cushions are the essence of the chair!
oh-ho, it will be back. oh-ho, there is nobody in the room.
we used them as pillows when we went camping.
(shyly) the sheep.
he took my essence!
well, then it looks like somebody is going to have to give back somebody his cushions.
what are you, what are you going to show me my clothes?
he is got nothing!
what are you supporting?
monica, i think you have gone over to the bad place.
(to phoebe) you know what is weird. donald duck never wore pants. but whenever he is getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. i mean, what is that about?
they got a phone in there, right?
is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that?
oh my god! that is so not the opposite of taking somebody is underwear!!
oooo-ooh!
jeez, what a baby.
stop it. stop it!
excuse me. hi.
well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
i mean, i was sitting there.
but, i never left the room!
all right, that is it, give me your underwear.
yea yea. (pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
no, no, ross and rachel will be back soon and then i got to go to the office (pulls another balloon out of his mouth) am i producing them?
could not sleep last night you know, then i started worrying about this big divisional meeting that i have later today, the more i worried about it the more i could not sleep.  y’know? i was like, if i fall asleep now I will get six hours sleep, but if i fall asleep now I will get five hours sleep. not matter what i did i could not fall asleep.
hey, what do i know? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
walter (nods).
yep.
(not knowing what he is saying yes to) yes.
(enters) hey.
monica can i talk to you outside for a minute?
actually pheebs its more of a husband and wife kind of thing
umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to paris for a year? you know, you could study french cooking and i could write and we could take a picnic along the seine and go wine tasting in bordeaux?
okay, you know how that people say that tulsa is the paris of oklahoma?
people who have never ever been to paris.
we are moving to tulsa! (makes a excited expression on his face)
okay, ms. mckenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to tulsa and be the president of our office there, and i was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
the sooner state, whatever that is.
really? oh what a beautiful morning!  surrey with a fringe on top.
no, no, but they are going to lease us a ford focus. (monica’s not impressed.) I will get out of it.
(hears emma crying) what is wrong with emma?
umm madam, do you have a minute? (she points for him to come in) i kind of have some bad news. i do not think i can move to tulsa.
it is a funny story, actually. (coughs) i kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when i said I would move to tulsa, i did not really know what i was saying.
but only because i was up all night worried about this meeting, are not that funny? irony? not a fan, alright (he sits down). see, here is the thing. i went home and told my wife about tulsa and she will not go. see, me, i love tulsa!  tulsa is heaven!  tulsa is italy—please do not make me go there!
no no no! look, carol, can i call you carol? (pause) wh-why would i when your name is elaine? oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (she glares at him.) that is a picture of your daughter, is not it, well she is lovely. i like a girl with a strong jaw. I will call you from tulsa. (exits.)
(entering, loudly) hey!
oh so there can not be any yelling.
we are moving to tulsa
shhhh! shhhhh! shhhhh! shhhhh! (walks backwards towards the door) i can not, i can not hear you. (he runs out)
(enters) hey, what you guys talking about?
oh! look at that, time's up! my turn!
it is your timer.
all right, then massage me up right nice!
ah! ahh!! ahh!!
it is so good i do not know what I have done to deserve it!
good-bye muscles!!
I am telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. and i wanted to give it up i just—i did not know what it was!
look, for the first time in my life I am in a real relationship. okay, I am not going to screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
(examining the hat) and the bunny got away. (turns and starts looking for the bunny as joey puts the hat on.)
and you are going to make them all disappear.
done.
hey.
hey!
wow! you look just like your son mrs. tribbiani!
pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
oh my god!
and a date with a man!
(wincing) yes, he is!
I am sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
hey, is rachel here?
(coming all the way in) listen, i just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. y'know? i-i really like  them.
(falling into that trap) i do not like your massages.
okay, but now see you are crying!
what?
it is okay, you do not have to be the best at everything.
okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
okay, hear me out. okay? you give the best bad massages. if anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "who is the best of that?" they would have to go to you.
oh, it would be you! you! monica! and you would get all the votes!
absolutely!
yeah! (they hug.)
hey man, how did the audition go?
oh my god!
oh, hey! (ross nods in agreement as well.)
yeah umm, they are called wallets.
or... dick.
was it like a sneeze only better?
no!!
whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) huh.
no, it is... fancier than a pimple. look ross, why do not you just go see a…
okay, well, it is definite, two more weeks of winter.
hey!
well, y'know if joey and i played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
you are right, i know.
(joining them) okay, how did it go at the doctor's?
y'know what? you should go to my guy, because when i went in there with my third nipple. he just lopped it right off. y'know? so i guess I am lucky. i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
well, if he is going to break up with you, maybe joey and i should water his plants. if y'know what i mean.
well sensitive is important, pick him.
(sitting down on the couch) i-kea! this is comfortable.
so, what do you thing the good news is?
yes, but this is pete. okay? he is not like other people, on your first date he took you to rome. for most guys that is like a third or fourth date kind of thing.
oh, so you are going with the teacher, huh?
(comforting the duck) everything’s going to be all right. okay, dick?
(entering) hey monica, here is your broom back.
oh hey, how did the interview go?
so what happened?
well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
come on, rach.
i got to check out this hot girl! (he heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at monica.) there she is! (he dances over to her and kisses her.)
(to gary) so what do you say, maybe sometime i hold your gun?
oh, what can happen? i mean, would you… (he gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
uh, yeah.
why?
ohh, so?
monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! okay? it is crazy. {finally! the voice of reason.} i mean, just impress gary and phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I am saying no to this, why? get your coat.
that was amazing!
that was amazing.
no, you are the best.
no, you are the best.
honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
oh yeah, it is so cool. (he opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) now i got to go, officer bing has got to, 10-100. (pause, softly) that is pee-pee. (heads for the bathroom.)
monica! this is the men's room! (pause) is not it?
no. and if i did, i do not think we would be going out. monica, this is getting ridiculous!
ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
(gasps) so?
oh wow! is that what this all have been about?
yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, I am more excited about where we are right now.
yeah! I have never been in a relationship that is lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that is pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that is pretty exciting. (kisses her.)
yeah?
y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship.
yes you did! admit it! you freaked out!
little?! you freaked out big time! okay? and i fixed it! we have switched places! i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (does a dance of joy.) (monica glares at him.) and now we are back.
(entering) you guys ready fore the movies?
this is unbelievable. it is been like a half an hour. if this was a cartoon, you would be looking like a ham right about now.
it is phoebe! hi!
wait, wait! wh-what are you doing here?
can we start over?
all right, now look at her and tell me she does not look exactly like her sister.
they are twins!
you know that thing, when you and i talk to each other about things?
let us not do that any more.
your sister ursula.
yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
oh, you do? because she said you guys have not talked in like years.
oh, and I have got earth science, but I will catch you in gym.
and (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, helen.
oh, okay. send her in.
hi, nina. come on in.
uh, yes. yes. I have just been going over your data here, and little thing, you have been post-dating your friday numbers.
well, it throws my wenus out of whack.
wenus. (coughs) weekly estimated net...
it is not just that she is cute, okay. it is just that... she is really really cute.
(looking out at the balcony) so tell me something, is leaving the christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
hey, where you been?
score.
yeah, listen. okay, before you do anything joey-like, you might want to run it by err... (he indicates phoebe, who is helping ross understand the remote control.)
mr. d, how is it going, sir?
and?
so what does this mean?
hey, listen, i know i came in late last week, but i slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
nina? nina. (he goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) nina. (in pain) nina.
(looking down at her hand) yes, yes i am. err, listen, the reason that i called you in here today was, err... please do not hate me.
(suddenly bright) would you like to have dinner sometime?
well, you still have not taken down the christmas lights.
I am just trying to find the right moment, you know?
you know, once you are inside, you do not have to knock any more.
wow, this is serious. I have never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
knit, good woman, knit, knit!
and that is the chrysler building right there.
yes, yes she is. did not i memo you on this? see, after i let her go, err, i got a call from her psychiatrist, dr. flanen-nen, dr. flanen, dr. flan.
and err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
oh, no, no. nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! in fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
and yet, believable. so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
well, i guess that is why they call it psychology, sir.
you know, ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
ah, sure, nina. what is up?
oh, well, ah... maybe that is because they are ah... jealous, of us.
ah, well, maybe that is, ah, because you are getting a big raise.
sure, why not?
oh, you do not know. (presses a button.) helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on miss bookbinder’s raise?
helen drinks. (insincerely) will you marry me?
well, i ended up telling her everything.
pretty well. except for the stapler thing. (he holds up a bandaged hand.) little tip: if you are ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
you are not going to lose him.
wait. before we go in, i just want you to know i love you. i had a great time on our honeymoon, and i can not wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
they are terrific, and they live right here in the city.
I am sorry, we are just kind of excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
listen, they are really great. if you just got a chance…
we really…did not get a chance to…
ross! it is got your wavy black lines!
y’know who has a great video camera?
let us call ‘them.
here you go. (shows her the number again.)
what?
i do not know! you were a delight to talk to. you asked all those insightful, great questions.
yeah, we are going to need to see that tape. (they rest of them agree.)
i still do not get it, we did not do anything wrong.
i thought you said those jokes were funny. joke! joke! joke!
well maybe it was all of your questions.
the sheer volume, it was like flying with the riddler!
(angrily) was that another question?
did you do it on our invitations?!
so, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
that is the magic story you use when you want to have sex!
jenny! that is so jenny!
hi!
how come?
do you have any ideas?
(imitating monica) oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? monica!
oh, well... maybe I will join them some time. i just hope the club does not slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt? medical malpractice? choked on his own moustache?
mmm that is enough about you!
no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we are not together. we are not a couple. we are definately not a couple.
we are not going to have this conversation again... look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man! (laughs) you do not think he is here, do you? (joey looks around)
(chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by richard's video collection) look at these videos. you know, i mean, who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my god!
there is a tape here with monica's name on it.
get there faster! (joey gasps and finally understands...)
I am not going to watch it... i do not need to watch it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) well, we know I am going to watch it. (chandler moves to put the tape in the vcr and joey enters the apartment)
do not judge me, I am only human!
i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... would not you need to know what was on it?
some girl...!?
yeah...!?
allright, I am going to watch it... i mean look, it is probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can not possibly be as bad as what I am picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) can it?
then you are going to have to watch it for me.
just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please?
why am i hearing cheering?
football? just football?
it is football... it is just football... this is great! this is the first time I have ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to get a beer... (chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the tv and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... joey's eyes double in size...) what the... (chandler turns around, but joey already took a sprint for chandler, jumps, and floors chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) what are you doing?
whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star!
because that is who i am, okay? I am sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it would not bother him. just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
this is about you and richard. he is clearly not over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache!
yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
oh, good, good. play more, because i want to see how it ends.
what...? that is not you! life is good again! ride  them cowgirl!
is that a problem?
you do not have to stop having fun just because I am here. kathy did not cheat on all of you. (to joey) well, except you. (they hug and chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) would you give me one minute!! please.
y’know, i can not believe kathy did this too me. i really, thought that she was the one. i tell you what, from now on I am never getting out of this chair, ever! okay? from now on, this chair is the one! you want to what else is the one? my sweat pants!
that is right! where are the guys? I am ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
they got a breakfast buffet.
ooh, let me talk to him!
well, can i just…
she is shhing me! it is my phone and she is shhing me!
ow!
maybe, she does not hit him all the time.
okay, I am going to go stand over there. (points and moves into the living room.)
so y’know, uh, when is he getting back?
y’know, i knew something like this was going to happen. (he starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
yes you can. you are thinking about time, you can not go back in time.
(laughs) no you can not.
you do not want to be guys, you would be all hairy and would not live as long. (starts to go to his bedroom)
okay. (starts to cry)
no thanks, mom!
ahh, come on! y’know what—y’know what, i think I am just going to go home and call kathy.
no! that was a test! in a couple of hours I am going to get really drunk and want to call kathy and you guys are going to have to stop me! and then after that, I am going to get so drunk, I am going to want to call janice
ohhh!!
oh yeah, that was great. thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
all right, well I am going to put my sweats back on.
yeah?
stripping!
okay, look, I am going to have to ask you all to leave.
look, forget it. we tried, but phase three is a lost because, okay? those strippers were insanely hot, and i could not picture myself with any of them. (sits back in disgust.)
(jumping up) phase three! i just achieved phase three!
i am totally picturing you with all those women!
well, I am there too!
stop it! you are killing me! i think i just moved on to phase four!
where i do not want to have a relationship ever! i just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
come on, let me see that smile.
please?
i know, i know, but you are going to have plenty of chances. there are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
all right ladies, here is what we are going to do. (points to a stripper.) you are going to take off my clothes. (to another two strippers) you two, go get the oils. (to another stripper) and you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "chandler’s the king! chandler’s the king!"
oh, that is fine! go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
come on! would you please pay attention, i could wake up at any moment!
what do you want from me, I have never met the guy. so anyway, rachel, I am sorry you can not stay, (rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (the cigarette guy starts rubbing chandler’s back.) what are you doing? (the guy just nods) all right, listen, I have got to wake up!
this is the new york times.
we are. he is meeting us here.
yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something.
y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross does not try to kidnap me after cub scouts.
y'know what maybe it is going to be okay, i mean it is been a week.
no.
yes, yes, it is just that we ah, we kind of all ready, made plans with ross.
yeah, he is really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
(jumps back and points at the cigarette) oh my god!
well, actually, yesterday i was smoking again. today, I am, I am smoking still.
look, I am telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when i started smoking in the first place.
yeahhh. I am tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
oh that is great, with my luck, that is going to be him.
nope, hymn 253, his eyes are on the sparrow! when my parents got divorced is when i started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it is rachel again.)
hey, shut up!! you are not my real mom!!
can somebody else hug him? i have to stay by the window.
well, then, i might as well offer to stay.
(to joey) well he is probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
what?
beam me up jesus.
okay, well, then, i-i have to go to the bathroom.
oh, come on, there is a rest stop right up there! come on, i really have to goooooooooo.
here we go. okay, brace yourselves.
oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
(to joey) my lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)
damn! (stands up) the tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
oh i do! op, no, wait a minute, i took it out of my shirt when i put it on this morning.
ladies, ladies, let us just compromise okay? phoebe, rachel take off monica’s bra.
well, i thought if i littered, that crying indian might come by and save us.
okay, now let us decide who has the nicest ass.
at least let me smoke it to the good part.
i have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
well it is very unsettling.
oh no, now it is not going to make any sense!
oh, this is horrible, it is just horrible.
it is horrible.
y'know what, i can handle it, handle’s my middle name. actually it is the ah, middle part of my first name.
guys, guys, guess who i am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
i was being shelly winters from the poseidon adventure.
(coming from the bedroom) say goodbye elves, I am off to tulsa.
yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i do not get it done, I will be fired.
so, who does?
I am sorry, i will not be here.
thanks. (they kiss) I will see you new year's day.
did i not mention that?
(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) and to all a good night! (and runs out of the apartment)
all right everybody, i know that it is christmas eve and you would rather be with your families, but there is *no* call (he takes it off) for writing "screw you, mr. bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- by the way, you can all call me chandler.
hey. where have you been?
(to the others) you hear that? you may not be with your families, but at least it is going to smell like ham in here.
y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told  them about all the hard work you have been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order.
well, that is like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!
I am sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
haha, no thanks!
oh, thanks! I am... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional...
i can save you time ladies, I am right here.
what? that is terrible!
oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
no not okay, you can not look for monica's presents!
no, you do not have to, and you can not because i, i live here too.
why?
no, i have a great idea for a present for her.
if i help, we can find  them faster!
ok, pheebs, your turn.
and, a lemon lime.
and last but not least.
(entering in a santa costume) ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!
hey! (grunts as ben hits him at full speed.)
well, I am here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
what?
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!
why?
but i did not get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
fine, I will give the suit back.
santa? really?
did your dad ever dress up like santa?
then it is okaaay! (they kiss.)
you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your families. it is bad enough that we are working new year's eve.
did i not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- alright, look, go! go home, okay? merry christmas! go.
good, god's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees wendy) you are not going to go?
ah. thanks.
ah. (the phone rings; he answers it) chandler bing.
ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!
ah, well no, it is just uh, me and wendy.
it is. did i... not tell you about her?
i sent them home.
uhh, uh...
i do not know!
i do not think of her that way, you know, she is a, she is a colleague.
oh, she is regional vice president; she is... just below me.
be-low me!
well, she... she did not win...
well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she is probably...
honey, there is really nothing to worry about.
I am serious!
merry christmas.
merry christmas, you guys!
(hanging up the phone) the wife says "hi!".
ah well, she is got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is going to happen.
this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you are getting ham on my only tie.
whoa-ho, back off, missy! (he takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
i do not know; I am not used to girls making passes at me! ... (she let us go of his tie) wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?
(flattered) no,... no... (realizing) no! (he quickly gets several steps away from her.) look, I am, I am married!
I am *happily* married.
right. so, I am sorry...
well look, it is not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she is entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... you know, she is amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she would kick your ass. look, you are a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever going to happen between us.
i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
you kidding? you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what is going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?
but we do not do that.
how drunk are you?
(thinks) that is the perfect amount!
what?
i know.
well, i have kissed over four women. (they kiss again.) do you want to get under the covers?
okay!
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
yep!
count of three?
two!
well i think it is safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
eh! (they start making out again)
so, are you really going to go out with that nurse man?
y'know, i do not know if you have ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this.
really? okay, so...
y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we are okay?
right!
okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! (picks up a blue sweater.) okay, here is something, here is something blue and new.
let us go! (starts to leave.)
oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that I have had since i was twelve.
i do not think so.
(looks around) here just...take this. (hands her the sweater.)
no, we will-we will bring it back! just put it under your dress.
okay, one thing at a time. (they run out to get married.)
ehh.
look, i thought about it too, and I am sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
yeah, I am putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that is what we are going to do.
eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we will pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
yeah.
uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
well, stuff like where we would live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we would have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.
sure you do.
you sure?
i love you so much.
hey!
i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much.
monica.
i never want to leave you again!
turns out they can not fire me. because i quit.
yeah! it is a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who does not get to do what he *really* wants to do?
(realizing) i have *not* thought this through!
i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it.
thanks!
(flattered) ahh...
(to monica) here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys.
i do not have a *job*!
actuary... no. book-keeper... no. topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to monica:) hey, d'you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner. *you* are the head of the household. i do not do anything - I am a kept man!
all right joey, be nice.  so does he have a hump? a hump and a hairpiece?
sounds like a date to me.
alright, so I am back in high school, I am standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and i realize i am totally naked.
then i look down, and i realize there is a phone... there.
that is right.
all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. now i do not know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
finally, i figure I would better answer it, and it turns out it is my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
cookie?
sometimes i wish i was a lesbian... (they all stare at him.) did i say that out loud?
and i just want a million dollars! (he extends his hand hopefully.)
(imitating the characters) tuna or egg salad?  decide!
(re tv) ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
please do not do that again, it is a horrible sound.
ooh, this is a dear diary moment.
I am sorry, i did not catch your name. paul, was it?
(deadpan) yes, and we are very excited about it.
it is a beautiful thing.
i would have to say that is an 'l'-shaped bracket.
i have no idea.
all finished!
yes, please do not spoil all this fun.
oh, god.
oh my god!
you must stop! (chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
look, ross, you got to understand, between us we have not had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento.   you, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we do not do it!  i do not think that was my point!
stay out of my freezer! [scene: a restaurant, monica and paul are still eating.]
angela's the screamer, andrea has cats.
that is amazing.
if can invade poland, there is not anything i can not do.
hi, paul, is it?
all right, kids, i got to get to work. if i do not input those numbers,... it does not make much of a difference...
'look, gippetto, I am a real live boy.'
you are right, I am sorry. (burst into song and dances out of the door.) "once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
and yet you are surprisingly upbeat.
oh, how well you know me...
(as rachel is cutting up her cards) y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
did you make it, or are you just serving it?
kids, new dream... I am in las vegas. (rachel sits down to hear chandler's dream.)
okay, so, I am in las vegas... I am liza minelli-
(entering) hey!
(to phoebe) is that joey?! (she nods yes) let me talk to him!
(to phoebe) y'know what? i have been trying to apologize to him all week! if he is not going to let me do it on the phone, I am going to go down there and do it in person.
(to joey) hey!
no-no-no-no, I have supported you one hundred percent and i want to prove that to you in person!
forgive me? you have not been taking my calls in a week!
uh, what was that?
(entering) hey!
i know. can you believe it? one year ago today i was just your annoying friend chandler.
huh.
oh, but it is not 'til tomorrow!
okay.
wow!
do we have to?
okay this is great, but joey said he did not want any of us out there.
yeah, i think we should see other people.
yes.
it is a great idea. (they kiss)
y'know pheebs, it is kind of our (his and monica's) anniversary.
(coughing) art lover!
i said art lover.
i do not know, I am very tired.
so it is pretty much the same pheebs.
yeah, i guess it is a little better now.
(to monica) happy plane-aversary.
can i give you a present now?
okay! (he grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) oh man! do not tell me i did this!
how do you feel about the, "i really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
ohh that is the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
what-what richard thing?
what richard thing?
(talking out of the side of his mouth) I am not mad.
oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! it is no big deal. (he still are not happy.)
oh my god.
love your condoms my man.
why?! what happened?!
no-no, that is okay, apparently there is a new policy where we do not have to share everything with everybody.
no! her boyfriend richard!
when you go lunching with hunky moustache men and do not tell me about it!
thanks. (they hug.)
(pushing her away from another hug) next time?
there is not going to be a next time! you can not ever see him again!
that is so funny, because i think i just did!
fine with me!
what are you talking…
really?
(interrupting in the nick of time) joey, i uh! i can not believe this is how I am spending my anniversary.
whoa!
y'know, if i won $5,000 I would join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit richard from behind with a stick! (mimics it.)
good luck!
i see.
(totally confused) what?
what is an identical hand twin?
are you sure you were not (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
(totally confused) how?
again i must go back to, how?
(pause) y'know, i-i can not really put a price on that joe.
no! no! i support you 100%! i just did not, i did not get it right away. y'know now I am caught up! identical hand twins! it is a million-dollar idea!
no!
that was joey!
yeah, well, she is probably talking to richard.
really?
okay. (he gets up and goes to find her.)
(walking by with his luggage) see you later mon.
what does it look like? I am going home.
come on! i was there! (he is propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. he winces and pulls his hand away.) i know he is the love of your life.
really?!
yeah, i wanted to make a dramatic scene, but i hate packing.
(arm-in-arm with monica) hey pheebs!
yeah, she could not live without the chan love. (they start kissing.)
yes! I have-I have never seen a roll like this in my life!
okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. ah, a 6?
8. 8!
if you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
noo!
ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
two fours.
thank you, mister drunken gambler! okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (everyone cheers) wait-wait-wait-wait! we (motions to monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the place.
(sees the roll) yes!! i love you! i can not even remember what we were fighting about!
another hard 8.
okay, okay, i tell you what. you roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.
you roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
yes! i love you! I have never loved anybody as much as i love you.
okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {whoa! where have i heard that before? matthew perry talking about signs in las vegas. i guess it must have been some movie i saw.} what do you say?
okay! come on! let us go! all right!
(spots one) okay! that is a four! and where-where is the other one?
all right!
here it is! here it is!
it is a four.
okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! (picks up a blue sweater.) okay, here is something, here is something blue and new.
let us go! (starts to leave.)
ohh, great, i have condom in my wallet I have had since i was twelve.
i do not think so.
(looks around) here just…take this. (hands her the sweater.)
no, we will-we will bring it back! just put it under your dress.
okay, one thing at a time. (they run out to get married.)
hello! one marriage please!
(singing) dum! dum-dum-dum! dum! dum! dum! dum-dum-dum!
oh, that is the wedding march. does, does that freak you out?
okay! (stands up) this is it! (claps his hands) we are going to get married!
i missed most of the party (pause) charlie's a girl, right?
(to joey) so, a professor, uh?
oh, yeah?
oh, well... maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites monica to have sex on it)
we really need to take those tests?
but i do not want to do it in a cup!
it is weird! in a doctor's office?
(embarrassed) i cannot believe ross told you that! (pause) and in my defense, it was a wendy's!
yeah, ok. I am sure that doctor's office can not be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory!
oh, yeah! rachel talks too!
i have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) how do i know that they are not going to secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
deposit my specimen? you know, usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. thanks, got it.
yeah, i guess!
oh, come on!
why are you here?
(to heaven) no no no... i mean, why? why is she here??
what!?
I would love to stay, but i have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
(disgusted) i think it just fell off. (leaves)
(to the nurse at the nurses' station) my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees janice is still there) janice! you are not... gone?
yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!
i have not... i have not even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was going to be ok.
(slightly panicky) yeah, but what if it is not? what if there is a reason why we can not have a baby?
(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can not believe i did not even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
(stares at her intently, then yells) it was a "wendy's!! "
(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) it is not okay that I am aroused by this now.
hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. (pause) no, she is not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) oh. (pause) well, so what does that mean? (pause) ok. ok, thank you. thanks. (hangs up)
doctor connelly just called.
actually it is both of us.
apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
it means that my guys will not get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) it means...
(seriously) it means that we can keep trying, but there is a good chance this may never happen for us.
I am sorry.
well, we are going to... we are going to figure this out.
hey.
y’know uh, i did not actually do this.
no, it was not you.
i got a maid. yay!
uh honey, i know you do not like to relinquish control…
look, she is really nice. okay? and she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
yes, i distinctly remember ‘because i thought it was a joke. now just give her a chance, okay?
what is the matter?
see? i told you.
(pause) what?
so she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
she must have been planning this for years!
honey, is not it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
so, should not we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?
out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
(entering) hi!
how come?
to see her pants?
are you sure? did you see the stain?
god! she is not stealing from us! okay, will you let this go?
oh dear god!
and yet you do not recognize that you are crazy.
here is another plan…no!
why?
i fear a jury will see it the same way!
you see that?
all right. yes. okay. i get your point. but if it is not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
you need new clothes.
I am leaning. this is where i lean.
brenda a bee!
yes! it is flown into your blouse and you would better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
you do?
i totally understand. (they both laugh.) can i just see your bra?
(entering) hey!
hey-hey-hey. so what happened? a forest tick you off?
yeah!
you are building a post office?
okay. (notices that joey is wearing some really tight jeans) my word! those are snug.
does anyone else think david copperfield is cute?
all right, janice, likes him. in fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can not get mad.
ah, kim basinger, cindy crawford, halle berry, yasmine bleeth, and ah, jessica rabbit.
i know, i know, i just always wondered if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
peter parker.
(coughing) what a geek!
hi.
we do not, really.
you know, we do not really take advantage of living in the city.
no, you did not get me!! it is an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
i do not want this unit!!
fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)
all right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
eh, y'know what, she is to political, she probably would not let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
ooh-hoo. very hot, very sexy. but ah, y'know she is too international, y'know she is never going to be around.
so, you got to play the odds, pick somebody who is going to be in the country like all the time.
(entering) have you seen joey?
oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) y’know what it is my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
what is going on?
yo!! spackel boy! get up!
he started mine first!
what, like a number?
hi! bye! (runs to the bathroom)
okay, on three. one....two....
why two?
yeah, i coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.
okay, one...two...
oh, good job joe.
yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
yeah, y'know what i got a better idea. how-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it does not move.)
umm?
I have got five bucks says you can not.
oh, i think i have the cash.
yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors will not open) I am out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) here you go.
oh, great. this is just...
oh my god, it is that victoria's secret model. something... something goodacre.
she is right, it is jill. jill goodacre. oh my god. i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! (pause) is it a vestibule? maybe it is an atrium. oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
jill says vestibule... I am going with vestibule.
oh! some guy. some guy. 'hey jill, i saw you with some guy last night. yes, he was some guy.
alright, alright, alright. it is been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. oh god, do something. just make contact, smile!
there you go!
you are definitely scaring here.
yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with. yeah, thanks. (takes phone)
hey, it is me.
yeah, I am fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I am trppd in an atm vstbl wth jll gdcr.
I am trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr!
(angry) put joey on the phone.
I am trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr.
yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
um, is it sugarless?
oh, then no thanks. what the hell was that? mental note: if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it. if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'gum would be perfection'? 'gum would be perfection.' could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I will have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. for me, gum is perfection. i loathe myself.
(chewing gum) ah, let us see. what next? blow a bubble. a bubble's good. it is got a... boyish charm, it is impish. here we go.
nice going, imp. ok, it is ok. all i need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
good save! we are back on track, and I am... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. this is not my gum. oh my god! oh my god! and now you are choking.
(gasping) yes... thank you. that was... that was....
ok.
yes. yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
hi, um, I am account number 7143457. and, uh, i do not know if you got any of that, but i would really like a copy of the tape.
yeah, it was time. the old condom ring in the leather just does not say ‘cool’ anymore.
oh yeah, gym member. i try to go four times a week, but I have missed the last 1200 times.
you do not think I have tried? you think i like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? no, they make you go all the way down there! then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! then they bring out maria.
oh maria. you can not say no to her, she is like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
no!
oh no, you will have to come.
why do not you just give him to somebody else?
because that is the only part of you he can see when he is on the table!
yes. (in a stronger voice) yes!
no! i want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
okay. (they go inside) (to the guy at the desk) i want to quit the gym.
i want to quit the gym.
(he turns to ross and ross makes a ‘be strong’ sound.) i want to quit the gym.
(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) i want to quit the gym.
hey.
no, i almost did, could not leave ross there without a spotter!
we are doomed. okay, they are going to take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. what are we going to do?
you are a genius!
now, there is two reasons.
thank you, joey.
hi.
no, we would just like to close them.
i want to quit the bank!
to pay for the gym.
hey.
yeah… bunny-rabbit.
oh my goodness! where did you hide it?
pheebs you did not have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
oh, okay.
i kind of like it here.
well what did it do?
a vending machine?
who cares? it is a stupid game.
i do not suck. it is sucks. you suck.
why do you want to play this game so bad?
you are not going to believe what i did today!
i got good. i played this game all day and now i rule at it! they should change the name of it to ms. chandler. (pause) although i-i hope they do not.
uh-huh, and i got all the top ten scores, i erased phoebe off the board! high five! (holds up his hand to give monica a high five, only he can not straighten his fingers.)
well I have been playing it for like eight hours, it will loosen up. come on, check out the scores. oh, and also look at the initials, they are dirty words.
because it is awesome.
well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after a-s-s it is a bit of a challenge.
it is when you put it together with that one.
come on, he will not even know what they mean.
have you talked to him lately?
no-no-no, if you unplug it, I will have nothing to show for my day! it would be like i was at work. (she unplugs it.) no! (and plugs it back in.) hey look at that! look at that, it is still there! this thing must have some kind of primitive rom (read only memory, it is a memory chip.) chip in it or something!
with the claw?!
(smiles) pull my finger—(looks at his hand)—my hand is messed up.
i did. (looks at his still deformed hand) but it came at a price.
oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (they both look at him.) was it just me?!
one more score to go! you can do it! (touches her shoulder.)
all right! go left! go left! go right!! go right!!
did you see our bank statement? can this be right?
I am not sure what they did, but I am inclined to blame enron.
maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
you know what? you know what? i think we are making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change. you are chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
no! we are not borrowing money.
because we do not do that. we are bings! and if there is one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
that is right! i do! and I am your man. and I am going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
yeah.... she is not so cute.
yes dear.
hey joe!
listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can not tell monica anything about it.
and that would have made the official party line. (joey nods) monica and i are having a little financial trouble.
what? what do you mean you know?
oh! right.
anyway, err... i need to borrow some money.
yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! (joey begins writing a cheque)
oh ok.
i can not believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?
what?
what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she would not tell me about?
hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.
oh no..do not thank me. thank you. you know there is not one thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not... two... single things.
no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for your form.
well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i would not change it. at all. and more specifically, i would not want anything to get any bigger.
i mean, you would not want any part of me to get any bigger would you? do not answer that.
hey rach! ah........ perfection. (kisses monica) would not change a thing. not a thing.
yeah?
but honey you do not have to.
honey i... i love your breasts the way they are!
your ass?!?!?
they...do that?
god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?
(sedated) what?
well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
aaaaand....... hernia.
ah, look on the bright side, i mean you will not have to live with this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you. (they hug again)
okay! (stands up) this is it! (claps his hands) we are going to get married!
oh my god!
oh my god!! is everybody getting married?!!
hey!
yes! well that-yes.
we actually missed it.
what?!
hi!
so, has anyone talked to dr. and mrs. geller yet?
it is a buffet man.
listen, i got to talk to you.
monica and i almost got married last night.
look, i just do not think monica and i are ready to get married yet! y’know? i mean, i love her and everything but seeing ross and rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that monica and i are moving so fast. y’know? and, how do i tell her without crushing her?
what?!
(returning with joey) hi.
hey!
are we going to talk about what you guys did last night? or…
(not quite sure) you did.
well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this one’s free, right? because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.
i do not know. but i-i-i know i love you!
so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? i love you.
yes, we do not get married unless there is a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there is a definite sign that we should get married.
sounds great.
ready!
(deadpan) yes, yes eight.
that was so unlikely. well, let us get married! i guess.
that is right! it was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! damnit!
yeah. (they go pack.) we are doing the right thing, right?
well you did pull his hair.
I am not getting into this again!
 well, i told you not to walk. here. (picks her up.) there. okay. (he opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and let us go of monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
no!
all right, should we just, should we just get married? y’know? i mean should we just do it? all the signs are telling us to do it.
me too!
no!
jeez, relax! it is not like we are mar-ah-ah!! (runs out.)
(entering, slowly) y’know i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here?
well, what if all my stuff was here?
okay. what if we lived together and you understand what I am saying?
me asking is kind of a sign.
okay!!!!!
okay.
oh thanks.
the door has not been locked in five years, but okay! (runs out.) ready?!
okay, a little problem. the key broke in the lock and i can not get in!
this is not a sign!
it is an old key!
i love you!
are you hugging the door right now.
yeah-yeah, me neither.
the key’s stuck in the lock.
(trying the handle) it still does not work.
oh.
nice job joe! you are quite the craftsmen.
hey.
I am so sorry.
i have a job interview i have to get ready for.
and people say you do not pay attention. no, this is a much better job. it is vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
that is what i do now.
the front page? you really do live in your own little world, do not ya?
(entering) hey phoebe! (to rachel) fatty!
well, i got a job interview. it is kind of a big deal too. its a lot more money and I would be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
me! i do that. so… seriously, do i look okay? I am little nervous.
why not?
what about it?
(shocked) what?!
are you serious?!
what is it that i do?
(to rachel) did you like me when we first met?
i can not even believe this! i really come off that badly?
oh good. good, because I am sure this interview is going to last a couple of weeks.
an hour.
phoebe!
chandler bing.
well you should meet my uncle, bada. (pause) I will let myself out.
…i think you will find if i come to work here, i do not micro-manage. i do not shy away from delegating.
(suppressing a smile) what i do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
hardest thing I have ever done in my life.
oh! (stands up.)
really?
okay.
…also i was the point person on my company’s transition from the kl-5 to gr-6 system.
that i did. that i did.
(nervous) my duties? (trying not to crack a joke) all right.
(trying not to laugh) i see.
(really try not to laugh) good to know.
no do not i beg of you!
(relieved) really?!
yeah i got to say thank you, i was really nervous. y’know I have been told i come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (the interviewer does not understand) duties. (still does not.) duties! (still does not.) poo. (still does not.)
oh my god this does not count! okay? the interview was over, that was the real chandler bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! call security! there is a crazy guy out in the hall!
I will look forward to your call. (walks away.)
treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
hey!
do we pay for this?
maybe we should not pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
yeah, joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
like finding money with naked people on it!
we do not know what could make this go away.
and no one touches the air around the tv!
we still have porn.
or a job where you do not have to carry a table.
it is the theme from good will humping.
oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
they do not really talk to us about that kind of stuff. i can get you some free white out though.
whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
all right look, forget it, forget it. you told her you love her, it is over.
what?
okay. (pause) good one.
hi! listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? we need a porn break. we spent the last two hours watching in & out & in, again.
because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
pregnant woman slays four?
what is the second part of your plan?
you put your fist through the wall?
a place where no one will ever get out alive?
are we in london?
hey.
i was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she did not ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
what, no, "nice apartment, i bet the bedrooms are huge?"
y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
all right, ready?
two.
yeah, that is kind of a relief.
you want to see if we still have it?
free porn!!!
we have free porn here!!!
how did the job stuff go?
or facing a bitch of a commute.
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (monica looks at him and can not really place what he just said)
well, it makes me feel sad, but...
i see.
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we are easily confused. we are not very bright.
what do you think pheebs?
yeah.
you are kidding!
oh yeah?
i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic.
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we are okay.
it feels like we are cheating on our house. and if we are going to cheat, should not it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house will not do?
and yet i never run into beyonce!
(at janice's punching) do not, do not! (looks disgusted)
(to monica and with bulging eyes) why!?
this can not be happening!
the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the hitlers.
that is a great idea! and by the way, i do not mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. we can still get out.
will we love it so much with her next door? and she is going to be louder out here too. just the crickets and (apes janice's voice) "oh my god"!
(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she is right) well, we have to do something. we can not have her living next door. (janice's laughs loudly outside) oh, that does it too. (motions with his index finger like monica did)
the hitlers will be so disappointed.
wait! i just want you to know that... I am so happy you are going to be here.
because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
i never stopped loving you.
yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein.
now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and monica never have to know a thing.
(stunned) obviously.
do not say that. do not tangle the dream and take it away.
i understand.
(speaking as in pain) they are never coming down now.
no, no, no. no-no-no.
no, we are playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes.
now, that is a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to monica).
oh, okay, time's up!
oh that is not bad, pheebs?
okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, joey?
does south oregon have a sports-team? (joey strikes one from his list) there you go.
oooh that may be a new world's record (looks at his watch and picks up ross' pad)
uh, magellan? you got 46 states. (smiles and hands ross back his pad)
i am only one man! (monica heads out) okay ross, time is up!
look ross, if you do not know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself.
okay, but if you can not…no dinner!
sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
i do not know. maybe it is because it smells a little weird. it is like old pumpkins or something.
which smells delicious!
what?
tell her, I am allergic, and i will sue!
huh! where is the dog?!
phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
what is it doing here?
extremely allergic, okay? if I am anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
(gasping) really?
well, it still has to go, right?
okay, it is um…
(to joey) i have to! okay? it is time! (joey shrugs as if to say, "do what you have to do") okay, i hate dogs.
they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can not tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
(scared) is there a puppy here?
(to tag) okay, you are new!
okay, it is just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
and i do not want to say this, i do not you guys to hate me, but uh, i do not think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go. (an awkward silence ensues.) oh my god!!
(comes out of the bathroom) here i am.
how did you…know? (heads back into the bathroom)
(comes out of the bathroom) where is monica?
why not?
well, i, i should go in there.
why not?
this is ridiculous. (he heads for phoebe's bedroom)
monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away.
yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
and that does not scare you? (he walks out)
no, no he went for a walk.
please, please, please, do not be mad at me.
okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. y’know, for you, and…(clears his throat) i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i could not find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain. (points up and then over to the street)
clunkers?! oh my god!
(to clunkers) it is so good to see you!
it is up to you.
all right.
you got it. (starts looking at the pad, while ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) you got nevada twice.
yeah. (throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
hey.
you can always spot someone who is never seen one of his plays before. notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
(staring at a woman across the room) ross, ten of the clock.
no, ten of the clock.
(sighs and gestures to explain) there is a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten of the clock!
she is amazing! she makes the women that i dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'excuse me. blarrglarrghh.'
oh please, could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up here.
thank you, buddy.
y'think?
oh god, i can not believe I am even considering this... I am very very aware of my tongue...
here goes. (he walks over to her but just stands there.)
hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... chandler! chandler is my name, and, uh...(he clears his throat noisily)...hi.
yes, yes i did, but what i did not say was what i was about to say, what i wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (he walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
(running back) she said yes!! she said yes!! (to joey) awful play, man. whoah. (to all) her name's aurora, and she is italian, and she pronounces my name 'chand-lrr'. 'chand-lrr'. i think i like it better that way. (to joey) oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (he fishes a card out of his pocket.)
hey, kids.
well, i can not believe I have been here almost seven seconds and you have not asked me how my date went.
it was unbelievable. i-I have never met anyone like her. she is had the most amazing life! she was in the israeli army...
alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
we talked 'til like two. it was this perfect evening... more or less.
oh, I am sorry, so 'we' is?
who is rick?
oh, so you are divorced?
oh, I am sorry, then you are widowed?...hopefully?
so tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
ethan? there is, there is an ethan?
so explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
...hm.
what 'not work out'? I am seeing her again on thursday. did not you listen to the story?
well, y'know, i had some trouble with it at first too, but the way i look at it is, i get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. i mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
are we greeting each other this way now? because i like that.
thank god you did not try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she will scratch your eyes right out.
someone is left a glass on the coffee table. there is no coaster. it is a cold drink, it is a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
oh no, it is terrific, it is... it is... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you have finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
where is joey? his mom's on the phone.
c'mon, we are roommates! (he goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) my eyes!! my eyes!!
oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i want to borrow a coupla things, aurora spent the night, i really want to make her breakfast.
yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know.. (he starts to raid the fridge.)
no, no resentment, believe me, it is worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you will remember for the rest of your life? well, every- single- second is like that with aurora.. and I have just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. monica, can you help me with the door? (he has armloads of stuff.)
god, i love these fingers...
no, actually i meant my fingers. look at  them, look at how happy they are.
oh no nonononononnononono, do not go.. (he kisses her and pulls her back down.)
do not go.
(to himself) too bad, she is leaving.
well, i thought- i thought you talked to rick.
what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you!
i know there will be many moments in the years to come when I will regret asking the following question, but- and andrew is?
oh, so what you are saying is you are not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?
well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
you.
nono, just you.
lose the other guys.
c'mon, we are great together, why not?
...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it is like I am two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there is this other guy. actually it is the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... and he is saying, y'know, 'this is too hard! get out! get out!'
i do not know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they do not exactly let each other finish...
...the second guy.
sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
(to ross) "big guy?"
something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) hello?
honey, you are screaming.
(yawning) oh, that is great.
(clearly not so interested) awesome.
(angry) funniest guy she is ever met! (to the door) I am funny, right...? what do you know, you are a door... you just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) save it for inside! (he enters)
hey!
so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner state. frankly I would sooner be in any other state. (monica looks at phoebe, who also does not know what to say.) and what is with oklahoma having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, I am from the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
(laughs, but then moves to phoebe) and do not get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk.
what is with the word you all? you know, just... two words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, I will have the fricken? (monica laughs) see, that is... that is funny with the fricken, right?
yeah, he came up...
(to phoebe) were you there?
hey! (joey does not look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. chandler waits for joey to finish.) i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks.
(can not believe what he hears) well, thank god your livelihood does not depend on it.
monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she is ever met.
yes! am i crazy to be this upset?
yeah!
ye.... (stops because he realises what joey just said, and stares at him. at this moment monica enters)
hey!
what are you guys talking about?
you got a man who is a nanny...? you got a manny...? (monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. joey realises they also should laugh and punches ross. now all three of them laugh, but very fake. chandler seems happy again.)
you know, i do not mind a... male nanny, but i do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)
if I would known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
what is so funny about that? (they realise it was not a joke)
did you tell her what we talked about? (joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
so those were pity laughs? pity laughs? (joey and ross walk away from the kitchen)
oh yeah? is he funnier than me?
i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
well, I am off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
really...? see... that is the thing: you got to keep it smart, people!
i love you too. (monica and chandler kiss. he turns to joey.) and... i like you as a friend. (they hug and pat each other on the back.)
see ya! (he leaves the apartment)
we can? all right, I am tryin' that.
so, saturday night, the big night, date night, saturday night, sat-ur-day night!
not a one.
oh, right, right, shut up.
no, i know, but it is just so hard, you know? i mean, you are sitting there with her, she has no idea what is happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there is the horrible awkward moment when you have handed her the note.
oh, thanks, but i think she would feel like we are gangin' up on her.
ooh, i hate when my father calls me that.
oh. well, hold on camper, are you sure you have thought this thing through?
it is just you and rachel, just the two of you? this is a date. you are going on a date.
yuh-huh.
well, you may want to rethink the dirty underwear. this is basically the first time she is going to see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
there you go.
where are they? where are they?
it is great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
here we go.
hey, janice.
hey, that is not good. can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
what?
(covering) what... did you get me there?
bullwinkle socks. that is so sweet.
that is great.
well, I am going to get another espresso. can i get you another latte?
that is it?
oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
janice. hi, janice. ok, here we go. i do not think we should go out anymore. janice.
here is the thing, janice. you know, i mean, it is like we are different. I am like the bing, bing, bing. you are like the boom, boom, (chandler flails his hand out and hits janice in the eye)... boom.
oh, my god, I am so sorry. are you ok?
(to phoebe) i hit her in the eye! i hit her in the eye! this is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
oh, i do not know, a million?
I am fine.
I am not fine. here she comes.
how do you do that?
we should always always break up together.
I am free! I am free!
yeah, baby!
making chocolate milk. do you want some?
well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she is celebrating that by going on a date with him.
oh, hey.
(to robert) so ah, is not a bit cold out for shorts?
right, right. sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
(standing up) I am up! I am up, I have gotten up now! anybody ah, want anything?
okay ross, why do not you come with me?
robert’s coming out.
no. he.....he is coming out of his shorts.
the man is showing brain.
(to ross) wellll?
what do we do? what do we do?
like an eclipse.
your liking it, huh?
no, actually laurie’s a boy.
hey.
you mean a three pointer?
I am sorry, I am sorry, it just seems that robert is not as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
stretchy pants! why, those are the greatest things in the world! if i were you i would wear them every day, every day!
hmmm, that is very cool.
i can not believe she cracked your code!
no, beth does not die, she does not die. does she rachel?
we can not tell him, you can not go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
yeah, we got, um-hmm.
(to monica) she is not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
no rach, it is not just you. my thirtieth birthday certainly was not that much fun.
ross, a sports car? would not it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
(to joey) would you put that back on?! monica’s going to be here any minute!
(frustrated) okay, for the last time. it is not named for each individual man.
oh well, not as lovely as you. i mean, i can not believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (to mr. geller) and you! i can not believe that you would have a tux that is thirty years old! (puts his hand on mr. geller’s shoulder.)
ohh! (he quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
okay! okay! everybody down! everybody down! (rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. as everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
(getting up to investigate) okay, everybody stay here. i will find out what is going on.
hey-hey are you drunk?
okay, here is the thing. we have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! all of your friends are in there and your parents!
yes!
yes!!
okay, here is the thing. we are going to get you some coffee and they will never know that you are drunk.
yeah, I will take care of it.
(laughing) okay we have to do something about your breath.
that is still yours. okay, now remember it is a surprise party. so, when you go in, act surprised.
okay.
okay before we start the celebration, monica has to go put on her party dress.
see? (does his laugh.) here we go. (starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of mr. geller who is sitting at the table and mrs. geller who is standing next to him.)
(correcting her) phil.
now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (monica stumbles on the steps.) okay, (catches her) you are doing great. you are doing great. you are doing fine.
monica’s a little drunk.
(to monica) go change! (to phoebe) she does not want her parents to know she is drunk.
monica’s wasted.
(to rachel) okay, will you just go help her change please!
okay, open ours next. open ours next!
for my last birthday you gave me a hug! (to rachel) okay, read the card! read the card!
no-no-no-no! that was the joke!
no, because you are not a grandmother!
(to a waiter) oh that is great! right there! can we get some of that over here please? (the waiter comes over) there we go.
(to monica) how are you feeling?
(to monica) now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and do not talk to anyone.
pheebs!!
i think it is necessary. (backs away anyhow.)
what?
okay, here we go.
hey! how did it go?
well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
that is funny, we were doing the same thing!
yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the numbers.
it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell.
(to ross) maybe you do that next time you get married!
hey!
our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
you know you do not want me to help. you can not have it both ways!
kind of. she is coming by to interview us and see where we live.
(pointing at himself) little people?
what...? no!
(he stands up and he feels very offended) i do not, and I am offended by the insinuation!
I will admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
ok, ok, here we go.
here we go. stand up straight. (smiling) big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
but you already gave all your money to charity!
i do not think you can do that!
that is sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.
oh, because we love kids. love ‘them to death.well, not actually to death, that is just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
what?
of course it was!
rat bastard!
oh, it is just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. he is great with
(screams to interrupt joey) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......aaaaaa-doption!!
oh, just like i said. that crazy... bert... roaming the halls. (joey bangs on
we will talk to you later, bert. everythng's fine!!
oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother... ernie.
(nervous smile) you can not make this stuff up!
what the hell are you doing?
well, we are not.
we do not have a code word.
any room that is not behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
(escorting joey to the door) you have to get out of here. you slept with
ok!
what?
and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! and we do not want to buy your bat! (joey lowers his bat)
i can explain... joey...
oh, that is really ok.
wrong number?
that is great!
hello...? have you seen joey's bat?
honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend.
gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
there is this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim...
fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party...
hey hey! where is the birthday girl?
oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
i know, what are we going to do?
I am not going to vermont with this monica!
to be fair this one does have nuts.
hi emma! it is the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap?
we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. because of you! happy birthday. (ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
was that emma? is she up?
i do not know! you will tell us on monday!
to the bathroom!
(yelling) what are you doing? get the hell out of here! (phoebe and joey come out looking shocked)
you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right?
I am begging you stop.
(also very excited) that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in vermont!
that is a bear.
ok, on your mark... get set... go!!!
i bought you. how did i forget that that is all you do?
they left.
I am sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?
emma, you even know it is your birthday today? you are one! one-year-old, that is little.
ooh! that is my girl!
did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom?
me too...
there is no-one around. why do not we just take this one?
i was kidding.
no, not yet.
hey, guys! come on! you got to see what emma just did.
emma, how old are you? how old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)
let us do it, come on!
what?! what are you talking about?
who is the father?
why not?
as in barbara streisand’s husband james brolin?
y’know i am the groom right? i was told it was kind of big deal.
before we go out there I have got a present for ya.
no?
I have been taking dancing lessons.
yeah, the last six weeks. i wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
so? would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
i do not know, it is these new shoes, they are all slippery.
not well.
thank you.
bravo dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
funny: ha-ha or funny: (mimes blowing his brain out.)
what size shoes do you wear?
great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can i borrow the boots from your costume?
(looking at joey’s feet) those are not eleven and a half.
and the world will never know.
yes, i told him how talented you were. i told him all about days of our lives.
but you are not just a soap actor. you are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
did it turn into sand?
(sliding up behind her) no. no, i will not. do you know why i took all those lessons? see, for the first time i did not want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
why?
good morning everyone, it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) yes, ken is it?
(laughs) well, don�t believe everything you hear, ken. (both turning away to files) but yeah, that�s true. alright, let�s get started, by take a look at last quarter�s figures. (the female next to chandler starts smoking, towards her:) ah, claudia, aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?
no, no, no-no-no. i smoked for years, then i quit. right now, i can�t remember why. (to everyone:) you�re not allowed to smoke in this office. not right?
alright, lo�look. i don�t smoke anymore. but if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it�s fine. (everyone lights up) so you all smoke then? that�s almost rude, that i�m not.
(loud) ken, please! no, i can�t, i can�t smoke. if i smoke, my wife would kill me.
i always liked you, ken. (takes a cigarette)
actually, in oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
no! i just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. for example, in hawaii cigarettes are called leyhallalookoos.
uch, do you think, monica is going to be able smell it?
pheebs?
(getting in) okay, something to cover the smell � oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) unscented!
no thanks, i�m good.
(shrinks back) right. you know what? actually i just get off the plane, so i�m feeling kind of gross. maybe i should just take a shower.
(still backs away) alright, the truth is, i soiled myself during some turbulences.
yes, but i just had one. two. two tiny cigarettes. okay, five. a pack. two pack�a�a carton. three big fat cartons in two days. (how many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the us?) but it�s over, i made a decision, i�m not going to smoke anymore.
but, those are for you.
i messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
will power? i�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
�kay, look: can we just drop this? i�m not going to smoke again.
you forbid me?
you know, i flew a long way t see my loving wife? is she here by the way?
oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
then, i might as well � (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). not really sure what to do now.
fine. what!?
you serious? (follows)
right, fine, i�ll do it, but no talking.
and no kissing your neck.
and lots of kissing your neck.
look, i can�t do this. i can�t make love to you while we�re fighting this way.
that was a celebration of life. alright, look, i�m not going to do this. alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
mean it?
you are incredible. unless, i�i�m not going to smoke again. and if i do, i promise, i will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)
yeah, let�s celebrate life!
uhh. you are welcome.
what?
but you said you forgave me. it was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.
leave it.
you tricked me to get me into bed?
i feel so used.
i would never lie to get someone into bed.
i suppose that monica will have the � manipulative shrew.
you mean the lully story?
oh yeah, that�s what she says. but maybe you�re not ovulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
(to joey) you not going to believe this: she lied! she tricked me into having sex with her.
what�s the matter with me? why i�m such a girl?
so you never had sex with a kennedy, have you?
no, no, no, i do not, i do not really want to play.
that is not true! i wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. i wanted to start drinking in the morning. do not say that i do not have goals!
yeah, all right, I will play.
no, no, no, you say that proudly.
and was the curse lifted?
but wait a minute though, how are we going to get there, though, because my mom will not let me cross the street.
and then tineals.
wow! just like in the pros.
the ball is janice. the ball is janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks ross’s foot instead.)
sorry. I am sorry. y'know what, we are just going to throw it.
no, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between ross’s legs.) twenty-three!! seventy-four!! (ross stands up and looks at him) you want to go shotgun?
(from the shotgun) hike!
great! now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
no, no, no, no, no!
(running up) hey joey, do you want to play football or you want to.. (sees marhan) hi, I am chandler.
mar-haaaan.
well, that went well.
y'know, i was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
whoa-ho, whoa! no, i was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over janice thing you were talking about.
thanks. what, let me have her?! what do mean? like if you did not i would not have a shot?
math!! you are giving me math! all right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we will see who gets her.
well now you have two. hey, i am good at math.
hey! well, I have been preparing for that my entire life! or something about you that is mean!
before!!
is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
okay, good.
(to margha) hi.
no-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we are just switching teams.
no ah, hold on a second joe, where do dutch people come from?
and the other ah, dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the netherlands, right?
fine with me.
yes!!
well, you do not you have captain hook explain it to her.
you hear that! that is her chose, mister I will let you have her! i win! you suck! i rule all! a mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
wh-what?
y'know what, it does not matter, ‘because she picked me. me! from now on i get the dates and you have to stay home on saturday nights watching ready, set, cook!
we are not going to lose to girls.
okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
hey-hey-hey rachel, funny thing. actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you are five feet short, so we win!
guys! guys! come on! it is thanksgiving, it is not important who wins or loses. the important thing is, (to joey) the dutch girl picked me! me! not you! holland loves chandler! thank you, amsterdam! good night!!
yes. yes, there is, they play on sundays and monday nights.
could not i just say, "this is ross?"
(knocking on the window while outside) sorry! (runs off.)
joey! joe! (sees that he is not here and starts investigating. he picks up the bag of chips.) full bag. (he picks up the beer.) beer’s still cold. something terrible must have happened here! (he decides it is not that important; sits down on rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (runs over to stevie.) stevie, i was never here! (runs out.)
my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita! (he runs out the door, grabs the back of rosita, and we can hear joey and rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
hey!
yeah, I would love to but I have tried that so many times they will not even let me in the store anymore.
(excitedly) are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year?
that is awesome! that is great! what made you do it?!
whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joey’s chair?
i thought i broke joey’s chair! that is why i replaced it with mine!
well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
I am gettin’ my chair back! (heads for joey and rachel’s.)
joey you broke my chair!!
i think i should get the chair!
because you (points to joey) broke a chair and you (points to rachel) broke a chair! the only one around here that has not broke a chair, is me!
well, where is the logic in that?!
so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing!
what are you guys? like a gang or something?!
are not you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
sorry.
hello!
yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. chandler sees her reaction.) that did not happen, i made that up!
okay, but do not you think this is a little extreme?
yeah i know, we are losing ross, joey said hence…
you are on in 5 ms. minnelli.
so you are really okay with this?
now that is so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum.
okay, what is in here? rocks?
so, rocks.
look, we just think that maybe she is being a little unreasonable.
kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would have happened.
well, i think it is very brave what you said.
pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?
uh, ross?
yeah, we are so sorry.
hi!
oh yeah, there-there she is!
or 'you are such a nice guy' means 'I am going to be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
yeah, it is like when you are a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
"so how does it feel knowing you are about to die?"
hey, that was really good!
okay. "so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?"
"smoke away."
i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone.
relax your hand!
not so much!
hey!
alright, now try taking a puff.
alright.. okay. no. give it to me.
it is fine, it is fine. look, do you want to get this part, or not? here.
do not think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that is been missing from your hand. when you are holding it, you feel right. you feel complete.
nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke. (takes a puff.) oh.. my.. god. (he continues to smoke.)
oh, satan's minions at work again...
I am smoking. I am smoking, I am smoking.
and this- is my reward!
okay, so this time i will not quit!
all right! I am putting it out, I am putting it out. (he drops it in phoebe's coffee.)
what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry.
oh, yeah. I would marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know I am going to be doing that at parties, right? (does the impression)
yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
i personally could have a gallon of alan.
well, maybe it is a contest, y'know? like, collect all five?
hey, this is so unfair!
so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking is not annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can not you accept me for this?
hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
really? he does? (taking the phone) hey, buddy, what is up! oh, she told you about that, huh. well, yeah, i have one now and then. well, yeah, now. well, it is not that big- ..well, that is true,.. gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. well, okay, thanks! (he hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it would be talking too.
joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong?
(deadpan) ooh, I am alive with pleasure now.
(sarcastic) oh, she is sorry! i feel better!
...that is it. I am getting cigarettes.
(leaving) i do not care, i do not care! game's over! I am weak! I have got to smoke! I have got to have the smoke!
(returns) yeah, alright.
see, now, why would you assume that? just because we are married? i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you will excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries.
wow.
well, i think it is great that you are going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood!
emma? emma? look at me! well, i think I will go downstairs for a while.
no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it is okay, it is okay. i did not go. do not cry, it is just a bit! I am your uncle chandler; funny is all i have!
i do not do that.
I will try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth?
today is the sixth.
yes, it is also 2003.
it is okay. go take the test and see if we are okay.
tough crib.
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times.
i am not working. there is not much to do around here!
oh, good, because as of four of the clock this afternoon, i am not.
i - i do not think i can.
because of emma.
sorry.
well, she is aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
well, i can not say "hump" or "screw" in front of the b-a-b-y.
horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for?
you guess I am right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you would not have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
emma was doing it!
ooh, she is asleep, that means we can...
i think we may have really done it this time.
you may want to get some more of those too.
where is emma?
do not ask me, i was in there canoodling you!
okay. (runs out.)
all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating.
no, no, no.
what? why?
your family name is tribbiani.
are you looking at naked tribe's women?
that is a pig.
hey! (joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
what?!
how can he do that? did not you sign a lease?
oh, yeah! absolutely! anything you need man! but you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
he thought you said gonad.
love what you have done with the place.
oh yeah!
oh, the tears are real.
what are you doing?
you built a fort did not ya?
(notices something) oh my god, the air purifier! ross's air purifier! all i heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
i hate this thing!
(entering) hello children!
okay. (starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
bye-bye little puppet joey hand?
you mean this. (does the maneuver perfectly.)
(gasps) all right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is ross! i survived college with him!
okay.
no-no-no-no!
okay, so he is out of here.
well, i-i-I am done with this. you want anything ross? sports? international? apartment listings?
not even on page 7?
what about that circled one?
yes, it is.
there we go!
let us go quicker.
yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. well that is great! y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
yeah, you do not want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
it is a kitchen slash bathroom.
we are bad people.
yes that was a nice place!
not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
what are we going to do?
about ross!
(grabbing the phone) of course he has this big huge dog! that uh, barks into the night. (listens.) well, who does not love dogs? (thinks.) ah, he is a tap dancer! (listens.) yes, some would say that is a lost art. (thinks.) he is a pimp! (listens.) there you go! yes, he is a pimp. he is a big, tap dancing pimp! (pause.) hello?
ohhhhh!
98. 99. 100. okay, go!
here we go! here we go!
hey!
you are kidding, no!
yeah!
yes! ross, you have to stay!
all right, buddy!
well, i see you have had a very productive day. do not you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
all right! (he joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) is not this a woman's hat?
you know, it is... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I will be right back. (goes into the kitchen)
we are just hanging out by the spoons. ladle?
carol? i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
so, uh, how often can you do it?
hey, sweetums.
come on, you are going to bloomingdale's with julie? that is like cheating on rachel in her house of worship.
what did you just do?
what did you just do?
of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
how do you.
well, maybe it is because of the way you are dressed.
(slides the juice across the counter which joey catches) what do you care? you are an actor. this is your day job. this is not supposed to mean anything to you.
(pours more and slides the refill to joey) all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody is going to come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where are you going to run?
you are damn right I am right. i say you show this guy what you are made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
all right. now go see miss kitty and she will fix you up with a nice hooker.
hey pheebs, what is up?
buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…do not let phoebe in.
well, phoebe i thought I would—(off phoebe’s look)—yeah, what the hell. (exits with phoebe.)
hey babe.
who says you can not get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? maybe we can take it back?
how about to the street say from the balcony?
okay. how about in that cabinet?
how about the closet by the bathroom? (the secret green door by the bathroom.)
oh no-no-no, i will do it. honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (tries the door.) it is locked, you have to help me. why is it locked?
oh y’know, I have been living here a while and I have never seen what is inside that closet. what is, what is in there?
do not try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
fine.
(walking casually away) love you.
phoebe if it helps alexandra has only been massaging monica for like three years. (phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and monica glares at him.) if! i said, "if it helps!" (goes to the bedroom.)
i was not trying to open your closet! i was not trying to open your closet! i swear! (running into the kitchen and sees its joey.)
monica has a secret closet and she will not let me see what is in it.
i do not know! what could she possibly be hiding in here that i can not see?!
why would monica be keeping richard in here?
and here we go…
there has got to be a way!
yeah. (checks his hair.) oh no wait, I am not an nine-year-old girl.
maybe monica has a bobby pin.
so, how is the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming?
that is a good idea.
okay. (they switch places and chandler gets out a credit card.) so uh, ross is kind of bummed huh?
well, it is not your fault. what are you going to do? not take her to the hospital? y’know? you are doing nothing wrong. (pause) except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (he loses his card behind the door.) richard? if-if you are in there, could you pass me my credit card?
not to shabby, i got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (he takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what is behind the green door! it is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) oh my god!
(laughs) you are messy.
i married fred sanford!
no, honey you are not sick! look, i do not love you because you are organized, i love you in spite of that.
yes! and look, now that i know if i got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
hey.
so rachel’s all moved out huh? how are you taking it?
are you okay?
(entering) hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
i just saw janice.
yeah, she was at rockefeller center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. i almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.
yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
oh, y'know what, I am going to be okay, you do not have to throw a party for me.
oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. y'know, it is supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
hello-dillillio!!
(to monica) take off your shirt!
yeah, jell-of just like mom used to make.
(to monica) okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
hi joey’s sisters!
oh, I am taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
no-no-no-no, no, it is a good thing. why must we dial so speedily anyway? why must we rush through life? why can not we savor the precious moments? (to one of joey’s sisters) those are some huge breasts you have.
well, my apartment is not there anymore, because i drank it.
yeah, i ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’
ah, i fooled around with joey’s sister. (phoebe gasps) well, that is not the worst part.
i can not remember which sister.
okay! you do not think i thought of that?
(to monica) you see you can not tell which one is which either, dwha!!
veronica. look, it is got to be veronica, the girl in the red skirt. i definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
look, when I have been drinking, sometimes i tend to get overly friendly, and I am sorry.
why can not we talk in here? with, with, witnesses.
it is got to be the first one.
yep, I am in a tree.
well, that is the part where you tell him that i moved to france. when actually I will be in cuba.
what if mary-angela comes to the door and i ask for mary-angela?
(shocked) joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
I am here to see mary-angela.
where is mary-angela?
this teramisu is, is excellent. did you make it mary-angela?
well, it is, it is yummy. so mary-angela do you like it?
so um, mary-angela, what is your second favorite?
would you just please....give me the receipt ‘because this is great. it is top notch.
so will i.
oh no-no-no i was just squinting. that does not mean anything.
will you excuse me i have to um..... (walks to the hall)
(startled) hey!
look, i may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) um, i just got out of a relationship and I am not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
ahhhh, you are not mary-angela.
this is so bad. if-if you are not mary-angela, then-then who is?
oh, this is soo bad. (does not see mary-angela)
no joey! no joey! do not joey! joey!
(pats him on the shoulder) you are it! now run and hide!
i was not sure which one mary-angela was. (all of joey’s sisters gasp) look, I am sorry okay, i was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to joey) are ya?
joey if you want to punch me, go ahead, i deserve it. but i just want you to know that i would never soberly hurt you or your family, you are my best friend. i would never do anything like this ever again.
okay, absolutely!
you have got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still does not know which one is mary-angela.)
what?! (cookie punches him)
do not worry.
yeah. we do not feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.
well, it is just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just do not feel like we have the energy. plus, we do not think it is fair that every year the burden falls on us.
no, no! we made this decision together.
do not let yourself get manipulated this way!
we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you?
why come all the way from kansas to do that?
you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
somebody is going to pick us.
I am telling ya! it is going to happen. next year it is going to be you, me and the little hemingway bing. (pause) what, he is my favourite author!
(after a long pause) "the firm"?
you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year.
I am serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
tell me more.
you obviously have not tasted my palmolive potatoes!
oh my god!
hmm, the game's at one.
dinner is at four, we will never going to make it back.
you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
look, monica has been working hard all day, she did not want to host this thing in the first place, we should not go!
okay. (pause) and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries!
i can not believe they are not here! i slave and i slave for what? they have ruined cranberry day!
(peeping) they are out there!
(peeping) everything is so distorted! looks like joey has a giant hand! which says "rangers" on it. they went to the game!
(looking through the peephole again) ross' shirt is torn.
yeah, and there is a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
(relieved) oh thank god!
(looking through the peephole) that is a lie, you went to the game, i can see joey's hand.
guys, I would listen to her. the vein is bigger than I have ever seen it. (monica looks at chandler)
ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts!
please let me stay on this side of the door.
the cranberries...?
he is doing that weird eye contact thing. do not look at him, do not look at him! (they both look away)
the floating heads do make a good point.
well, you manheads are not any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
that would be a lot more convincing if you were not drooling.
a little late for that.
uhm, we have got turkey grease.
can you ever feel your ears?
(sarcastically) oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i do not have tools!
okay, look, I am going to pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push!
come on guys, push!
my cranberries!
argh! i can not believe what you did. monica's going to kill you!
(to monica) look! look! look what the... look what... look what the floating heads did!
what is going on?
and?
are you serious? (they hug)
that is the exact same thing.
wait a minute, wait. you are telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who did not want you back?!
my grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
hey.
oh, that is-that is okay, no problem. (he starts to look around her office.)
yes, i realise that.
that is the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
thanks, it is ah, gaelic, for ‘thy turkey’s done.’ so ah, I am going to go, nice, nice meeting you.
hello.
(holding a tissue) and is this in case the house sneezes?
oh, I am glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? dug my action, did she? checkin’ out the chan-chan man!
yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I will do it.
(entering) hey, my father’s house does that!
well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there is nothing like a cool, crisp new york evening.
of course, i did not get to enjoy any of that, because joanna’s such a big, dull dud!
(entering with rachel) I am telling ya, joanna’s got it all wrong. okay? all i said was, ‘this was fun. let us do it again sometime. I will give you a call.’
that is what you say at the end of a date.
to her face? look it is the end of the date, I am standing there, i know all she is waiting for is for me to say ‘I will call her’ and it is just y'know, comes out. i can not help it, it is a compulsion.
multiple, so many paper cuts.
(sarcastic) oh, well give me the phone then.
look, you can not call somebody after this long just to say, ‘in case you did not notice, i do not like you!’
nooo!! she is really dull! and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
all right! fine! but it is just a lunch date, no more than an hour! and from now on i get my own dates, i do not want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
that is just a lot of big talk, y'know.
it is not a big deal. it is, just it is right here, (points to his eye) and it is all the time.
(he looks over at rachel, who nods her head) yes, this, this was pleasant.
the food there was, was great.
so take care.
well, this was great. I will give you a call. we should do it again sometime. (rachel is disappointed)
noo!
look, I am sorry. okay? I am weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
ahhhh—I am not going to call you.
I am sorry. I am-I am-I am sorry that i said i was going to when I am not. look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? and this is not rachel’s fault. it is me. i have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. i have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. and I am really sorry, it is just that this is not, this is not going to work out.
yeah, of-okay.
well this is great! I will give you a call! we should do it again sometime!
hey! wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
all right.
would not that be frank the iii?
hey! do we have a baby name yet?
well, it certainly worked for that valdez kid.
hey, y’know what, if you are going to do that, if you are going to name him joey, you should name him chandler. (phoebe does not think so.) oh, come on! chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he is very loveable, once you get to know him.
well, chandler will be there for you too. i mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he will be there. and he will bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you are really hot.
hey!
and now you are giving me the message!
you actually think that something can happen between emily and susan?
hi! hi! you are crazy! okay? this is emily. emily is straight.
raymond chandler.
okay, there are no famous joey’s. except for, huh, joey buttafucco.
okay, look, joey! come on, think about it, first of all, he will never be president. there is never going to be a president joey.
wow, you are, you are right. i have a horrible, horrible name.
okay.
no, no, you are right, it is a ridiculous name!
yes it is! from now on, i have no first name.
i have no name.
okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, clint.
okay, so what name am i cool enough to pull off?
it is clint. it is clint! (he heads for his bedroom.)
it is clint! clint!
(entering) okay. okay. all right. help! am i a mark, or a john?
all right look, am i serious, okay? tomorrow at 3:30 i am going down to the courthouse.
hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. okay, it is probably why kids picked on me in school, and why i never do well with women… so, as of 4 of the clock tomorrow, I am either going to be mark johnson or john markson.
(pleased) really?!
okay. thanks.
you want to hug it out?
yay!
okay!
bye, pheebs!
ha! ha! ha!
no-no-no-no, we are done.
and, we are done with the yogurt. (sets yogurt down on table)
(to ross) ah, it is just a weekend, big deal!
ok, you are going to have to stop that, forever!
you think?
ok, so it is just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one?
what rule? there is no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio
well, let us just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
what do you mean, like, buy it together?
you think we are ready for something like that?
well, it is a pretty big commitment, i mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
I am not moving out.
yeah, yeah, it is just that with my last roommate kip...
it is just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
aw, do not do that
fine. (joey and chandler walk towards the door)
more coffee over here, please!
so what are you going to do?
oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
that is patio furniture!
(gesturing towards another table) what about the birds?
you pick one.
oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
not like that, i will not! (pauses) kip would have liked the birds! (joey turns and gives chandler a dirty look)
so, what do you think?
i know!
what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it is time for you to swoop in!
my catholic friend is right. she is distraught. you are there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross! (ross and chandler look off into the distance. joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
wha-
hey!
yeah, get out!
(to joey) one more game?
hey!
i do not see him. (to monica) do you see him?
what?! no! no!
(incredulous) i do not know what that is like?! up until i was 25 i thought the only response to, "i love you," was, "oh crap!"
(interrupting him) we did not play it!!
i did not know you read tea leaves.
what does yours say pheebs?
well, I am sure you get another one at ann taylor’s.
phoebe, did you see that?! he totally checked you out! he is so cute! (looking at his tea.) mine has a picture of the village people, what does that mean?
i know it is tough now, but things will get better.
I am not great at the advice, can i interest you in a sarcastic comment? some cheese?
let us just say if i can not find the right cd case i just put it in the nearest one.
in the james taylor case.
honey, I am going to save you some time, 200 cds, not one of them in the right case.
well, if we are going to do that we should come up with some kind of order. y’know alphabetically or by genre?
they were just giving those away at the store (off monica’s look) in exchange for money.
oh my god, honey we are so meant to be together. we both have copies of the annie soundtrack.
what problem did you tell him you had?
(singing) the sun’ll come out…tomorrow! bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow… (the girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) …there will be sun.
you can always sell your baby.
wow, ralph lauren is really going out of there way to show they are not in the baby buying business.
oh I am sorry, you are kicking me out of my own living room?
I will be in there. (goes into the bedroom.)
oh come on man! at least let me finish this last one.
okay.
no-no, why do not you hang on to that one.
okay, that is like the least fun game ever.
oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) nope, that patch is no good. (joey and monica both do their fake laughs.)
or what my father called thursday night.
y'know, i would have bet good money that he would be the first one of us to get married.
always illegal joe.
if that does not keep kids in school, what will?
(entering, carrying a briefcase) hi.
y'know, i forgot the combination to this about a year ago? i just carry it around. do you have any chap stick?
y'know what, pretty good.
good! i have not smoked yet today, i feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
thanks
what check thing?
(reading the check) pete becker. pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) is this him?
who is he huggin’?
this guy invented moss 865! every office in the world uses that program!
there you go!!
(to the girls who are staring at him) what?
(in a feminine way) oh my god! (and he jumps all around)
okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
okay, then get the lobster!
hey! ready to go?
what are you doing?
great, a faster way to tell people that I am unemployed and childless .
the tall girl who would not sleep with you?
bet she would sleep with you now...
let me see what you wrote about yourself: "doctor paleontology, two kids... " (pause) you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you have one very similar interest!
maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on ross' computer) "also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she is now my girlfriend. i do not care what society says. it is the best sex I have ever had"... aaand send!
oh, I am so sorry!
you are not going to need my help?
oh good, because I have already thought of 3... 4! I have just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
i believe i read that somewhere!
i respectfully disagree.
who cares? nobody reads those things
i do not have a page.
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.
hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! (monica hangs up) I am so going to get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
oh, you will see my friend.
(faking sympathy) and so young.
well, how you died was funny.
it kills over one americans every year.
you want to talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i would not be able to go with him to key west!
hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..do not tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
huh! so that is what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you are not actually going to send these out are ya?
no, come on, you know that is not true.
well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
alright look, let us think about this, ok, do you really think that people are going to stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are going to post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you are dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
right, i mean, come on, I am sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
ross, what are you... what are you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)you are having a memorial service for yourself!?
ross, do not press send, do not press se... !
there you go! someone came!
(in a mournful voice) please, come in.
oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
some guy, tom gordon.
(entering, very upset) ok tommy, that is enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
ok! (shuts the door behind tom)
please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it is probably the way you stand!
oh, that is not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it is 15 years later and we are still best friends. does not that count for something?
I am sure it is somebody for you. now, go hide. (ross hides in the bedroom again)
kori? kori weston?
wow! you look amazing!
chandler, chandler bing. I am not gay, I am not gay at all.
do not listen to him, he is in a really bad mood! (let us her in)
i did not know ross and you were so close.
I am sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, I am sure he is pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
oh, yeah! how did you meet her?
were you so late because you were burring this woman?
how can she be great if she is from poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) that joke would have killed in albany.
hey, look at this! (holding a newspaper) they are lighting the big christmas tree tonight.
all right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! i really wanted to take kathy to this, i can not believe i missed it.
really?! i did not think girls ever just wanted a fling.
y’know what? there is some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
well, i have a girlfriend, I am-I am happy. so, i no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
oh and ross was like what? a lion tamer?
hey, you know what you can do? i remember reading about this director, i think it was orson wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. then they would all know, who is boss.
(he glares at him for a while) yes.
i say, drew! are you seeing anybody right now? (drew looks at him) og-ee-op, I am not asking for me, I am… i mean… no, I am-I am not gay, I am not asking you out. I am not-I am not-I am not gay!
see my friend-my friend, rachel, she wants to be set up.
oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with rachel.
(to drew) oh, by the way, that is her full name.
oh well, that is uh, a little later than i uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
well, i do not really know what that is, but let us!!
(entering) hello, children!
(to rachel) have i got the 50 guys for you!
oh yeah, i just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! they are buying me drinks! they are giving me stuff! (to joey) knicks tonight?
wherever! I have got like 20!
y’know what, I am going to uh, play the field just a little more.
guys are signing over their 401-k’s to me?
(pause) yes. (to rachel) okay, there is this one guy, patrick, i think you are going to like him, he is really nice, he is funny, he is a swimmer.
yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
see, I am not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
oh, he works in the fine foods division.
it is a big company, i do not—if you—i…
oh yeah! with who?
yeah.
hey, man!
well, like father, like son.
really?! i-i thought you were not looking for something serious? i thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
ummmmmmmm, no.
why not?! I would be thrilled if i heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh i see.
(interrupting) oh, y’know, y’know what pheebs?
I am not jewish, so…
bad dream?
oh yeah, then uh, what was phoebe’s song about?
prague?
i did! i absolutely did!
I am sure you are right, but why?
oh, man. I am sorry, I am so-so sorry.
i know! i know!
well, y’know, you are-you are going to meet somebody! you are a great catch! y’know when i was telling all those guys about you, i did not have to lie once. (he sits down on the arm of her chair)
yeah! you graduated magma ku laude, right?
oh, it does not matter. (kisses her on the top of her head.) hey, y’know what, I have got two tickets to tonight’s rangers game, you want to come with me?
well, actually it is a hockey team, so it is angry canadians with no teeth.
have you ever been with a woman?
so there is no good time to ask that question.
hey!
oh, what is the matter?
yeah?
what?!
just out of curiosity did she tell you how you are going to go?
oh hi!
why do not you open with a joke?
wait a minute, hold the phone! you are not talking about chuckles university?!
that is the way i did it ‘til i was 19.
hey.
yes, you got something from the screen actor’s guild.
(opens and reads it) "benefits lapsed."
okay, it is not a check. they are saying your health insurance expired because, you did not work enough last year.
all right.
I am sorry man, there is never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
hey!
that is great, but should not you be on the toilet right now?
what is wrong with you?
this sounds like a hernia. you have to—you-you go to the doctor!
that is a hernia.
hey, will you grab me a cruller? (joey starts to groan and get up.) sit down! will you go to the hospital?!
i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and let us just get that thing…pushed back in.
hey.
oh joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that is nothing a little laser eye surgery will not fix!
listen, I am really glad you got the part.
but are you sure you can do this?
now, is that never talking about it again?!
I am sorry! hey-hey joe, why do not you uh, lift up your shirt? (he does.) take a look at this kiddo. (alex finally starts crying.) we have a crying child! roll the damn cameras!
what are you doing?
oh, all right.
hey!
sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who ever
no!
our balcony? seriously? that is so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said
so are you going to...talk to her?
you know when "that is fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
no no no. good. so you are moving on? do you have any idea where you are moving?
dude, do not rub my face in your crazy single life!
why did i get married?!
hey it is the most eligible man in ny. how is the moving on going?
well maybe you are going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,
what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!
maybe she did not move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
did she go out with him?
ah! the high road...
are you trying to get everybody divorced?
i thought i had to make the jokes!
oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here is my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you are up for it.
we still got it!
i do not get it neither, i mean you are obviously desperate, you are asking women how they want to be killed
by drowning or...?!
well...
wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?
i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
it�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
ok. first of all, this is green!
all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you.
ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mine
yeah, well, i guess you don�t need my help victor victoria!
oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
and done!
thanks. you want to see what it looks like?
yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about
no problem.
yeah.
i am sorry i am late. you�ll understand when you�ll see joey.
really? in front of all this people?
oh my god!
are those my wife�s nipples?
i got to stop this.
you, touching yourself, out!
�jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped him
(to monica) have i got a surprise for you? pack your bags!
what? no, I am taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont (shows them a brochure)!
so, what do you say? can you get out of work?
are you really that busy?
oh, that is ok.I will just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there and i need to change it (pause) oh, what do you mean it is not refundable? can i just come some other time? (pause) oh, can not you make an exception?"
(on the phone) "look, this is ridiculous! I am not paying for that room! ok?" (pause) "oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) yeah, I am going to vermont...
i do not have travel insurance.
hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation.
new york.
I am sorry, he is a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
well, that is impossible, can you check again, please?
let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we do not have a reservation?
just give us the cheapest room you have.
that is insane!
does that room have a closet i can lock him in? (pause) we will take it.
(aside, to ross) what!? they are totally ripping us off!
great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we are there!
dude, you are shaking!
usa today
and i also got... two more apples.
i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
yes, but the batteries...
thank you, thank you very much!
no!
oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
oh, i did not factor in the room tax.
what?
look, we have enough, just walk away.
there is a forest right outside.
ok, go quick!
i got you something from vermont! (sits down at the table)
six-hour trip to london. that is a lot of monica.
you got your passport?
there it is.
(entering, with joey) all right! let us do it!
okay, ‘because that is not going to get annoying.
hey, y’know what? i was wrong.
hey! (trots over)
oh. (goes and gets phoebe’s book as rachel comes in from her room.)
(entering, with phoebe’s book.) here you go phoebe! here you go phobo! phewbedo! phaybobo.
i am, I am ignoring you.
oh, what the hell is that?
okay, if you see a little version of me in there? kill it!
okay. listen-listen, we are not going to have to walk this way the entire time are we?
i think it is great. it is great. y’know, they are thinking of changing the name of this place.
to put the camera away!!!
well, i do not have to buy that, "I am with stupid" t-shirt anymore.
all right, look, you are not really going to buy that are you? do not you think you have embarrassed me enough for one day?
how can i answer that when I am pretending i do not know you?
oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them?
all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you are going to spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
okay, wait. all right, that is it, okay, I am out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (he trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
hey. (he nods at the hat.)
no-no-no, y’know what? i really should not have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really was not cool. and if it makes you feel any better, I have had a really lousy day.
yeah?
that is… that is was…
how did you? how? how?
I am going to go to the bathroom.
that was pretty intense huh?
(glares at him) i hope he did!
joey, it is been three days, okay.. your just a little homesick, okay. would you just try to relax. just, just try to enjoy yourself.
I would like to toast, ross and emily. of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or melba toast, if you will. (no one in the room laughs. he starts to get flustered.) okay. i known ross for a long time. in fact, i knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (ross looks embarrassed.) and i thought things were going to work out for him..until the day he over inflated her. (he laughs. jack looks at judy and no one in the room laughs.) ohh, dear god.. (a cellular phone rings.)
(continuing his toast.) and I am sure we are all very excited that ross and emily are getting married at montgomery hall. i mean to think, my friend getting married in monty hall. (no reaction from the people.) ohh, come on!! monty hall!! let us make a deal!! come on, you people!! all right, forget it!! congratulations, ross and emily. (he sits down.)
out loud?
so how are you doing?
the guy was hammered, okay? there is no way, you look like ross’s mother.
because he is crazy. okay? he came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in titanic.
ahh, you know what? that is....who would not want you?
(with the covers pulled up to his chin.) morning, ross.
yeah you are!!
well I have-I have never done that with you before.
so, ahh, how are ya? how ya...how ya... you okay?
yes...yes..uh-huh, you?(looking over at her. she looks back.) we did you.
oh yea yea, absolutely.
i do not want to look.
hey.
(very defensive.) I am not seeing monica.
what?
oh my god!
no!! okay!! what is with the third degree?! why do not you just shine a light in my eyes?! (joey looks totally confused.)
oh yea, your right. it is the second one.
what we did last night was....
totally crazy stupid. (he nods his head at the people seated.)
I am coming over tonight though, right?
wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.
well, that is what we said about joey...
how about joey... pepponi?
joey... switzerland?
joe...joe...joe...stalin?
well, it does not ring a bell with me...
might want to try joseph.
oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof.
she is not going to make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
so what does this mean?
i do not get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?
i know that one! ...no, that is popes into a volkswagen.
yeah, but that is like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it is a total party zoo.
what?
ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
...take off their hats!
you are kidding.
y'know, you would think i would have.
...he is in.
okay, bye, champ. now, i know there is going to be a lot of babes in san diego, but remember, there is also a lot to learn.
hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass!
might want to open with the snowman.
nothing for you, you have paolo. you do not have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! man, I am talking loud!
it is just that I am sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. i say this year, no dates, we make a pact. just the six of us- dinner.
y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
(quietly, to the others) that guy's going home with a note!
wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you are going to ask him to new year's, are not you. you are going to break the pact. she is going to break the pact.
yeah, because i already asked janice.
i snapped, okay? i could not handle the pressure and i snapped.
I am not saying it was a good idea, I am saying i snapped!
too many jokes... must mock joey!
aah, y'killing me!
y'know, if you are going to work late, i could look in on him for you.
okay, but if he asks, I am not going to lie.
fun bobby? your ex-boyfriend fun bobby?
i happen to know a fun bob.
that is so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night.
yeah, we played, we watched tv.. that juggling thing is amazing.
with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that.
y'know, it was not that big a deal. he just balled up socks... and a melon...
you remember janice.
(imitating) but you found me!
kill me. kill me now.
alright, janice, that is it! janice... janice... hey, janice, when i invited you to this party i did not necessarily think that it meant that we-
I am sorry you misunderstood...
oh, will you give me the thing. (snatches the camera)
(to a woman who he has clearly just met) and then the peacock bit me. (laughs) please kiss me at midnight. (she leaves)
ooh. uh, i do not know how to tell you this, but she is in monica's bedroom, getting it on with max, that scientist geek. ooh, look at that, i did know how to tell you.
and the moment of joy is upon us.
y'know, i uh.. just thought I would throw this out here. I am no math whiz, but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (makes kiss noise)
alright, somebody kiss me. somebody kiss me, it is midnight! somebody kiss me!
it is your mommy. it is your mommy.
that was one of the worse things ever. and not just on tv.
and say nothing?
no-no-no-no. (waves him away as monica and phoebe enter whispering to each other.) hey! (monica shushes him.)
hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?
secret? married people are not supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.
no I am serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you.
oh no-no, i can not do that.
okay.
so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, we are on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.
no, he visited a little town south of throw up. (monica laughs hysterically.) so what was phoebe’s secret?
that is it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?
(angrily) did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!
what about him?
let me see this guy. (phoebe hands him the picture.) w-h-wow! do not show this to monica! and do not tell her about the w-h-wow!
hey.
oh it is always nicer to here than, "aw crap! you again!"
hey.
oh yeah?
did you not understand the story?
hey! what is up?
huh.
no! (the oven dings.) shhh!
nancy thompson’s getting fired! (monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
i had too okay?! we are getting married! married couples can not keep secrets from one another!
du-ude!
did you not hear me say, "du-ude?!"
in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
you want to tell secrets?! okay! okay! in college, ross used to wear leg warmers!
ross came in forth and cried!
(to monica) of course it is. (mouths to ross) wow—whoa!
hey!!!
that was you!
(to monica) you have no trouble telling time now right?
quick! what time is it?! (holds his watch in front of her face.)
y’know when i said that because we are getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
yeah that was stupid. let us not do that.
yeah, and not that you would, but i would not hang out with…all the guys in my office.
yeah, i do not know why we hang out with married couples more often.
you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like you would not have done it. (she shrugs)
a dinosaur died a million years ago?
you never did it!
hey! i will have you know that... aah, who am i kidding. let us call the kid geller and let bing die with me.
mrs hannigan?
hey joe! we have got a couple of things we have got to check out at the new house. you want to come with us?
yeah, come with us. you will see how close it is to the city.
damn it.
that is what we were going to name the baby.
hey, how did the interview go?
you know, i always feel that way after an interview. I will bet it went better than you think.
that is a bad interview.
ooh! israeli champagne. and it is vanilla!
to ross!
and thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I have already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
what?
when your head was hanging out the window, it did not hit a mailbox, did it?
man, those two dogs are going at it!
hey.
really? what changed your mind?
joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
ha! I am just messing with you.
you do not think we would buy a house and not have a joey room do you?
it is seven years ago. (he looks surprised) my time machine works!
excuse me?
for your information, i was staring at her baby. we are about to be parents.
how did the job stuff go?
that is great!
huh. (they all leave, dejected)
morning.
yeah, like there is any way i could ever do that.
hey, you know what, here is a thought. why do not you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
i can not believe that i am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I am such a grown up.
well, maybe i will not kiss you, and then you will have to stay.
nope, not this time.
I am not yanking you.
yeah, i know. she makes me happy.
(looks him in the eye) I am not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then joey blows in his face)
hey!
of!
you know, you should really go on this show. all right, listen, i got three tickets to the rangers tonight. what did ya' say?
no, janice.
you know, i may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with janice?
ooh, that girl that i hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
well, there you go.
well, I am crazy about her now. i think this could be the real thing. capital 'r'! capital 't'! (joey stares at him) do not worry, those are the right letters.
i want you to say that you like her!
thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) oh, and by the way there is no count rushmore!
umm, yeah.
girth? why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
we are not going to talk about girth are we?
yeah, okay.
yeah! all right! you go first.
okay.
princess leia in the gold bikini.
i know!
okay.
okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
and, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. and you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like elle macpherson, or that girl at the xerox place....
i know, and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head. and your like 'mom, get outta here!' you know, but of course, like, after that you can not possibly think of anything else, and you can not, you know, stop what your doing. so it is kind of like, you are, you know. you know...(ross just stares at him). you do not know!
you said...
what are you guys doing together?
really.
you still can not stand her can you?
well, you know, i appreciate you giving it a shot.
well, i guess that is something.
okay.
oh god!
really?
hi, my name’s chandler. i just moved in next door and i was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
so, is janine around?
can i check out what she did to my room?
(the room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) oh my god. what is th… it is like a guy never lived in here. look, you have got to be careful. this girl thing is dangerous. (looking around the living room.) it is spreading already.
(picking up a pillow.) yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
(pointing to the table and picking up the box.) is that your tiny little box, that is too small to put anything in?
no! ok, this is not good. you are a guy. ok? this is a guys place. if you let this go, you are going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
yes talk to her. be a man.
defend yourself.
be right there sweetums. (monica leaves. to joey.) a totally different situation.
hey, how was your breakfast with hillary?
ohh, yeah.
that is weird. i do not think my boss likes me either.
yeah let us head off to work.
you know…oh my god.
(sarcastically) really.
yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.
no, no no no. you will be fine. (turning to monica) hillary’s bind, right?
yeah. (rachel walks in.)
what???
i am proud of all my friends today.
hi, I am chandler. your live-in boy
oh, i am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (phoebe walks in.)
yes, god forbid we throw out old underwear. you-you know what? I am going to go over to joey’s.
yes, but i feel like I have really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. you know. in fact i think we are two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
nah, nah, it is okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing.
you know when guys hang out they do not just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
no thanks, josephine.
hey ross, i was wondering if… oh my god!! where are all the men???
monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
what is the matter with you ?!?
you are arranging flowers! (pointing to the dish on the table.) you got dead flowers! you got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! this is not joey!!
you are turning into a women.
now I have upset you? what did i say?
(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!
oh, i can not believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
hi.
oh, damn it!
is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we do not think we would want you to be our child! (dr. connelly glares at him) wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
(entering) hey guys!
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
but you come first!
(sitting down on the couch) ok.
not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you are giving a sperm sample.
well... there is surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
yeah.
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we are talking about sperm donors.
(stopping joey) ah-ha!
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i do not think there is one.
hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!
you guys have not actually met before, but, boy! you are both polite! (pause) go to have a seat zack, and I will get you a beer.
(to mon) so, zack's pretty nice, uh?
so, how would you like to have a baby that is half yours and half his!
well, we are talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he is intelligent, he is healthy, he is athletic, i mean, he is "spermtastic"!
no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
I am telling you, he is great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I would think he would be the way to go!
ok!
(bringing the beer to zack) zack!
so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!
you do not like him.
alright! just follow my lead!
oh! thanks, I am crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
(very seriously) that is really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.
you know what is not funny? male pattern baldness (monica stretches her neck to look behind zack's head and then gives chandler an "ok" sign)
i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?
(proceeding with his dinner) we are teeth people zack!
you sure you do not want to stick around a little longer?
are you just tired now or are you always tired, because that could be a sign of clinical depression.
ok.
i think we have found our sperm!
yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?
why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are going to get that from you anyway!
yeah, he is better!
really? are you sure?
(sighs with relief) thank god, because i do not want to do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, I am the husband, I am supposed to... bring the sperm.
so you know this leaves us with...
how do you feel about that?
me too. i want to find a baby that needs a home and i want to raise it with you. and i want to mess it up in our own specific way.
(smiling) yeah.
we are going to be great parents.
wait, if we are lucky, and we are really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
hey, zack!
look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
really?
my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we are working on it.
you would not know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
wow! that ripped! that ripped real nice!
you do not turn and slide, you throw it out! I am tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time i get dressed!
all right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.
(nods his head) do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to joey) they seem all right with it!
uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
(reading the ad) stunning entertainment center. fine, (pause) fine italian craftsmanship. (joey is very proud of himself)
you want it?
ahh, gepeto, $5,000 dollars? are you insane?
all right look, I am changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
(looks at him) nooo.
i can not believe you do not know what i do for a living!
(interrupting) let it go!!
yes, joey has a very careful screening process. apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
you will have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
y'know, i, i really do not think we need a canoe.
all right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
y'know what, i think this might be one of the times he is wrong.
oh-no, he is right.
I am coming already!!
oh my god!!!
are you all right?!
(let us him out) what happened?!!
what the hell happened?!! how were you locked in?!! and where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
so—you got in voluntarily?!
bend over?!!!
oh, umm, joey was born, and then 28 years later, i was robbed!!
oh, they said uh, “you do not have insurance here, so stop calling us.”
pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we would really appreciate it. (joey nods in agreement)
what did i marry into?
you guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
(to monica) I am leaving you.
who?
(looking around) did i go to this school?
(looks over at her) sure, nice.
you are right, by saying "nice" I am virtually licking her.
are you asking permission to break the pact?
awesome, the name really stands out.
man, we are going to rock that asian student union!
hey!
you know, our band is playing on friday.
fresh!
mint!
i know it. you know, I am totally going to ask her out.
i said it first, bro.
(angrily) look, if you did...
totally. i had sex in high school...
all right, I would say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.
all right, so that is missy goldberg, phoebe cates and molly ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
oh, and sheena easton. but we probably could not get her anyway.
well, i officially give you permission to break the pact.
your hands are shaking.
(to the two guys) excuse me. (chandler and ross move away from them). that did not make us sound gay at all!
ross, that was 16 years ago!
i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (ross just stares at him) all right, look, if we are really going to do this... it is not like you never broke one of the pacts.
oh really?
oh really!?
adrienne turner!! (a girl behind them turns around)
oh please, and you knew how much i liked her.
really?
are not you...?
(smiling at monica) right. (to rachel) so how are you doing?
hi monica.
of-kay. I will see if i can find ross. (goes off to find ross.)
well, i did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) that is when i wrote the song: "betrayal in the common room".
look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-of-ong time ago.
(smiling a little nervously) hmm mmmhm..
(sighs) just one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night that i wanted to get back at you. so i thought, who does ross like the more than anybody?
not her!
soo... you girls having fun?
well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
so where are you applying to?
I am in college and I am in a band.
yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it does not matter.
why?
you kissed her that night too?
seriously, where did this happen?
oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?
I am pretty sure i put her on my bed.
why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
what did i marry into?
what are you crazy? that is a baby!
hey, you are going to be fine. you are one of the most caring, most responsible men in north america. you are going to make a great dad.
well, only if you order stuff.
there it is! so what are you going to do?
and your friend phoebe?
man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you would be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
alright, what have we learned so far?
(reading) "happy birthday peehe."
did you see betty?
okay, worst case scenario. say you never feel like a father.
say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this.
you know, you think i would.
what is up with the simian?
okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
no, no, you got zero points for 'idney'.
marcel swallowed a scrabble tile.
we think he was trying to spell out 'monkey.'
(tapping ross on his shoulder) so, you feel like a dad yet?
hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad.
�pudo aver sido general tso! (it could have been general sal!)
hi!
we are just here to say goodbye, we are off to ohio.
and so incorrect!
uhm, thank you, but we are really trying not to get our hopes up.
yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word.
so we are standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
yes, but...
oh, screw it, I am going to be a daddy!!
yeah. just weird, you know. it is like: "hi, I am chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?"
you are going to be great.
thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
ok.
that is what our friends call us.
(astonished) i do not think that is exactly...
so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that is important to you?
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
yeah, wow.
no-ot for me it does not.
yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
you should be. you are really on top of stuff..
yeah, i did.
we are not signing those papers.
it is wrong. they made a mistake. they think we are somebody else.
you have got to stop!
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.
your veal chop is $34,95!
but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?
i know..
oh, honey..
monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it is going to.
so, we will tell the truth and who knows, maybe she will like us for us.
you are jewish.
hey.
the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and I am not a doctor.
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you would like.
well, our names really are monica and chandler. we are from new york.
erica wait!
you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we have been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we do not know how long it is going to be before we can get another chance again.
erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and I am in advertising.
but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she is loving and devoted and caring. and do not tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can not give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, I will learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she is already there. she is a mother... without a baby... please?
you still want that baby?
(to monica) yeah, see, i can not pull of baby-doll can i?
okay.
hiya doing pumpkin?
(terrified) right, because it is fast. because, it is so fast. it is fast!
oh! good for you pheebs, way to go! (breathes a sigh of relief)
so, what are you going to do?
me?! why me?
I will try, but I am not sure what good it would do, y'know? because I am a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be.
(to phoebe, behind monica's back) still terrified, I will take care of it. no problem. (when monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he will do it to phoebe.)
hey ladies! what are you in here for? (laughs at his joke.)
gary, I am here to report a crime.
it is a crime that you and i do not spend more time together.
well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me.
uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are going to be y'know, live-living together!
you mean scared.
scared? happy?
i am trying to open your eyes, my man! do not you see, if you lived with phoebe she is always going to be there. you are going to get home, she is there. you go to bed, she is there. you wake up and oh yes, she is there!
were you are parents happy, or something?
wow, y'know when you say it, it does not sound so scary.
yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica!
(pause) yeah, you are right about that.
hi!
yes i did, and i think you should do it.
he is a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
I am sorry. (pause) if you ask me, I would move in with him.
hey gar!
four hours? you guys have been doing this for four hours?
all right, let me in. (he jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
what?
I am not a dropper!
it is throwing and catching!
oh! oh! that is so hard. (starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to monica.)
maybe that is because she is a minion of the anti-christ.
yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
not fun anymore?
come on! gary's such a great guy! whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
oh that is over!
you guys want to eat here?
y'know, how did i get this reputation as a dropper? okay? I am anything but a dropper. (we see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I am not going to describe them, you will have to see them.)
hey man, what is up?
yeah, yeah! me too!
yeah.
well, i like danger.
tonight? you-you did not say it was going to be at nighttime.
it is starting to get dark out there.
(laughing) okay. (deadpan) but it is officially nighttime.
your tax dollars?
(leans in and takes a sniff of joey's sandwich) wow! that sandwich really does smell good.
i can not smell your sandwich?
okay, I will give them back. (exhales strongly through his nose and joey just glares at him.) look! what is so great about that sandwich?
okay.
yeah.
sur-surprise him? we are not, we are not going to make anybody mad are we?
how do you figure that?
y'know, when you say partner it does not sound cop. it, it sounds gay.
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors.
okay, y'know, we-we are safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down!
(deadpan) oh, hurry up. i want to sign that.
what is going on?
uh, hello!!
(pouting) it was a car backfire!
who jumps at loud noises!
yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think I will go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (he gets up and starts for the door.)
(returning) oh my god! (storms out.)
oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever…
no. no I am just tired. y'know, from-from the walk.
you dove in front of ross! ross!
i do not hate ross!
what picture?
look I am very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could have been a bullet and you y'know, you did not try to save me!
when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that is the bottom line.
from a bullet!
much sense?!
so you risked your life, for a sandwich!
so you did not uh, choose ross before me.
really?!
thanks. (he grabs the sandwich.)
(with his mouthful) oh-oi-ho, yeah!
hm-hmm. (goes to take another bite.)
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
before or after you were shot by your own troops?
yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
oh totally! (holds up his finger.) pull my finger.
okay. well, i think the centerpieces are too big
kind of. they are really big.
what?
no. no, see when i first meet somebody it is uh it is mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I am afraid even more sweating.
i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (monica laughs.) look, for me the rush is knowing that we are going to be together for the rest of our lives.
well yeah! but now that i know that you are having these thoughts, I am back to panic, anxiety, and uh I am definitely going to need some kind of sports drink.
(hoarsely) water! water! water!
mr. millionaire, new from snooty playthings! third wife sold separately.
life-sized imperial storm troopers from sharper image?
wow!! can joey and i put them on and fight?
yeah, either that, or gloria estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
it is possible. you are very loveable, I would miss you if i broke up with you. (ross glares at him) i was just trying to be supportive.
(in a deep voice) if i broke up with you, I would miss you.
and you are our age. you are our age.
that is not a state joe.
you are our age!
i can blow dry it. i can put gel on it. it does not matter, i still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. it is so annoying. does it bug you?
is there any chance you did not see that?
ross! you got to stop! okay?! you can not just stare through the peep hole for three hours! you are going to get peep eye!
you did not just break up.
you slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. i mean bullets have left guns slower!
okay.
and the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
stop what?!
no!! you can not!!
i am your friend, and i am not going to let you do this!! (ross is now dragging chandler and the foosball table to the door) you are surprisingly strong!
look man!
listen to me!! (chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
she is moving on! okay, if it is not this guy, it is going to be somebody else! and unless you are thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! okay, man? it is over.
okay.
i know. (he rubs ross’s head)
i do not think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (he blows on his hand) draw!! (he quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a western.)
(to joey) i was not doing anything. (joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) uh-oh, what did she do now?
ah, sliced bread, a wonderful lady macbeth.
i think somebody has a crush on somebody.
I am talking about you. you big, big freak.
hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! if you were in a school yard you would be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
‘because it is-it is not his last name.
no, it is not like, like phil spiderman. he is a spider, man. y'know like ah, like goldman is a last name, but there is no gold man.
so, ahh, what kind of powers would gold man have?
what about things that are already gold?
okay, let us play my game now.
pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for monica? i can not figure this out! it is so hard! should i get her a (turning to each page) tiffany cut or a princess cut or a—ah-ah! paper cut!
no, i do not want to tell anybody else because i do not want monica to find out.
well, it is because i trust you, you are one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when i was looking at ring brochures.
me too.
hey.
oh all right.
oh well, we do not because we got…the…other pl-place.
nothin! this is the nine millionth ring store we have been too and i can not find the perfect ring! (goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) ugly ring! ugly ring! ugly ring! (notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) it is a beautiful selection. (the jeweler walks away slowly.)
y’know, I am so glad i picked you to help me with this.
yeah, I am going to stick with the ring. (goes to another display counter.) oh, this one’s nice! (pointing to another ring.) i like this one! sir? uh, kind sir? can i see this one?
uh-uh, yes. i would like to see that ring please.
sir, can i ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
(choking up) oh my god that is it, that is the ring! how much is it?
yes! yes, but i can only pay $8,000.
uh, credit card. (reaches for it then realizes) oh no! no-no, but i left my credit card with joey. (to phoebe) okay, I will go get it. you guard the ring.
no. how are ya paul? (starts to look for his credit card.)
no, did he hug you?!
well, you can see my dad in vegas kissing other dads.
yeah?
I am a little busy here paul.
okay, a quick one. come on hug it out. (paul rushes over and hugs chandler tightly.) oh hey! there you go. (the hug continues.) okay. (the hug continues.)
okay! (pushes him away.)
do you have my credit card?
thank god! (grabs his card.)
oh, i can not go.
oh, that is uh, that is pretty nice but I am going to go with the one i picked first.
what?
they put you in jail?
phoebe, i asked you to guard the ring!
yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring i got goose bumps.
it was the ring!
i can not believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
no, it is not! when i looked at the other ring i could see monica’s face when i gave it to her, y’know? and i could see her saying yes. when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring! unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye. (does so and laughs.) look, this is the most important thing I am going to do in my life. i want to make sure it is perfect.
i can not do that.
okay and he has not proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
yeah! okay, go, go, go get him.
(to him) hi! hi. okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you are about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. so, I am going to need to have that back. (the guy is not sure.) but, in exchange I am willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (looking at the ring.) ew.
no-no! this is my fiancee (phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. you do not want to break her heart now do you?
yeah, she is dying… of a cough apparently.
(interrupting her) okay, that is enough honey!
great! okay, here. (holds the ring up for him.)
thank you. thank you. thank you! (to his girlfriend) and you are about to marry a wonderful man! (she stunned and he is horrified.) hey! I am marrying a dead woman!
guys? (they ignore him.) I have got something important to tell ya. (still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the tv.) guys? (they lean over to try and watch the tv, chandler mimics them.) guys?! (pause) I am going to ask monica to marry me.
yeah, check out the ring. (shows it to them.)
yep, pretty much.
(goes to hug him and stops short) heyyyy—what?
okay! (they hug.) i was going to wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? but i got so excited i just had to tell you guys because you are my best friends.
I am going to ask monica to marry me.
i know.
check out the ring.
well, she walked in when i was looking at the ring brochures. you can understand that, right? (ross and joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on tv.) guys? guys? (walks in front of them again.)
that is funny. it was also funny when i made it up.
i made that joke up.
yes, i did. i told it to dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he would ever heard.
monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
seriously?
yeah, i guess.
(jumping up from his chair) hey, joey, playboy printed my joke.
it is my joke.
dude, you have got to turn on behind the music. the band heart is having a really tough time, and i think they may break up.
nah, monica’s watching some cooking show. come on, i do not want to miss when they were skinny.
what? no, i want to watch this. (he turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). did your cable go out?
joey, why is your cable out?
if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
whoa ho.
(picks up the phone) all right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
(with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) paid your phone bill?
yeah.
so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
and monkeys can not write out prescriptions.
(stops laughing, to ross) you are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
yeah!
okay (he goes to sit down).
(visibly upset) he took my joke, he took it.
you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? I am going to get a joke journal. y’know? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
yeah!
picking rachel.
maybe it is the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
so is your apron. you are wearing it like a cape.
i think it is great that you work here. you are going to make a lot of money, and here is your first tip: do not eat yellow snow. (he laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at ross, and writes in his journal). ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
it is my joke.
let us have monica decide.
yeah!
mon, get out here!
okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is.
because you are the only one that can be fair.
(to ross) do not try to sway her. (to monica) (softly) I am your only chance to have a baby. okay, let us go.
okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.
can i finish my story?!
so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steve’s doctor’s name is doctor muppy. so i said, ‘doctor monkey?’ and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. (he slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)
I am not arguing with that.
is not.
hi, oh hi.
(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (pause.) being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(he falters and monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.
(to chandler) I am out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?
(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) you are a little high maintenance.
I am sorry. you are not easy-going, but you are passionate, and that is good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that I am pretty good about making you feel better about that. and that is good too. so, they can say that you are high maintenance, but it is okay, because i like … maintaining you.
(happily) I am off the list. (sits on the couch.)
hey, buddy boy, how did the audition go?
hey.
joey! (pause as they all stare at him.) no way. I am not answering that.
so, where is mike?
hey.
why are you wearing my apron?
oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if i introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who is carrying my child"? (she is not amused) no? divorce?
oh, those places! there is always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there is always some idiot who goes "mooooo"!
I am so sorry...
monica. calm, self.
why would you say that?
great! (to monica) this baby'd better to be really good.
(enters the room wearing an "i love new york" t-shirt, a "statue of liberty" hat and carrying bags) new york is awesome!
yeah, I have been to these places before, but I have never really seen them, you know.
oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
that is great.
so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too?
I will bet his dad does not think so.
of course I am awake. assume from now on that I am always awake! (he turns the light on)
honey, it is us. of course it is the shovel-killer.
I would keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is.
i dunno, are not there tests for these things, right?
pff, easy for you to say, he is a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he is probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
hey! how was lunch?
(struggling) oh, really?
of-okay. (steps closer to monica and speaks softly) so, is she going to take the test?
oh god. it is shovely-joe, is not it?
how do you know?
oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
(nods in appreciation) shovely joe!
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
sure i would!
what, you guys really think that I am that shallow?
what if i had had the guts to quit my job? I would probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my job’s fun too! i mean tomorrow, i-i do not have to wear a tie.
(entering, depressed) hey.
oh i just got another rejection letter. they said my writing was funny, just not "archie comic funny."
was his question what is more boring than him?
hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride.
ehh.
i could use the money; it could give me time to write.
okay!
all right!
hey.
well it is kind of hard to be friends with drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he is not real.
uh-oh, it is my boss!
(reading the list) drop off my dry cleaning. pick up my vitamins. teach me how to spell vitamins. wear in my new jeans.
what?
but the kit-kats are all right?!
phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
i always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (phoebe glares at him.) but you are not going to die. i mean, you are going to die, but you are not going to die today. i wish i was dead.
oh just great. he beeps me now with codes. one is, "bring me food." two is, "I am with a girl, bring us food." three is, "I am lost and i can not find food."
(approaching) here you go joe, here is the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (hands it to him.)
yeah?
I am sorry, i guess i just like the pulp.
okay, anything for you sir?
it is not all juice! (rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
who sold a story to archie comics?!
aww.
you want to share it?
what is this?
aww, thanks man. (they hug.)
oh you would not uh, care. it is just a stupid comic book story.
well uh, archie needs money to fix his jalopy (joey laughs), uh but he does not want reggie to just give him the money. so reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. and then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can not have lumps in them.
no, the doctors say it may kill her.
(to ross) but i think we should tell her.
listen phoebe, he is right. people are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
uh, what about y’know the massage thing? that never gave you a heart attack.
I am sorry you are here with me instead of roger.
well, i could make it seem like he is here. (imitates him.) "here is some little known facts about cous-cous. they did not add the second cous until 1979." (mumbles something further.)
okay.
what was tonight?
okay. (pause.) what was tonight?
with roger? (monica shyly looks away.) not just with roger?! (monica shrugs.) oh my god!
four different women! I have had sex way more times!
nine.
well good, good for you. you really think that roger is the perfect guy?
hey that is what i tell girls about me.
no you are not! you are sweet and wonderful and this is going to happen for you.
okay. (they both realize what he just said.)
so was i.
we can not do this.
yeah! (takes it.) if-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? because you have been waiting a very long time and i would not want to disappoint you.
i do like that.
well, if it helps there were only three. so it would just be for tonight, right?
stop it! we are doing this! let us do it!
okay! (they both get up.)
i have some moves.
yeah, let us just forget it.
okay!
oh yeah.
(sexily) yeah?
oh my god!
oh, okay! (he rolls over to do that again.)
hey!
let me tell you about this chick i scored with last night! oh no wait a minute that was you!
so you uh, want to do something tonight?
oh. oh right! right! because you are still seeing him and uh, he is a good guy. i mean, i remember a time when… (he fakes falling asleep.)
yeah! totally! totally, and you?
i bet he can.
oh yeah! yeah! do not worry about me, I will be fine! (does a kara-tay move.)
(sticking his head in the door) okay to come in?
yeah i know, guess who beeped him?
I am the ruptured spleen. (laughs.)
because you should not be with him. (pause.) you should be with me.
yeah! when you were talking about roger, that was killing me! look, things like last night they do not just happen. y’know? or at least not to me. or with the other two women, in the morning y’know i was just lying there and i could not wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you i always y’know with a friend.
i know you probably do not want to go out with me, y’know because i make too many jokes and I have never been in a serious relationship and i guess I am not technically a "doctor…"
no, there were two.
oh yeah.
any contact?
come on, ross, you got to get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—i do not think we need a third...
i think it is winning.
she will love it. go with the egg, my friend.
no, it is suicide. the man's got an egg.
oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a...
yes! way to go, man! (chandler and ross hug. something crunches in ross' shirt pocket.) still got the egg, huh?
oh, uh, i... do not... care. (joey's date shows up) ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess.
...and what did you bring?
janice?
(angrily) hey, it is janice.
ok, I am makin' a break for it, I am going out the window.
calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that I have dumped twice in the last five months!
I am sorry, I am sorry, you are right. (gets up right behind joey and yells in his ear) come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
that is ok.
(disgusted) what? what can not you do?
tell me it is "you and me" we.
ok, you can not do this to me.
i hope she throws up on you.
so...
oh, what a crappy night!
excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) how ya doing?
joey's not a friend. he is...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert? a big screen tv?
you got it. good woman! (the waiter turns around, it is a man) could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
that is right, each. oh, and a uh rob roy. (to janice) I have always wanted to know...
no... no! and yet it did. good-bye, janice.
ok, well, this was very special.
janice is going to go away now.
oh, good, joey's home now.
how can i dump this woman on valentine's day?
oh, man. in my next life, I am coming back as a toilet brush.
hi, just janice.
is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) chan and jan forever.
ok, janice. janice. hey, janice. look, there is no way for me to tell you this. at least there is no new way for me to tell you this. i just do not things are going to work out.
(surprised) it is?
oh no, you see, actually it is.
oh, no i do not.
i did, but...
call me!
okay. (he picks the 9 of spades)
oh yes.
(pause) yes.
hi there!
that.
hey rach, now that you are working at ralph lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
dude! that is my girlfriend!
weirder than watching his two moms make out? (monica nods in agreement.)
yeah, it is the best.
yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
yeah, i want to go to babe.
ah sure. what is in  them?
oh good, because uh we got rachel 800 gallons of water.
y'know i rued the day once…did not get a whole lot else done.
(shocked) well i mean, let me get the door first. (goes and opens the door.) oh, hi! no one. (exits.)
okay, there is something different though--oh my god! you smoked!
yes you did! you look happy and sick; you smoked!
i wish i had smoked for my career…
okay, but you got to push past this because it is about to get so good!
i think you smell great! (he sniffs her shoulder.)
great job with the cups, pheebs!
awesome!
there are snow cones! (monica glares at him.) snow cones! yuck!
thank you! thank you! (runs to the snow cone machine.)
(to kim and nancy) oh, hi! excuse me, is uh rachel green here? i was supposed to meet her for lunch.
okay, great.
I will catch you guys later. (exits.)
that is right.
oh no.
okay.
hey! you okay?
did he just say, he loves fonzie?
all right…
yeah, that is when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
really? male nurses?
so they are going on dates? when?
this-this fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
all right.
(spotting her) oh-hey-hey-hey! there you are!
oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? yeah, joey already told me, and i am so-so fine. i mean, you and i we are just, y'know, we are nothing, we are goofin' around.
fine! maybe i will too!
so dan, nurse not a doctor huh? kind of girlie is not it?
oh.
sure. (pause) and listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (retreats in defeat.)
(to another female nurse) hey, how 'bout it? you, me, saturday night?
all right. very good.
bye, momi-moo.
yes!
oh god, kindergarten flashback.
okay, keep saying it!
so, are you really going to go out with that nurse man?
y'know, i do not know if you have ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am so bad at this.
really? okay, so…
y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we are okay?
right!
so uh, now that little chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they going to name her?
that is kind of a masculine name, do not you think?
okay, she is the star of the play. and she is my girlfriend! i get to have sex with the star of the play!
i know!!
wow! she looks great. does not she?
is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
yeah, it is like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
I am totally screwed. okay, they are going to be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they are going to go to their cast parties and he is going to try to undermine me. y'know it will be like, "so where is your boyfriend, what is-his-name, chester?" and she will go, "no-no-no, it is chandler." and he will go, "whatever. ha-ha-ha-ha!"
all right, look, look, what am i going to do?
really?
so uh, man, are you going to go to the play with me tonight?
yeah, i know but…
okay, okay, but do not worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which I am fairly certain are the same thing.
I am right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now there is no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means!
come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly you are having sex with him.
oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!
y’know, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know you are up there every night, you are naked, touching, kissing.
well, you can understand, given how we started.
well, that is what happened, and i do not even see you denying this!
yeah, well, do not expect that to happen anytime soon!
steps! (he opens the door to his apartment to ross and joey looking at the new playboy) slut! (ross and joey quickly hide the playboy behind their backs. chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy!
i confronted her, and she did not deny it! (pause) i do not live here! (goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
well, i may be drunk, but i know what she said! then i went over to beefsteak julie’s…
yes! see you and i have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)
did she call?
all right, maybe i should call her.
well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if i was wrong?
well y'know, what if she did not actually sleep with the guy?
she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. back me up here, ross!
that is not backing me up! look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
oh my god!!
hey. i just, i just wanted to come over to-to say that I am sorry. y’know? i know i acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and i can completely understand why you were so upset.
yeah, i know, i-i wish i had too, but y’know i-i think this is a good thing. y'know? ‘because we have had our first fight, and now we can move on. y’know, i know for me—(notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) nick’s pants?
yeah. well, i think our second fight is going to be a big one!
well, she was not sleeping with him.
she is now.
I am saying that she… is a devil woman! y’know i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick! nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! i hate him, i hate her! well, i do not hate her, i love her. this is all my fault really.
because, i-i should have called! y’know if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would have gone out with nick, and they would have ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples!
hey.
(shocked) yes! yes! a thousand times, yes!
oh, it is awkward. it is awkward. it is awkward.
you can be the best man when i get married.
oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
I am not even getting married! okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
I am not even… I am not even…
(entering) hey guys, what are you doing?
yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
oh, I am ross. I am ross. I am too good for the hut; I am too good for the hut.
see ya. (ross exits, and chandler moves over next to joey, laughing.) have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
he just said, "no strippers."
(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I have decided that my best man is, my best friend gunther!
central perk?
(banging on the bottle again) okay, okay, a little announcement, i just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! and uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.
(opening the door) what?
ugh. just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—ah-ha-ha!! you lost the ring! you are the worst best man ever!
you slept with the stripper?
hey!
so you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (gives joey a little squeeze.)
so you might say, it is a magic ring.
well, i think it all started when you said, "hey joey, why do not you be my best man."
well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
(to ross) you be cool. (he opens the door and let us her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
way to be cool, man.
marry me. (both ross and chandler hit him.)
he will, joe.
hey, come on, it is not your fault.
no, you should.
really?
thanks man.
what a baby.
it could have been worse, he could have shot her.
hey.
oh wow, i hope you do not take this the wrong way but, i know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I am just kind of worried about what it might do to our friendship.
seven times!
in a foreign, romantic country…
bad london! (takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
well, i do not see that we have a choice. but, when we are back home, we do not do it.
y’know, i saw a wine cellar downstairs…
okay!
forget it, that is off.
the man’s got a point.
listen, in the middle of everything if i scream the word, "yippee!" just ignore me.
oh, hello rachel.
yes, we do. but, we have to change first.
yeah, we will be down in like five minutes.
oh, yay…
(to monica) hey, listen, why do not we go change in my room?
wow, you look…
well, I have got a girl in here.
well, we are-we are hanging out in here!
well, i suppose I would have to say you!! but, what if we are watching a movie in here?
well, ross and emily are not going to use it.
oh mon-mon-mon-mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. the room expects sex. the room would be disappointed if it did not get sex. all of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
okay!
nope, not under here!
well, you could not have looked everywhere or else you would have found her!
yeah, for about 30 minutes.
wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (monica smiles at that.)
yeah, we are going to go.
yeah, it is a very large plane.
but, we will stay here with you.
we have to leave for new york in an hour.
we can not do that that is insane. i mean ‘a’ he could wake up and ‘b’ y’know, let us go for it.
yeah, it kind of makes that-that one night special. (realizes something) y’know, technically we still are over international waters.
‘kay!
uhh, no.
no.
yes.
okay man. (chandler starts to get up.)
hey!
no we did not!
yes! good thing we have that, ‘not in new york’ rule.
right.
oh. y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it was not because i was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘because, you are really hot! is that okay?
and I am cute too.
thank you! (they hug.) all right, i got to go unpack.
bye.
(entering) I am still on london time, does that count?
oh, good! (they start kissing.)
mrs. tedlock. you are looking lovely today. and may i say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
oh, listen. if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them. really. nothing at all. really. (chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) nothing.
hey!
so, it is a typical day at work. I am inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
so.... i quit.
why? this was supposed to be a temp job!
if i took this promotion, it would be like admitting that this is what i actually do.
it does not matter. i just do not want to be one of those guys that is in his office until twelve of the clock at night worrying about the wenus.
weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term.
i do not know. that is the thing. i do not know what i want to do. i just know I am not going to figure it out working there.
yeah... i just do not have that much cheffing experience. unless it is an all-toast restaurant.
thanks, phoebe. but i just do not really see myself in a big white hat.
can you see my nipples through this shirt?
well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) i added the "a-gogo."
hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. you know, you have goals. you have dreams. i do not have a dream.
was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
who are you going out with?
and he is not speaking metaphorically.
eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do i learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "you are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
can you believe it? i mean, do not i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? you know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something.
ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so I would better split this with you.
(tastes it) well.... it is amouz-ing...
you know, i do not mean to brag, but i waited tables at innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
(smiling)....with??
it is ok. it is ok. i was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
again?
(on phone) hey mr. kostelic! how is life on the fifteenth floor? (listens) yeah, i miss you too. (listens) yeah, it is a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (listens) well, that is very generous (listens) er, but look, this is not about the money. i need something that is more than a job. i need something i can really care about.... (listens) and that is on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (listens) look, al, al... I am not playing hardball here, ok? this is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (listens) no! no! no, stop saying numbers! I am telling you, you have got the wrong guy! you have got the wrong guy! (listens) I will see you on monday! (slams the phone down)
well?
look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of new york city)
yes indeedy! (they look outside) with a beautiful view of...
(walks away from window) ok, that is enough of the view. check this out, look at this. sit down, sit down.
this is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) helen, could you come in here for a moment?
thank you helen, that will be all.
last time i do that, i promise.
(on phone) yes, fran. i know what time it is, but I am looking at the wenus and I am not happy!... (listens) oh, really, really, really? well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because i care about it! you got it? good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) whooooaaaa....
(to the front desk clerk) hi! we are checking out of the bridal suite.
and I am the happiest guy in the world! (monica goes and sits down in a huff.) oh honey, come on do not be upset. we still have so much to look forward to!
we got the honeymoon.
the wedding pictures?
not the disposable cameras from the tables.
I will tell you what, i will go get them developed and you can go home.
what? what did you take a picture of?
okay ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
oh.
okay, well I am going to get ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (joey laughs again.) 32 joe. you are 32! (exits)
hey. (he sees that ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) soaps? shampoos? are you really taking all this stuff?
yeah but you do not need—(picks up something)—what is this?
score! where are the disposable cameras?
the cameras? remember last night i told you to take them?
yes! remember? right before we cut the cake, i went up to you and i said…
so you do not have the cameras?!
so? what? what? they are gone! monica’s going to freak!
great.
hey! did you find the cameras?
yes! and that is why I am under the table. celebrating.
well this is great. y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was going to cheer monica up today, she is really depressed.
all my energy is going into not asking that question. i can not believe i screwed this up!
are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
are you serious?
marriage advice? really?!
i do not know, monica picked out the flowers.
she picked those out too.
that was her.
i was in charge of the cameras! gift shop?
(to another couple) uh, excuse me? could you take a picture of us?
uhh… yeah sure. (holds the camera up to his face.) click!
oh yeah. I will take, I will take your picture. (he takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
who are you? ansel adams?! get outta here!
why do not you go up on stage. I will get a picture of you doing the speech.
okay, you ready for the last picture?
get ready to run. (chandler walks over to the new bride.) congratulations on your wedding. (he grabs her, kisses her, ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)
we are back!
it is picture time.
(showing her the pictures) here is a picture of ross. (shows another one.) and that is me. (another one.) and that is me and ross. (another one.) oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
eh?
okay, so this is not a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. which by the look on your face I am sure you will remember. so we do not need—(rips the picture)—there is no need to have this picture. how about i take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
okay. (sees the living room.) you opened all the presents without me?! i thought we were supposed to do that together!
call it even?!
y’know when we move in together, can i get a gumball machine?
no. when it comes to sweets, he is surprisingly strict.
no, no, i keep trying, y’know? i can get out, "joey, i have too…" but then i lose my nerve and i always finish with, "…go to the bathroom." he may think I am sick.
oh, so that is this is going to work now? you are just going to order me around all the time?
all right.
no-of-of! (to monica) no? (she nods no.) no-of-of! look joey, here is the thing, monica and i have decided to live together, here. so, I am going to be moving out man.
look, i-I am just going to be right across the hall and i promise you, the minute monica and i break up I am moving right back in with you!
(entering) hey!
(looking down) what gave me away?
okay, so that is it, everybody knows! it is official, we are moving in together. no turning back. are ya scared? are ya?
wow that was my scariest voice! you are very brave.
hey.
hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me sha-la-lap. (awkward silence ensues.) seriously.
well, i-i still think you are very-very nice and very pretty…
(to monica) all yours babe. (walks away.)
rach…
okay, when are we going to tell rachel what is actually going to happen?
well, joey’s my best friend.
you just said… of course you are my best friend. would you please tell rachel though?
okay. (she grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) oh yes. (he reaches for one.)
hey-hey!
i am now!
okay, bye! (exits.)
look, I am just going to be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
not once did we do that.
hey!
oh yeah? well, how did she take it?
and you are upset because you did not make your best friend cry?
okay, i got to ask, who calls us that?!
yeah, because if i was at my old job we would say 300 million? no thank you!

yes but there is six of us so we would only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
(looking around at the others)I will ask. (to ross) boohaki?

well you would not, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
ok, so now that you are in, what are you going to do if we win?
ooh! calm down ...

yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago.
honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
(to mon) she is right, you should not have bought tickets just for us ...
let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it does not look like I am going to get this job so i can not afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from rachel)
oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!

(smiling, surprised) oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) listen, do not tell monica, she will rip your heart right out.
wow, you would think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
me too.
(to joey) so uh, what is this thing you are auditioning for?
that is lucky.
now-now, why would you say that joseph?
 whoa, she is pretty. (mentioning the girl on tv)

well, i umm, i mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but i have this friend. this actor friend and he would kill me if he thought i was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on thursday?
well, the heart wants what it wants. I will see you later. (he runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
(entering, sees rachel’s throw) ni-hi-ice!
(to joey) so, you busy thursday?
okay. okay. (joey puts him down.) what are you going to do to me if you get the part?
really?
no! no! no! i was so careful! (runs out.)
hey!
so?!
it is thursday! how was the audition?!
let us. (everyone gets up and leaves rachel.)
hey! did you have the baby yet?
he is not snoozing, he is teaching a class.
i have not seen this dress.
you really want to take me?
so you are never actually going to pay me back?
i always knew you were going to make it. I am so proud of you.
(in a manly voice) yeah well, I am going to go spit. (he goes into the bedroom. on his way out, joey gives rachel a wide berth.)
this is so exciting! it is so glamorous! people taking our picture. how do i look?
what?
it is just so glamorous.
good job joe! well done! top notch!
oh-ho-ho, yeah!
the whole thing! can we go?
i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic.
do not go! I am sorry. I am so sorry! (sees another guy who is still asleep.) look! this guy fell asleep! he fell asleep too! be mad at him! (looks at him more closely.) or, call an ambulance.
where have you been?! i tried to call you! i want to talk to you! i still feel so bad!
I am so sorry.
what?!
you do not owe me anything, i do not want you money…
i do not know, five hundred dollars?
well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
do you want a calculator?
here! (hands him one. joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…
uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. which after twenty hours of lessons still came out jamaican.
yes, money well spent!
okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…
ehh, you are just liquored up.
I have had a very long, hard day.
ahh, no thanks. no chicken, bye-bye then.
for the last time no! get out! get out, joey!
are you okay? I am so sorry, he would not leave. he kept asking me about chicken.
hey joe!
yeah, can i get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a coke-(yelps in
hey, pheebs!
uh, the wheatsheaf.
ooh! ahh, pheebs, was going to tell a story.
i can not believe she can out run you man!
oh, ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, them-i-ly.
oh that is not true.
okay, i got to go to work.
and uh, rachel, glad to have you back.
pheebs! (he goes over and kisses phoebe, who is also stunned.) always a pleasure. (and he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
all right, y'know what, we have been talking about london too much have not we?
i got caught up and work, but I am quitting tomorrow.
so, thanks for having me over! rach. (goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) pheebs. (after a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)
well, I am going to go home and bask in the triumph of my central park idea. (gets up to leave.)
i was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
hey, pheebs!
okay, pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… y'know, it did not have any… it-it, well it blew. so, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, atlantic city!
atlantic city!
pheebs! we have to take you to the hospital now!
i know, it is beautiful. amazing.
y'know what else i can not believe? i had to kiss phoebe and rachel every time i left a room, i mean it is too bad they did not see us having sex.
no.
okay. (they kiss again.)
i like her.
well, that is pretty much all I am looking for from these people.
(to ross) all right listen, i have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I would like know whether that is several big fish or just one big fish.
no. this is just part of a dare devil game that i play called ‘wait until the last moment before i burst and die.’
jeez, man did you fall..(sees it is a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) hi! so ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
(to gunther) y'know what gunther, go ah, go ahead, I am-I am talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) this is the part where you say your name.
ginger. I am talking to ginger, so....
nope, nope, I would just ah, I would rather talk to you. (pause) yes, i do. yes, i do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
well, that is the best kiss I have had with anyone I have ever met in a men’s room.
(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
yeah, we are going to have to get you out of those shoes.
no, really you are going to freeze.
you are not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
hey.
oh, i hate that. i once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
great. it was great. she is ah, she is great, great looking, great personality, she is greatness.
joey told you about the leg, huh?
oh god, it freaked me out. okay, i know it should not have, but it did. i mean i like her, i do not want to stop seeing her, but every so often it is like ‘hey, y'know what, where is your leg?’ i mean I am the smallest person in the world are not i? I am the smallest person in the world.
(to monica) actually he is the smallest person in the world.
it came up.
no. no. actually i forgot, what is the deal with that again?
no. no. i do not think so.
that is-that is my nubbin.
it is kind of a ah, a third nipple kind of thing.
well, y'know two regulars. and ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) ahh, what?
you ah, you have, you have to leave, now? how come?
(entering, happily) well hello!
the doctor.
oh yes! just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. yep! two nipples, no waiting.
that was an obvious joke, and i did not think of it. why did not i think of it? the source of all my powers. oh dear god, what have i done!
(enters singing) oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, stop it! why could not they have sent me to texas? 7 of clock maybe I will hit the gym (sits down) who am i kidding pay-per-view porn.
do not disturb do not disturb! monica: (smiles)
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. (she hugs him, and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the tv and sees sharks swimming around thinking chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
ok honey. that was close.
hi honey I am home!
oh it was great.
well, well, well it must be five in tulsa because it is six of clock in ny.c!
(chandler looking confused) honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
no I am not quite sure you got the right movie that is all.
does what always have to be sharks.
what is going on?
let me be a part of this!
no they do not
oh my god! when you came in i switched the channel, i was just watching regular porn
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american action.
you are an amazing wife. (monica shrugs) no really you are amazing you were actually going to do this for me, i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
I am sorry!
rachel, wait, wait.
can i just say one thing?
that is a relatively open weave and i can still see your... nipular areas.
oh, yes, could i have one of those. (points)
okay.
no, she is still upset because i saw her boobies.
it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
y'know, i do not know why you are so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
okaaay, (gestures) rock, hard place, me.
whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what did you mean by that?
huh.
uhhuh, how did you know that?
(without looking up) what? (looks up) what?
y'know, i do not see that happening?
well I am not showing you my 'tat.'
(sarcastic) oh, good. rog is here.
oh, it is nothing, it is a little thing... i hate that guy.
oh look, it is the woman we ordered.
uh, joey's having an embolism, but I would go for a nip, y'know?
joey, if i go first, i want to be looking for my keys.
so, who is up for a big game of kerplunk?
c'mon, I will show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it is not followed by "no thanks, it is late."
hey, kicky. what are you doing?
well, you are going to.
are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
hey, you are not him. you are you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
no. you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. now that was not easy, but you did it! and I would like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "no thanks, I am married."
yeah. i really do.
get off!
(comes out of his room) what? what?
sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
basically we just feel that he is...
things sure have changed here on waltons mountain.
if i turn into my parents, I will either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I will end up like my mom.
you!
well the vet seems to think that is she is becoming a rooster. (the rooster crows.) we are getting a second opinion.
oh, i can uh, check that for ya.
i can check that for ya.
well… we-we do. you can only eat tic tacks in even numbers.
(to rachel) and you… ross, i believe, if you check rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
(to ross) stop that now!
yes!
diet soda.
orange juice.
oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (whispers something in joey’s ear.)
i got it! scotch… tape. (they are right.)
well, we used there is up last night making scary faces.
all right! ten buck! fork it over! cough it up! pay the piper! give me it.
fears and pet peeves.
his legs flail about as if independent of his body!
she has a real name.
althea?! what are you doing?!
you are shooting with althea?!
nice shooting!
actually, it is miss chinandolor bong.
unfortunately that is correct.
i majored in lightning rounds. all right, we are going to destroy you.
well, I am so confused as to what we have been doing so far…
say 200?
(interrupting) all right, hold on! if you win, we give up the birds.
but if we win, we get your apartment.
okay. (starts jumping around.)
dangerous liaisons.
oh! (whispers something in joey’s ear and then in ross’s ear.)
fancy.
fancy guest.
thanks man.
you can not just call monica’s room.
oh, i would never bet this apartment. it is too nice.
hey!
yeah, but i bet it works.
well believe it baby!
i knew it!
cool, girl roommate.
would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!
what?! what-what is it?!
i can not believe we live here!
ohh, she is pretty. pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she is pretty.
i could die.
i tell people secrets. it makes them like me.
hey! (phoebe sneezes)
all right, I am going to do it! I am going to get shot down. any advice?
(gets up) (softly) wish me luck.
wish it! (to the woman, kathy, he likes) hi. hi, i-i was just sitting over there, and uhh, chandler. my name is chandler. did i say that?
uh kathy, with k or a c?
oh-oh-hey!
hey, come on, give me a break, I am out on a limb here.
hey! hey, hey-hey, hey. (joey kisses kathy.)
yes-yes, i was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how i could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
(sees kathy is up watching tv) hi!
jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, i did not expect to have to fight over the remote.
oh my god! that is why i got up too!
hey, listen, I am sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if i would have known you guys were... i never would have...
so ah, joey tells me you two met in acting class.
that is a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
is it on?
hey! (runs over and gets his wonder broom)
oh! it is on! it is on!
there we go little fella.
well the duck can swim.
oh yeah, me too, she is so cool and pretty.
she is smart and funny, y'know? we were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
no, i do not.
thank you, ross.
all right.
all right.
kathy! kathy! hi!! kathy! kathy! (she does not hear him and keeps running, chandler starts chasing her as the theme to the mod squad starts to play. first, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) kathy! (he keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) fetch! fetch it! (he frees himself and resumes the chase) kathy! kathy! kathy! (he now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. he gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) kathy! (he jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) kathy.
oh, i just wanted to say, "hey!"
okay. (he walks away disgusted with himself.)
(entering) okay. you were right. I am in love with joey's girlfriend.
i do not know. i can not--i just, i can not get her out of my head. y'know? i mean, I am a very bad person. I am a very, very bad person. I am a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he does not get one) no you are not chandler! we still love you chandler!
really?!
(laughs) right in there!
99...100! ready or not, here i come! (he opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) all right, let us go over the concept one more time.
hey!
ohh, umm, y'know what, i already ate.
y'know i had a big meal on monday, y'know. so that is just going to get me straight through the week.
you-you do?
you got me.
yeah. right.
okay.
ohh, she is-she is not really my type.
y'know what i think it is? it is the fishnet stockings. y'know? whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
uhh, no-no thanks.
listen, i-I am going to grab a beer. (leaves)
what?
hey, look, what do you want from me?
i am pretending.
okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her? (joey gives him a thumbs up) no-no it will be good, i can tell her much I have been thinking about her. that i have not stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her. that I am so fantastically, over-the-top, want to-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can not believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
can i sleep on your couch?
nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. pffft. pffffffft. (walks over to where joey is seated)
oh, yeah, right, ok... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
(sigh)... and where is this money coming from? (gives money to joey)
(in a deep voice) men are here.
then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
crazy bitch.
hey!
uh, let us see... alvin... simon... theodore.... no.
forget about her.
course there, they just call it food.
I am still on my first. i just think you are nice.
(sarcastic) ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at joey's stupidity)
(pointing out a gift) ok, this one right here is from me.
yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he will die.
oh, that is ross's.
well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his travel scrabble game)
come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
(panicked) ahem... um... crystal duck.
(stuttering incoherently) f-hah.... flennin....
(rubbing his temples) oh, no-no-no-no-no....
no it is not. it is small. it is tiny. it is petite. it is wee.
ok, is there a mute button on this woman?
(quickly) h-he is in china!
what about the time difference?
yes! (rachel walks towards door) you are never going to make it!
well then maybe you should not go.
rachel, i love you! deal with me first! (she leaves)
hey, big...
(quietly) ...spender.
so how did it go?
the fact that you would even ask that question shows how little you know me.
yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
i did not know you had another level.
alright, you did it! do we have any fruit?
really? so, you are going to stick with this 'it is all for her' thing?
do you think that there is a town in missouri or some place called sample? and ah, as you are driving into town there is-there is like a sign, and it says “you are in sample.” (he says it like urine sample.)
yeah, it is two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “they are are no rules.”
yes, but there is two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
oh it is bing, sir. I am sorry , i was just ah...
all right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
thank you! today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
well, i did not do anything. i did not want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
yeah, i know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘them.
(to ross and monica) what if joey were president?
(to his co-workers) what is with him?
well, that is not true, he-he smacked you once.
no sir.
(joining them) hey! which one’s my turkey burger?
nine times! okay, i had to put on lotion! but, it is going to be okay, because as of tomorrow I am conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
excuse me, doug? (no reaction) hey there sports fan!!
no, i ah, i did not do them.
no, no i just ah, did not do them. instead, i ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly do not deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
doug!!
I am a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
no, no. it-it is not about the swearing, it is more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
oh, and do not get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. it is just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it is making all the other guys jealous.
okay. (he starts to leave)
ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
thank you, sir.
no. no, not at all, that is-that is ridiculous.
ye-ye-yeah, yes i do!
run! run you crazy, rich freak!
oh my god! oh my god!
well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. how dumb are you?
he is right. nobody’s going to benefit, and you are just going to hurt her.
all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. and that is what deathbeds are for.
okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issac’s sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebe’s friends with rachel. and that is the trail, i did it!
off?!!
yeah, well i do not think you can make that statement, unless you have been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely.
oh, that is mature.
nothing, nothing.
yeah, well, i guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
(to joey) he has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
uh-oh.
she was not good. not good.
uh-oh.
yeah, never cheat on rachel.
y'know what, i think we can go out there. i mean they have more important things to worry about.
(handing monica the wax) wax the door shut, we are never leaving, ever.
oh great, food with hair on it.
because that would be crazy?
yeah, come on, it is ross and rachel, they have got too.
what?
are you actually saying these words?
let us go.
(to joey) is that your new walk?
are you, are you high?
really? i do not like baths.
honey, it is not the bath i enjoy, it is the wet, naked lady.
really? what do you do? you just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
honey, it is 2:00 on a wednesday and I am watching road rules, how stressed do you think i am?
oh! uh, yeah! is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
oh my god, what is up?!
oh no-no, no you do not, just come back.
do you?
in london?
yes. when monica and i were in london, we were both in london.
if that.
hey.
sex on the balcony?
what is it?
honey, i do not like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
well, this does butch it up a bit.
all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
(thinking) all right, this is not so bad. i like the flower smell! which is okay, because I have got my boat.
oh my god.
I am going to need a bigger boat.
I am in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think there is something wrong.
I am in the bathtub.
i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the water’s tepid. the salt did not dissolve and is now… lodged places. and the scents i used do not compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomile—oh!
the bath salts! they are starting to effervesce! it is different. (pause) it is interesting.
yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh-oh-oh!
i had the exact same conversation.
i do not know! joey has not had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth!
all right, let us break this down. what exactly did he say to you?
uh-huh.
he did not say anything about that to me.
he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
but what did he mean by rules?
because he was looking at her differently.
my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london!
you do not say anything.
I am not going to let you say anything.
oh, god!
do i smell essential oils?
okay.
l-leaving my troubles behind?
oh, it is so hard to care when you are this relaxed.
(upset) hey!
(to monica) you told her?!
(sarcastically) because it is a relaxing and enjoyable time!
you like rachel?!
(sarcastically) yes we are all in here and we would love for you to join us!
I will…I will get you later!
yeah. and what you are doing feels so good.
you are not?
oh, sweet lord. new realms of pleasure!
hey
oh, she is at home, putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight.
i tried, but apparantly singing "i will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
yes, bravo on the hot nanny.
are you kidding? if i was not married she would be rejecting me right now.
now that rachel's gone?
i was not staring. i was leering.
looks like joey is doing allright with her.
seriously dude, 3 years ago.
you do not trust him?
is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? because i could get a job any day now.
allright, fine, but do not blame me if it does not work. because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he is going to have sex with it.
picturing that tree?
where you going, joe?
oh. you mind if i join you?
your thoughts? plural?
I am afraid i can not let you do that, joe.
yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can not let you go.
great novels?
(in a helium voice, holding a balloon) I am sorry, i got a little occupied.
(still helium voice) right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)
(sings in a helium voice) first i was afraid, i was petrified (very happy)
(normal voice) hi
oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). this is yours?
oh, uh, well, i have not seem it but if i do I will let you know.
thanks!
joey, we would have asked you, we just thought you would not be interested.
so excited about your letter!
so you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
that is where people make number two!!
(reading) i do not... uh... understand.
on every word?
and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
you know what? you do not need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
i doubt that! tell her about us last year.
word!
she is right! if i were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) did i just say if i were a guy..?
oh, i do not think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!
sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
hey joe! how is the second draft of the letter coming?
can we read it? can you print out another copy?
it is ok, it is ok. you know what? (takes out his mobile) I will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
(on the phone) hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) uh-huh... uh-huh... okay... thank you. good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
(still looks confused) they loved it.
they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
that sounds like fun.
i think she looks cute. (rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but i am wrong!
like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
and we are done with the chicken fried rice.
or we can do the actual telephone thing.
(entering) hello children!
hey.
really?
well, i try to y'know, squeeze things. (phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) are you okay?
phoebe, it is me. you can tell me anything.
what is going on?
well, my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say.
the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, i think, i think phoebe was hitting on me.
I am telling you i think phoebe thinks I am foxy.
ow!
oh, y'know i-i can not hear that enough.
no, i did not misunderstand, okay? she was all over me! she touched my bicep for crying out loud!
well it is not flexed right now!
sure, I will do it with ya.
that new mountain bike?
your work makes me sad.
(after they have left) okay, did you see that?! with the inappropriate and the pinching!!
okay, so now do you believe that she is attracted to me?
are you serious?
(a little hurt) okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—she knows!
(entering) joey!
phoebe knows about us!
oh man!
ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
hello phoebe, I have been thinking about you all day. (he is holding the phone so that monica can hear it as well.)
well you know that thing you said before, I would be lying if i said i was not intrigued.
yeah, listen, joey is not going to be here tonight so why do not you come over and I will let you uh, feel my bicep. or maybe more.
oh yeah, they are totally going to back down!
(initially worried, but gets over it) really?
yes.
okay, listen, how far am i going to have to go with her?
how do you know?!
at this?!
phoebe.
come on in.
sure.
me? no. you?
so do i.
I am going to put on some music.
you look good.
well, why do not we move this into the bedroom?
oh, do you not want to?
(swallowing hard) well that would be nice. I will go get the lotion.
listen, this is totally getting out of hand! okay? she wants me to put lotion on her!
look, she is not backing down! she went like this! (he does a little mimic of her dance.)
okay, give me a second! (pause) did you clean up in here?
oh, you are-you are going?
(swallowing hard) it is very, very nice. well, come here. I am very were going to be having all the sex.
not if i kiss you first.
well, i guess there is nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
okay! okay! okay! you win! you win!! i can not have sex with ya!
because I am in love with monica!!
love her! that is right, i…love…her!!! i love her!! (they walk together and hug.) i love you, monica.
and hats off to phoebe. quite a competitor. (pause) and might i say your breasts are still showing.
yes, and we would appreciate it if no one told him yet.
ho! ho! ho!
your pants!
santa pants. (phoebe still does not get it.) santa claus’s pants.
uhh, a t-shirt that says, "i do not belong here."
yeah we do!
are you serious?
forget it! okay, I am not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
no. but uh, joey has, and i usually talk to them in the morning time.
(ignoring him) yes, gunther, can i get two cups of chino, please?
forget it! okay, I am not giving up the apartment.
oh my god!
you do know that wham broke up?
where is emily?
man, did not she like just get here?
easy tiger.
so what are you going to do?
are you serious?
because you have only known her for six weeks! okay, I have got a carton of milk in my fridge I have had a longer relationship with!
and i love the milk! but, I am not going to some british girl to move in with me! (realizes that made no sense.) joey, you say things now.
okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
no thank you.
look, i want those basketball seats as much as you do! okay, but we can not leave in the small apartment after we have lived here! did not you ever read flowers for algernon?
look, the only way i will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
screw the knicks!
i did not mean that. i just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
and the knicks rule all.
no. no. we are not going to do that, y’know why? because its not an even trade.
no!
op, op, I am convinced!
all right, but you can not use that again for a whole year. I am in.
okay!
fine, let us do it.
okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
that is a low one!
why are you screaming and hugging?
yeah baby!
tickets please! (rachel hands over the tickets) that is courtside baby!
no they did not!
those were like the best seats ever.
oh yeah, that is very nice. plus, y’know they were free and they are too small.
oh. oh, god! (he starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)
i know!!!
open up! open up! open up!
what the hell is going on?!
we are switching back, right now!
well, you are going to have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we are switching it back! there is nothing you can do to stop us! right, joe?
what?
i do not care, this is our apartment! and they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! and i am getting it back right now. I am getting back right now!
oh no-no-no, no more offers. you can not offer anything to us!
totally worth it!
good night.
okay!
oh, well, that is great!
 no way!
yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay.
ok, i think she is trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs.
well, listen, do not tell us what is going to happen though, because i like to be surprised.
hey, rach, can i get...
not yet.
so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
god?
well, maybe it was god, doing me.
well, you owe me one, big guy.
he said...he said, he said that they are having a great time. I am sorry. but, the silver lining, if you want to see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  without any outside help whatsoever.
you have to really want to see it.
(entering) hi. anybody know a good tailor?
no, no, I am just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
okay.  you have to stop the q-tip when there is resistance!
ok, i do not care what you guys say, something is bothering her.
what stupid thing did you do?
people do stupid things when they are upset.
well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I have got pants that need to be altered.
are you sure he is going to be able to crack that code?
at least as long as i have the pants.
(entering, angry) yo, paisan! can i talk to you for a sec? (pause) your tailor is a very bad man!
joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
cupping.
come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it is crazy, but it is true.
that is ok.
so, you and rachel tonight, huh?
wow! so tonight may be the night! you are nervous?
what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
how can you be so confident?
really? like you have a routine?
really?
you mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
oh, i see what you mean, that is quite nice. (they look at each other, both embarassed)
...and beer!!
hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop staring at your sister's legs!
she went on one of those spray-on tan places.
(to monica) why...why?
sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
hey pheebs!
who is amanda?
are you trying to do a british accent?
just so i know, how many more of those can i expect?
no, had it done to me though. feels good !
hello? is someone on the line?
hang on, she is right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to monica) someone is on the phone, for ya.
(to amanda) i get pedicures!
hold on! there is something different.
was that place... the sun?
oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory all by yourself!
how was your date with joey?
you did not like that?
(without taking his eyes off the bra) you do not know! (monica just smiles)
if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!
well, are not you a treat.
that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey!
kind of... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i can not believe we have not been doing this the whole time.
i can tell from your expressions that that is the good news you were hoping for... well, I am going to go continue to... spread the joy.(chandler leaves the apartment. joey sighs)
dude, it is chandler. let me in.
i know, i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. you have to let me in.
no, i just had to get a picture of this.
i see you later!
oh! (puts his hand on her belly.) she is growing inside you.
oh! (pulls his hand away.)
i think that is the youngest girl ever to reject me.
oh hey!
no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i do not think they exist.
why?
what?
come on, do not be crazy. (to rachel) you do not think there is someone out there better suited for monica than me, do ya? (rachel looks at him.)
a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
luckily, the guy she settled for can not hear what you are talking about.
you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you are still going to date him?
(mouths to phoebe) what?
what is wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (everyone stares at him.) on a barbecue chicken pizza? (still there is staring.) no?
what are you doing?!
i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
cheese you say? that is some pretty smelly work, huh don?
cheese, it is smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too.
is it made of cheese?
(disgusted) oh come on! (to phoebe) are you listening to this?
what do we do?
sure, why do not you set it up. I will just be over here, browsing through the personals.
yeah, fine. fine. not perfect!! but good enough.
I am sorry, did you say cheese?
phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates, and i do not believe in that kind of stuff. but then you two totally get along. so look, i will not stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese.
no. but I am sure (mimics don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
you do not?
so you…you do not want to live with don in a cheese house?
i love you.
y’know what? i am going to take you out to dinner tonight. i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (monica does not look impressed.) no? really? they taste so good.
relax! we will just get her some antacids.
oh my god!
next time, can i say breathe?
where are you going?
you can not leave me alone with her.
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with!
it is just that we have never spent any time, you know, alone together.
okay.
so, ah... any plans for the summer?
hah. may not want to mention this. so, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
well, it is just interesting. you know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who knows? maybe there is something even more painful than those things? like this.
is it really that bad?
I am okay.
alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
wow!
(emotional) it is a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some other stuff I am going to pretend i do not see.
well, that is spongy.
i know. he has your eyes.
i mean, i know that is not possible, but he does.
okay.
how do you feel?
oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know!
well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good.
interesting! (to monica) can i see you for a second?
what do we do?
(panicking) twins! twins!!
uh-huh! join me, will not you?! okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they will find each other and be reunited. i mean, that is a great day for everybody.
what if they are not? what if it is adopted by a king?
monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
(smiles) okay. shhh...
okay.
okay!
(shocked) she? it is a girl?
(to monica) well, now we have one of each! (to the doctor) and that is enough!
maybe. unless they are like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they are pushed through a vagina and they meet.
bye!
have fun at church-camp!
i know! you ready to trade?
okay.
we could trade later.
hey.
her name is erica.
yeah. it is a shame you two did not get to spend more time together.
i love you.
i have no idea what is going on, but i am excited!
we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
really? you got us a chick and a duck?
oh, do not worry, we will find them.
alright.
it is okay, it is just an egg roll.
okay, let us find these birds.
well, that can not be good!
how?
oh, tons, I am quite the woodsman.
joey, wait! the ball!
i do not know. maybe we can open this up somehow.
no... it is all glued together.
i do not know. maybe.
i know! it is.. it is the foosball table.
did that movie ever get made?
and we are also going to buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
what is the matter?
i understand.
i do not know. except that, for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
well, i can not do it either.
we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
that was... impressive.
sorry about the table, man.
you going to buy a new one?
well, at least we got these little guys out.
aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.
yeah, i mean we have got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they would have their own room.
you know, i - i think you are set with the poultry.
i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
wow, this is weird.
where is ross?
(to his children) look around, you guys. this was your first home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
oh, okay.
oh, it is going to be okay.
sure. where?
(looking up with her) that is a plane!
(with a quivering voice) no, I am not!
because it is flattering! (shivers harder) come on monica! come on monica! (he goes inside.)
(whispering) monica!
i know, just quick-quick question, quick question. which one was deep impact and which one was armageddon?
sorry, i just…can not sleep. ooh! (turns on the light and monica groans.) where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? because every time i look at that cover I am like…(fake snores.)
what?! (monica kicks him in the shin.) ow! (he gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
shhhhhhhhh!!! (monica enters) I am sorry, i thought maybe I would make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
it got interesting! damn you oprah!
hey, y’know what we can do? y’know, now that we are up? we can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. it would be fun!
okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
(pause) no. no, i-i was, i was talking about the book i was reading.
that is correct.
(startled) what? what? what?
yeah! you?
(intrigued) yeah? (monica nods yes.) i hope you are not thinking about cleaning the living room.
do you know what just happened?
no. we were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
(turning the light back on) monica?
i was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. so please wake up so we can do it right!
okay.
yeah! (monica falls asleep) no! no! no! do not fall asleep! okay, i am going to make you some coffee. (monica does not move as he gets out of bed and as he is heading for the door.) and i probably will not spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
hm-hmm, i told you! (looks at the clock) i can not believe that I have only got two hours before i call in sick for work.
well, you are not going to believe this, but if you have seven minutes…
do you want to?
dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
yes please.
he is a he?
...could not enjoy a cup of noodles after that. i mean, is that ridiculous? can you believe she actually thought that?
you did?
huh. did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
you are kidding! did you tell her i was not?
well, this is fascinating. so, uh, what is it about me?
ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
what is it?!
oh, oh, a quality, good, because i was worried you guys were going to be vague about this.
i just have to know, okay. is it my hair?
hey, gorgeous.
no, nono, do not- do not worry about it. believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
so, uh... what do you think it is about me?
...quality, right, great.
lowell? financial services' lowell, that is who you saw me with?
well, yeah... 's'no brian in payroll.
no! uh, i d'know! the point is, if you were going to set me up with someone, I would like to think you would set me up with someone like him.
excuse me? you do not think i could get a brian? because i could get a brian. believe you me. ...I am really not.
well, do not we look nice all dressed up?...it is stuff like that, is not it?
nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent mussberger.
you are watching a football game at a funeral?
you are a frightening, frightening man.
oh, no-
hi, I am chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is.
hey.
who are those people?
hey, lowell.
so how is it going there in financial services?
good, good. listen, heh, i dunno what shelley told you about me, but, uh... I am not.
really.
so- you can tell?
so you do not think i have a, a quality?
he is?
out of my league. i could get a brian. (brian enters behind him) if i wanted to get a brian, i could get a brian. (sees him) hey, brian.
that is sweet, joey.
are you aware that you are still talking?
no-no-no! i am the king of bad thanksgivings. you can not just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
it is a tradition, like the parade. if the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
really? worse than, "more turkey mr. chandler?"
it is exactly like it sounds.
arghhhhhh!! (joey turns around to taunt him, but chandler is in the doorway and joey is facing the kitchen.)
I am over here big guy.
(laughing) you did look like an idiot.
oh, come on monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what thanksgiving is all about. y'know, for me anyway. and of course, the indians.
(seeing her) okay.
well, as long as the pilgrims did not eat it, I am in.
oh yeah, it was great. you should be a chef.
emotional knapsack?
right on! oh! uh, but, do not take to long okay? because uh, we are going to test out our fake id's tonight, right clifford alverez.
dude, do not do that too me!
no, it is not that, i just do not want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
i called you fat?! i do not even remember that!
i am so sorry. i really am. i was an idiot back then. i rushed the stage at a wham concert for crying out loud!
i am really sorry. that is so terrible. i am so, so sorry.
we want to hear monica's thanksgiving story!
yeah, we were just talking about that. i can not believe how stupid we used to look. (they both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
oh my god!
you just, you look so different! terrific! that dress! that body!
sorry!
sorry.
monica, i was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
okay.
are you all right?
what?
without my toe?! i need my toe!
that is why i lost my toe?! because i called you fat?!
that is why for an entire year people called me sir limps-a-lot?!
yeah, well, i miss the tip! it is the best part. it has the nail. (he storms out.)
i can not believe this.
yeah, well, sorry does not bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! i hate this stupid day! and everything about it! I will see you later.
yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (he goes into his apartment.)
oh-oh, I am a duck! i go, "quack, quack!" I am happy all the time!
nice try.
look, monica…
this is not going to work.
you are so great! i love you!
nothing! i said, i said "you are so great" and then i just, i just stopped talking!
no i did not!
no i did not!
no i do not! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it is like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out.
the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we are in the car, we are fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
oh, i think this is the episode of three's company where there is some kind of misunderstanding.
oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i did not need it, so i balled it up and... (sees that monica is glaring at him) ...now i wish i was dead.
yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
(looking out the window) ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster!
you do not get a lot of 'doy' these days...
...dinah?
now, monica, you know that is not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
boys? we are going in.
kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon?
i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
what does she do?
well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
i dunno, but.. i think it is about to attack the enterprise.
y'know, i can not believe I am getting my nails done!  and you said it was going to be fun! (pause) which it kind of is.  also, you said there would be other guys here. there are no other guys here!
that is a mailman! that is our mailman! (waves to the mailman) (sarcastic) hi. how are ya?
hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
(entering, with janice in tow) hello!
is not this amazing?
okay. bye.
bye.
bye.
b-bye!
bye. (finally closes the door on her.) (after it is closed) i can not stand the woman! (phoebe is shocked, joey is relieved.)
yeah, i know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? like her voice, her laugh, her personality—well, they are all back! y’know? and she is picked up like nine new ones!
do not worry about it. I am taking care of it tonight. (chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
(standing in the door of the fridge) well, i do not have to break up with her this time. we are not involved! I am going to do a pre-emptive strike! I am going to end it with her before it starts. my ass is like frozen! (closes the fridge.)
yes, i-i know that you do, but i think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing old man river.
(laughs) okay, we have to talk. I am just getting out of a very serious relationship…
right! i just think that this is happening too soon.
i hear ya. (pause) but! unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
no! no! not, paris.
okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (thinks) yemen. that is right, yes, I am being transferred to yemen!
i do not know exactly.
but i do know that it is some time tomorrow.
y’know uh, you did not really have to help me pack.
well, i-i thought i did but, i-i guess i did not!
oh, I am packing. y’know I am-I am packing ‘because I am moving to yemen tomorrow.
I am only going to pretend I am moving to yemen, it is the only way i can get rid off her.
(to janice) okay. (to joey) joey, trade lives with me!
(from his bedroom) thanks!
y’know you, really did not have to take me to the airport.
well, we are really not that close. (pause) okay, so i guess this is uh, good-bye then.
okay. then i guess it is just, wait here then. (hands her the sign that says, wait here.") (to the ticket agent) hi. i need one fake ticket to yemen.
oh no-no-no, no. no, no, no, i just, i just need a pretend ticket.
what would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
no. all right, y’know what, she is (points to janice) going to think that I am handing you a credit card, but what I am really going to do is hand you a library card.
(to the ticket agent) american express?
well, i-i guess i got to go.
well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
okay, good-bye. good-bye.
no!
janice! there you are! there you are! i had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after i got on the plane!
well, i then guess I am going to yemen! I am going to yemen! (to this old woman also going to yemen.) when we get to yemen, can i stay with you?
if only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (joey nods his agreement.)
is that gal pal spelled l-of-s-e-r?
no, we are just four people with neck problems. you talk like this. (out of the sides of their mouths.)
nice work my friend.
and a bagel with only…
(entering) hey!
well, i see you have had a very productive day. do not you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
all right! (he joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) is not this a woman's hat?
y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
all right, ready?
two.
yeah, that is kind of a relief.
you want to see if we still have it?
free porn!!!
we have free porn here!!!
what is wrong with you?
this sounds like a hernia. you have to—you-you—go to the doctor!
that is still in there?!
stick to your side!
mento?
thanks.
well this one's for you.
no, i can not. no-no, listen, i, i know how much this means to you and i also know that this is about more than just jewelry, (puts bracelet on joey) it is about you and me and the fact that we are (reading bracelet) best buds.
that is what they will call us.
it hurts me. it physically hurts me.
you are turning into a woman.
now I have upset you? what did i say?
oh my god, introduce us!
(to bonnie) so ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
tell it again. (pause, we see rachel is not amused.) seriously.
(reading the back of the picture) me and frank and phoebe, graduation 1965.
you are not going to die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I will be your boyfriend.
why is that so funny?
ha-ha-ha. a little to hard. what am i not ah, boyfriend material?
okay, so we have established my name, and hit me. but theoretically y'know, i mean say we were not friends, say it is a blind date. i show up at your door, and I am like (in a fake voice) “hey, nice to meet, ya. hey, oh-hey.”
hey!
what a minute, i know that hat! i was taken aboard that hat! they did experiments on me! i can not have children!!
buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
big bullies!!
hey!
bored and bored!
yes!
okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
so, you still do not think I am boyfriend material?
i saw you checking me out during the game last night.
yeah, well, lucky for you.
i do not know.
oh, yeah, i do not know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
where ya going?
(to joey) noo!! i do not care! I am not, I am not going to playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
okay, then you got to back away, all right? you do not need that kind’ve hurt. take it from a guy who is never had a long term relationship......
ahhhh! (steps away from her.)
oh, ahh, no thanks, i just had an m&m.
there is not one hair on that head.
(in a fake voice) hi there.
okay! okay! let me try it again, you are going to want to date this next guy, i swear!
hi! I am dorf! you are date for the evening. (monica walks away in disgust) oh come on! dorf on dating, that is good stuff!!
hey!
I will give up my ticket.
and i think ross is generous too.
hey!
ross.
(on machine) you have reached monica and chandler’s, if you are listening to this message, we are probably screening. (to himself) yeah we are.
(on phone) this is chandler bing! this is chandler bing! (listens) yes, the groom—no! not the groom!!
(gets up) see you later. (starts to leave.)
(angrily) well next time ask! or at least wait for me to ask! (he storms out.)
(on machine) this is chandler bing! this is chandler bing! (the machine beeps off.)
I am not freaking out. why would i be freaking out? a woman named heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (does one of those chandler noises.)
right here! (clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
phoebe and rachel! so the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, phoebe and rachel, heldi, and apparently some band called starlight magic 7 who are available by the way!
okay.
yes, if it really does not mean anything, because you know that I am just not ready…
okay. (they hug.)
totally.
yeah, it is beautiful.
i know.
this coming from the man who could not split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
hey, what are you doing here? should not you be at work?
I am so sorry you are sick.
I am going to grab you some tissue.
yes?
oh my god, introduce us!
boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (rachel glares at him.)
i know, let us rest and drink lots of fluids. (holds up a glass of orange juice.)
that would be impossible to resist if you were not all drippy here. (points to his nose.)
yeah, i do not you should say that even when you are healthy.
do not take this personally okay? it is just that i just can not have sex with a sick person.
that is the thing, see i would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
oh what is it honey, you need some tea? some soup? (he gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. or at least she is trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) oh-ohhhh!
oh jeez honey, i thought, i thought you were asleep.
i was asleep. (she takes off her robe and starts to shiver) oh no! no-no honey! y’know what is sexy? layers. layers are sexy. and blankets are sexy. and oh! hot water bottles are sexy.
would you please get some rest!
really? struck down in the pribe of libe!
no-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
no-no-no-no-no!
okay.
so you are just, kind of rubbing it on yourself?
it is nice.
yes! (hangs his head in shame.)
it is all very, very good. (she covers up and sits down.) so you want to go uh, mix it up?
oh come on you big faker!
well that was before all the vaporizing action.
okay! (runs into the bedroom.)
(calling from the bathroom) what are you doing here?
we got some vap-of-rub in some places.
he is taking off her coat!
ho-oh, he is going to get some! (rachel looks at him.) of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. y’know so umm, he is closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (pause) well, I am off to bed! (goes to bed.)
yeah.
twenty percent is a pretty generous tip joe.
i see where you are going!
(reminiscing) ah, finally an explanation.
hey-hey, is monica here?
okay, look i need your help, i do not know what to get her for valentine’s day.
(laughs) she was working on valentine’s day so we are celebrating it tonight.
well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to ross flashing joey a very evil look; joey gets scared) i can not do that we promised we would make each other gifts this year.
yeah, i thought so to until i paper mached one of my eyes shut.
i made a… (does one of those gibberish words.)
nothing!
well, have you guys made anything that maybe i can take credit for?
(admiring his work) this, this actually is a… (does the same gibberish word from before.)
hey! honey, can i ask you a question about the valentine’s day gifts?
do we have to make the entire thing?
of course, of course not. i just have to uh, go over to the place where i-i made it and pick-pick it up.
(sticking his head back in) what?
hey.
what?!
okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
i can not figure out what to make monica.
I am going crazy! okay? do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
yeah, i guess i could use that. i could say that your love sends me to the moon.
wait a minute, i can not give this to her.
because it says "captain ross" on the side and "i hate monica" on the bottom.
okay. okay. (he goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. he takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. then he holds it out as if he is giving it to her.) yes honey, i made it myself. (he throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. he turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) i can not do it. i can not do it. (he throws them both down and continues looking. he opens another closet door and finds a tape.) oh! oh! a mixed tape! a mixed tape!! (he runs out into the living room.)
hey! hi! you uh, ready to exchange gifts?
okay, come here! come here.
now, it is not wrapped because i just, just finished it.
but i made you a tape of what i think are all romantic songs.
(momentarily terrified) maybe we will have to listen and see!
okay!
yeah!
it is a sock bunny.
not really.
i see. y’know umm, phoebe makes sock bunnies.
oh, it is okay. i do not…
(thinking it over) well, i did put a lot of thought in the tape. (they both run into the bedroom.)
wow! (to the sock bunny still on his hand.) you are way to young to have seen that!
you are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
yeah! (takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
you have done enough!
no you do not—get it in black, not brown.
oop!
well, it is like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
who the hell is carl?!
y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, are not they?
oh my good god.
look, you have done enough! okay? you have to stop this now.
oh, the mixed tape.
no! you are the sweetest! (he tries to kiss her but monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
i am so, so, so, so sorry!
and i will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and do anything in there! (points to the bedroom.)
come on monica, it is our valentine’s day. please? please-please, please?
okay. (they hug.)
so, are we going in there?
hey!
oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
yeah, i think that is wrong, but there is a connect the dots in here for you later. (to monica) hey, how about maroon?
oh that is so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they do not serve donuts. (no one laughs.) y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? i think i can come up with something better than that.
hey!
oh, y'know what? the last time joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you could get arrested.
hi, joe.
oh, come on! you have been acting strange all day!
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that? (imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) i kind of have a dream! i do not want to talk about it.
you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing?! oh, that is so cool! (to monica) i can not tell you how many times I have dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (seeing monica's stare.) (to joey) anyway we are talking about your dream. (to monica) i love you. (to joey) your dream? (leans in to listen closely.)
no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you are jealous because I have become the apartment stud.
joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
well there you have it!
well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe-maybe that is it?
oh yeah, it is actually in my bedroom.
(entering) hey!
y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so…
(looking at the sketch) oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
okay.
yeah.
(straining) okay.
okay, i do not think we can turn anymore!
shut up! shut up! shut up!!
okay, yeah, i think it is really stuck now.
oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
(stopping him) hey, whoa-whoa! what is she like?
ooh, i do! i do! i do!
(to rachel) he has a gun!
what?
okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
ross, just for my own piece of mind, you are not married to anymore of us are ya?
you left a shoe here?!
oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I will be sure to give him your shoe.
(not enthused) yeah, all right.
whoa-whoa-whoa! what?
yeah, I am going to pass. ‘because i was kind of iffy when it was puppies.
little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben. (tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. it is times like these I am glad smell-of-vision has not been invented.) do you know what pheebs? when you are done over there, we kind of have a situation over here too. (phoebe is changing hers.)
see that is where i think that you are wrong. we have been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and y’know mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… (he degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)
okay, I am a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.
hey!
shocking! since you still have the keys.
what equity investments?
you do not even have a car!
and?
there you are.
(entering) check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog! (he holds up this xena-like warrior action figure.)
he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!
they are not going to swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
glass, sand, whatever. (walks out as monica and phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
(entering) all right. (clears throat) i thought about it and maybe you are right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y’know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it is lodged in my throat. (mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (he does it again.)
but you found the keys to his clothes?
that is true.
ahh, i think it just moved. it is really poking me.
i think that is gum.
okay, listen this really hurts. let us go.
(entering) hey!
well, let us just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
and protected them from a tornado?
was the setting of phoebe’s triumph.
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
(pause) phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
oh no-no-no, I am, I am paddling away!
wow! really?! we get all this rusty crap for free?!
could we be more white trash?
hey uh, rach, funny story. i ah, bumped into joanna on the street yesterday.
well, no, actually she uh, asked me if i wanted to get a drink.
(laughs) no. no!
well, not at first.
well, i think i judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
oh, come on! it is not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i mean usually I am pretty much just in there by myself.
okay, i promise, I will end it.
i hope you know what I am giving up for ya, because she is not just the boss in your office, if you know what i mean.
…it was like the algonquin kids table. (they all laugh, but joey only laughs not to be left out.)
it just does not…feel like we are breaking up.
okay.
thanks.
okay. (starts to button up his shirt)
I am getting dressed.
when i walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
what is it?
ah-ha, you are not the boss of me. (she kisses him) yeah, you are! (she handcuffs him to the chair) ooh, saucy.
you are, you are going to leave me like this?
okay. but if you do not come back soon, (she leaves and closes the door) there is pretty much nothing i can do about it!
hi! (to sophie) how are you?
hello, joanna…(realises he does not know her last name)…’s office.
how little?!
look, this is not funny! you get back here right now!
why not?!
what?!
(in a serious, businesslike tone) rachel, could i see you for a moment?
okay, here is the situation. the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? and on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
i did break up with her! she just took it really, really well!
it did enter my mind! but then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
no-no-no-no-no-no-no!! i can not get myself right out of them! you must have me confused with the amazing chandler!! come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I am cold, and (stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind joanna’s desk.)
never!
fine!
i—never borrowed your walkman.
you got it! here we go! come on! this is great! (rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) ahhh! (he starts rubbing his wrist)
no, i just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (he runs over to where his pants are hanging) hello sweet pants!
about what?
I will make something up! I am good at lying, i actually did borrow your walkman!
oh-ho-ho, i do not think so!
well, this is much better.
hey, look, you are in trouble either way! okay? if she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she is going to know you were in here. so you might as well just let me go.
it still would not be clean. (rachel makes an ‘eww, disgusting!’ face) all i want is my freedom.
freedom!
freedom! i want my freedom! why will not you here me?! (opens the door) sophie, help me! help me!! (sophie stands up)
I am going to say this for the last time. would you please just… (he moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)
no!
with extra pulp?
no!
you do not have it.
how do monica and phoebe know?
(intrigued) go on.
and milton berle has a…
(hello) hello.
(to rachel) i love you. (kisses her on the forehead)
(checks his watch) two hours, that lasted!
i think so.
could there be more kims?
her what?!!
you had a bachelorette party?!
i thought we were not going to have bachelor/bachelorette parties! y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
you went home with the waitress.
i can not believe you did not tell me! you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
my god! you must be good in bed!
she is okay with rachel and the baby?
well, you have to honest with her! otherwise you may think that you are going down the same path, but you are really going down different ones.
what?
honey! that is crazy! i do not want you to get me a stripper…
look, i appreciate it, but uh, it is a little creepy. y’know? I am not a bachelor anymore.
all right fine! but I am only doing this for you!
and joey.
ah, no-no-no just ross. ross and joey is embarrassing enough.
i understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
what are you doing?
okay. i can not believe tomorrow’s the big day.
you are right, this is more fun.
hi. (joey blows on a noisemaker.)
that is me.
yeah, yeah right over there.
that was weird.
so she is a…
i can not believe there is a naked hooker in there!
could be. i mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (walks towards the bedroom.) madam, are you also a stripper?
that is funny, maybe for my birthday she will murder someone.
oh actually, I would rather you…yeah, go ahead. we are going to have to burn that room down anyway.
why would she do that?
this is the worst bachelor party ever!
(to joey) in a minute? what is going to happen in a minute?!
why me?!
which is why you should do it.
you do it!
all right rock, paper, scissors who has to tell the who are to leave! (joey smirks.) what?
i do not think we have actually done this before!
well we…we still hang out.
well y’know, things are different. I am…I am married now.
yeah, i miss that too. i tell you what; from now on we will make time to hang out with each other.
her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
monica! wait!
(puts on his crown) carry on.
could you not narrate?
hey!
monica and i are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we have got reservations at ja george.
made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and did not get desert.
hey caitlin! somebody got a haircut.
yeah, if that was true, gym class would have been a lot more interesting.
oh, okay. (hands her the money.) here you go.
oh, he is in the back. the duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
okay, bye!
what?
i was not flirting.
okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. and second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. that is all.
you want to see flirting? I will show you flirting. (starts to move towards ross.)
i was not flirting.
i was not and oh god, shh!
is that what this is about? you like caitlin?
so, joey on law & order, you must be very proud!
I am sorry, i thought you were joey's other grandmother. (she just stares at him.) I have done it again.
happy anniversary, 10 months! (they kiss.)
uhh, joey's grandmother is right there. (points)
the one that does not.
hey, why do not you wear those earrings i gave you?
okay.
if you said, "big lima bean, bubbling up." would she understand the difference?
here you go. (hands her the money.) now stop bringing us pizzas you.
you are welcome.
what?
thank you for that! (to monica) i was not flirting.
really?!
(starts to laugh, but then gets serious) so umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than i am.
yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. rachel, when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
(smiling) well, what is it?
(smiling) if we keep talking this way, are not we going to freak her out soon?
does not know, "hello." but she knows capricorn one.
so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order?
see, I am finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area!
oh, I am so glad we cleared that up. look, I am sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
okay, I have already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, "I am just flirting, no big deal." but the guy is thinking, "finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
it is true.
again true.
all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
uh, joey is going to be right back. right back! (tries to pantomime it for her.) meanwhile, let us-let us-let us talk about you. (pause.) so, you are old and small.
okay, hold on. (pauses as he readies himself.) okay. (walks away.)
(to monica) if this is the way all the gellers flirt, we do not have a problem.
oh the humanity.
more so than anything else.
almost over man.
why am i looking?
you could not have at least changed your shirt.
(singing) ground control to major tom! commencing countdown…engines…on!
(to monica) hey!
you ready?
you look amazing. I am the luckiest man in the world.
let me see the earrings.
(looking at them) they look great! does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
(to ross) thanks for picking out the earrings man.
i will have one. (ross and him both take one.)
okay, I am not going to have one.
all right I will have one. (he and ross take another brownie,)
see that is the problem with invisible dentists.
that is so weird, because every time i go to the dentist, i look down the hygienist’s blouse.
hey! hold on a minute, hold on a second. do you think these pearls are nice?
janice’s birthday is coming up, i want to get her something speacial. come in here with me.
that is a good idea, ‘dear janice have a hubba-bubba birthday’. i would like to get her something serious.
all right. look, I am going to go in here, and you do not buy me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)
why not?!
what is the thing?
(shocked) what?
well she, she would not do that, she is with, she is with me.
yeah, well, you are wrong! okay, you are wrong.
ah, i do not know, you tell me. anything you ah, want to tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
you tell me! maybe, it is because i was just fooling with my ex! oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
all right!
joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
no! in his office! how many kisses were there?
wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? there should be no kissing!!
(giving her a bag) here.
I will take it! all right look, i got to know. are you finished with me? (janice shakes her head no) are you finished with him? (janice shakes her head no) do you still love him? (janice shakes her head yes) do you still love me? (janice shakes her head yes) all right look, (grabs the bag) I am going to need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)
yeah.
what?
all right.
i talked to janice.
she does not know. says she loves us both. y'know i woke up this morning and i was in love, well i was happy. y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. and now i can not even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
i do not know, y'know. what, what, would you do?
come on, tell me.
what? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) what are you, what are you talking about?
janice, i have something i need to tell you, and i want you to let me get through it, because it is, it is, it is not going to be easy.
i think you should go back with gary. i do not want to be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. whenever i would see him i was always think y'know ‘you are the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and i hated that guy. and it did not matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my dad.
yeah, well. it is the right thing to do.
then do not leave me!
forget what i said, i was babbling! pick me!
no you do not! no, no, no, i say you have to give your divorce another chance.
ohhh. do not go.
no. no! no! no!
i do not care! (turns around and to the people watching them) i do not care!!
you can not leave! i have your shoe!
(singing) I will hold you close in my arms. (phoebe enters) i can not resist your charms. and love....
(high pitched) no you know i do not mind.
i know.
I have found.
yep! from now on its going to be the four of you guys and me and the misses. the little woman. the wife. the old ball and chain.
the young hot ball and chain.
what is up?
listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I am buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
but you are still my friend?
during this time…are you, are you still my best man?
do i still call you ross?
(smiling) hey, i hear what your saying, okay? and, thanks for the warning.
so are we…friends again?
okay. (pause) you will not believe what monica’s older brother just said to me!
(entering from the bedroom) okay. here is a question you never have to ask. my dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
yes, include more people in this.
wait a minute! i have a date tomorrow night.
well you do not have to sound so surprised.
what?
honestly? me too.
yeah. y’know i keep thinking that something stupid is going to come up and I will go all…chandler. but nothing has.
okay. I will be right there.
we are the bings.
mr. and mrs. bing! (walks away.)
hi.
mom. thanks for wearing something. (they hug.) (she is wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
hi…dad.
oh my god! (he and monica walk away.)
how did you guys find me? i knew i should have hid at the gym!
panicking! and using the internet to try to prove that I am related to monica. how is she?
no! no! no! i can not do that!
because if i go home, we are going to become the bings! i can not be the bings!
the bings have horrible marriages! they yell. they fight. and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
no.
it is not just their marriage! i mean, look at yours. look at everybody’s! the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman! and I have met me; i am not paul newman. i do not race cars! i do not make popcorn! none of my proceeds go to charity.
i want to. i love her so much, but I am afr…it is too huge.
well yeah, but then…
depends on what you mean by we.
no.
yeah okay. well, what is the next little bit?
yeah. you are right. hey i-i can do that.
okay, excuse me for a minute. (starts to leave)
ross, i am not going to run away again! i just want to get a little fresh air.
okay.
oh fresh air!
what?
ross! (he starts to get up.)
(standing up) that is right! I am not!
i know about monica.
yeah, i heard you and rachel talking.
you do not know?
monica’s pregnant.
well i was! then i went down to the gift shop because i was out of cigarettes…
big picture please! so i was in the gift shop, and that is when i uh, saw this. (he holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads i (heart) new york.) yeah, y’know what? i thought anything that can fit into this, can not be scary.
but come on, look at how cute and small this is! so i got it to give monica so she would know i was okay.
you look beautiful mom. (his dad clears his throat.) you look beautiful too dad. i love you both. (he kisses his dad on the cheek) I am so glad you here. (he kisses his mom.)
are you joey?
you look beautiful. is this new? (her dress.)
okay.
(in monica’s ear) he is greek orthodox.
(to ross) no, that is okay. (ross nods and retreats.) monica i thought this was going to be the most difficult thing i ever going to had to do. but when i saw you walking down that aisle i realized how simple it was. i love you. any surprises that come our way it is okay, because i will always love you. you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with. you want to know if I am sure? (he leans in and kisses her.)
i do.
(to monica) i love you. and i know about the baby.
our baby.
phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
then…who did?
what is the matter honey?
(incredulous) already?!
oh, i got some thoughts on that.
what in god’s name is that?!
well, you could not get them anyway. ian does not plan anymore and derrick… (off of rachel and monica’s looks) and derrick is a name i should not know.
why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
okay.
centerpieces!
definitely roses. (monica and rachel exchange a look.) well, i just think they are a little more weddingy. (monica holds the lily picture closer to him.) but lilies are the clear choice.
uh-huh!
oh yeah, i should probably call them.
oh, i do not think i ever heard that story.
what a sweet story.
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
i do not know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. she is saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (pause) dollywood.
honey, it is going to be okay.
look, it really is going to be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that we are going to get married.
well, i have some.
well, close to… (notices rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to monica as phoebe averts her eyes.)
well, you are not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
well, come on, I have been saving this money for six years and i kind of had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
no, i realize that honey, but I am not going to spend all of the money on one party.
look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no.
yes, i am!
hey.
ehh.
look, i thought about it too, and I am sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
yeah, I am putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that is what we are going to do.
eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y’know? we will pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
yeah.
uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
well, stuff like where did we live, y’know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it is collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we would have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.
sure you do.
you sure?
i love you so much.
oh yeah, totally!
i have no idea.
yeah! I am just pretending to watch the game so i do not have to help out with stuff.
nope! every once and a while i just scream stuff at the tv.
yeah! anderson just scored again! (to phoebe) there is no anderson.
oh hey. I would shake your hand but uh; I am really into the game. plus, i think it would be better for my ego if we did not stand right next to each other.
I am watching the game, but I am not deaf!
(to phoebe) y’know, it is been a while since we have screamed something. maybe we should.
oh come on!
good game!
yeah. solid effort. solid effort.
(simultaneously) detroit.
everybody at my school heard it! you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island?!
I am sorry. when you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
did she look 16?
well, she probably was not familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
yes, i believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now.
okay.
(to monica) oh, well thank you in advance. (kisses her.)
hey!!
oh that is right. it is your first day! so are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
are you judging them by their covers? because you are really not supposed to do that.
hey!
wait a minute, hold the phone! you are not elizabeth’s dad?!
ross!
there is a mr. bing!
but uh ross, ross is a great guy! i was roommates with him in college. uh, funny story… (he starts laughing then notices that paul is not happy.) you are roommate in college died did not he?
yes, we were just…
hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were going to to get the kind with the baby.
no, the little girl creeps me out.
why would the baby creep me out?
this is going in your book?
hey!
damn those robots, they are supposed to be our faithful servants!
so do you think uh, joey’s more charming than me?
yeah, you wish. (stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
who?
hmm.
oh.
oh-oh.
we said seven!
the only way that i said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.
oh my good god.
what?!
(disgusted) what does it say?!
thank you for writing your book. its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
(to monica) i told you i should not wear this color. (he is wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
so you knew we were going to miss the movie!
oh I am so sorry man! is there anything i can do?
hi, how are ya?
(whispering in joey’s ear) the reason he just said.
yeah, I have been there my friend.
(not amused) and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open.
i did not nail the boxes to the floor.
yes, and while I am doing that, ross has a great computer story for you.
so, uh, wh-where ya from?
unbelievable
hey, look at all the boxes!
all right, think about it. now remember when you were going out with that girl donna and you guys broke up. remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
now imagine you live at the supermarket.
no-no
ok, I am officially unpacked. thanks for helping me man. (turns around and sees that joey is not there.) joe? (hears giggling coming from a box) well, i guess joey went home. oh and look, there is still one box that i have to unpack. (hears the giggling again)
(pretending) oh my god! you-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
yeah, not bad right? you know what, monica’s going to be working late, so I am going to make this place spotless. you know what else I am going to do, know what else I am going to do? I am going to go downstairs, I am going to get her some flowers. now who would not want to live with me?
yeah, now how is that going though? are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
what does it look like I am doing? i am cleaning!
authorization? i do not need that. I am going to put everything back.
yes I am going to put it back (mocking ross) exactly where i found it.
she is not going to care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
she is going to recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
i see, i see, y-y-you are trying to freak me out.
no, she is not okay? and I will prove it to you. I am going to call her right now. (picks up the phone and wipes it off) phone's done ehh.
hey mon, how is it going?
oh come on, come on, it can not be that bad.
no! no-no-no-no-no-no. it sounds like they really need you down there.
it is, all good! okay bye-bye mon! (to ross) she is-she is going to kill me.
we should start with the big stuff. y’know? that will be the easiest. uh, let us start with the couch. (he picks up one end and ross does not help) i got it. (he moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they will not reach) ok, ok, here is what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
ok well here, we will just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
yes, but the coffee table does not match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!!!
oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?
yeah, monica does not like that either, maybe i should stop doing that.
that is not specific to girls.
and they do not like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
man, I am so lucky i have monica.
okay, is this lamp in the same place?
(blocks the door) no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! you can not come in here! r-r-r-r-ross is naked.
(to ross) i could not say that i was naked because she is allowed too see me naked.
look, uh, just come later, we will get everything squared away and you can come back later.
bye! thank god
look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we got to get everything back into its original place.
that is perfect! that is brilliant! (starts going through the photo album)
uh-huh
no, i do not see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (forced laughter)
okay look, do not...do not be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and I am sorry, I am very sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.
do you want me to be afraid of you?
really?
oh well you are the best. you come here to me.
ba dum bumb cheshhh!
honey, you remember my boss doug right?
i did not know you and carol were getting divorced, I am sorry.
no.
oh yeah. boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture does not it?
oh uh, as it turns out, we can not do it. monica has to work.
oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
it is the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
well now-now you are just talking crazy.
because uh…we-we…we split up. monica and i split up. hold me.
y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. can i choke ya?
oh no-no-no, monica would freak. (doug looks at him.) but to hell with that bitch.
oh that is all right sir, and that is just one girl.
it is a hand. it is a thing you use as a jack and coke holder.
oh no-no-no!
hi honey I am home.
it was awful. to get out of going to dinner with doug i told him that you and i split up. so then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when i would not give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
y’know what the worse part was? i got to see what my life would be like without you. it was like it is a wonderful life with lap dances. please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
ooh, i do not know if we are there yet.
(reading the comics) eh..., i do not, i do not know.
well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
(thinks about it) yeah?
excuse me little one, i have a very solid backhand.
i was shrieking... like a marine.
(reading the paper) says here that a muppet got whacked on seasame street last night. (to ross) where exactly were around ten-ish?
look out kids, he is coming! (ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)
yes. yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it is the only chance to see new york.
ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
how... exactly are you pursuing that? y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
he is right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
because, I am too afraid.
yeah, that would be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
(to joey) does this mean we are going to have to start paying for coffee? (joey shrugs his shoulders.)
i spelled out boobies.
so, how many have you sold so far?
oh my god, how did you do that?
me! on my computer.
eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
something else i might have said?
you-you-you do not want to give into the fear.
run, joey! run for your life! (runs out)
tell us what happened, brown bird ross.
(to rachel, who is entering) hey! how did the interview go?
y'know what rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
well seeing that drunk santa wet himself, really perked up my christmas.
it is like ‘night of the living dead christmas trees.’
sure, everybody loves a kidder.
(to ross) should i tell her i ordered tea?
I am an alien. I am an alien.
so did monica tell you about this great band called the swing kings that we are trying to get to play at the wedding?
oh since forever! i used to go all over town listening to bands!
gap commercial. (to monica) so did you book them? did you call?
do you want me to call?
staying out of the way.
sure! that is one of the great things about being engaged. I am not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
(to ross) smooth.
so ross, how was your date the other night? did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
huh.
hey!
uh joe, when it is one of the clock in the morning and you do not come by? that is okay!
really? right across the street?
when’d you meet her?
excellent! y’know ross met somebody too!
hi! how did it go?
(sarcastically shocked) really?! joe? what would you do if you were in ross’s situation?
so this is nice! i wish i did not have to go, believe me! but unfortunately i have to. (he gets up and joey moves over next to ross.) oh uh, by the way, what is the name the girl you are dating?
bye! (exits.)
joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (he goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
(returning) what are you guys talking about?
but i love swing music!
look all i know is when monica and i went to see them, we had fun! and there is another reason too.
i do not want to say.
well it is just while monica and i were dancing to them it was…the first time i knew that…you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with.
hi, honey! I am home!
why? do you another boyfriend in there or something?
y’know it is funny i started it but, now it is scary me. so could you come out here please?
oh you got a wedding dress? that is great!
well then why can not i see it?
okay i promise. I will-I will hate it. (she enters.) wow! you-you look…hideous.
yeah, that is like the most ugliest dress I have ever seen. wh-why do you to return it?
oh that is great! great! thanks! but that dress i mean it is like yuck! it is terrible! it makes me want to just rip it right off of you!
okay!
(without turning around) i thought you were going to be gone all day.
yeah ross, i mean... we are excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we are going to want to do, you know, "island's stuff".
yeah, that is the same as "it has something to do with wind".
(upset) she does?
i would not read too much into it.
david, let me stop you there because i think i see where this is going. I am not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you want to advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
seriously, we are going to do this?
oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that david is not amused) oh, I am sorry, that is the kind of thing i do. (pause) they broke up because mike did not want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you would be open to marriage?
what?
i did not mean now...
well, you are welcome! glad i could help.
david, I am pretending to read here!!
(smiling cheekily) i do! want a hint? huh? "i do" (monica looks confused, so chandler repeats) "i do".
david is going to propose to phoebe.
be-because, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married.
i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?
man, that is some bad advice!
that is why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!
tonight?! (looks at the ring) is not an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) oh, there it is!
(slaps him on the shoulder) nice! (goes to monica)
monica, can i talk to you for a sec? (pulls her away from phoebe and rachel)
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!
that would be advice!!
oh, is it on the computer, cuz I would love to give it a read...?
(offended) what? (pause) may i?
(at the laptop) oh, no, no, no dear god, no!
your computer, i do not know wha... everything's gone!
it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.
someone i do not know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.
well, it did not say "this is a virus"!!
nude... (ross looks at him)... pictures of anna kournikova. I am so sorry.
it is not gone! i mean, I am sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?
well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
i just feel awful.
well, i tried billy jean king, but... (ross glares at him) you know, you and monica have the same "I am going to kill you" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her... (ross continues to glare at him and chandler leans in as if he is going to kiss ross)
(pretending not to sense the tone) oooh! i hope you are happy too, honey!
phoebe is going to say "yes"? that is, that is great!
and there is not chance that will work?
(pointing at her) oooooooh! meddler! meddler!
this vacation sucks!!
you know, it is very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? (doing david) "uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..." spit it out, david!
i would not brag too much about that thing, big guy.
oh, are not this nice? it is so quiet, i could just lie here all day.
I am so glad we have got adjoining rooms!
hey! remember when i had corneas?
ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) not to mention the cold sores.
(to the one sitting next to him) really?
i do not think so!
because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it is cute, others disagree, and I am lying!
oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?
and...?
I am not playing with you.
she gets crazy! this scar (points to his forehead) is from pictionary!
(nearly whispering) oh dear god, there is two of them!
(to phoebe) did you know this about him?
(interrupting her) ok!
honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
(to phoebe) do you really find this attractive on him?
i think this is the first time in our marriage that I have felt like the more attractive one.
okay-dokay, you have each won a game and I have lost what is felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner.
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
(exhausted) ok, look! enough is enough!
monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you have already proven you are just as good as he is, now we have missed our dinner reservations, so now let us just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
but...
what about the obsessive cleaning?
you ok?
no, you did not.
because I am going to play for ya.
(in a loving voice) yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it is important to you then it is important to me, because i love you.
(still in a loving voice) you are welcome, sweetheart.
all right mike, let us get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins.
and that is... how... it is done!
i never sucked, i actually did not want you to know how good i was!
i do not know.
that is why!
that is great!
so you kissed her, so what happened after that?
so she is just waiting over there for ya?
(entering) oh hey rachel, sweetheart? you have got to tell the post office that you have moved. okay? we are still getting all your bills and stuff. (hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
I am not your garbage man. I am your mailman.
a pharmacist. (rachel mocks him.)
you took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
you made pottery?
ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…
…so then the farmer says, "that is not a cow and you are not milking it." (everyone laughs.)
look at us, we are a couple of couples!
yeah all right. (they part.) okay, good night guys.
and here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (hands it to him.) you were also going to buy monica flowers but you could not afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
oh that is too bad.
that is funny, i saw no phlegm.
then why-why is she going to a play?!
well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
so she was just pretending to have a good time last night? she was lying to our faces?!
and i am not blah, i am a hoot!
no, you sh—no you said you made that up!!
eh, they are both good. i generally just go with, monica’s drunk again. (monica glares at him.)
okay.
okay, one more time.
perfect decibel.
hey.
oh nothing, we are just talking. y’know, blah-blah-blah.
that is totally understandable.
oh yeah!
and I am blah? listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (imitating her) "oh chandler, i just lost myself in the moment."
(to monica) y’know i think you can take her.
did you hear that?
yeah, I am sorry man. (pause) you want to go watch?
hey so, did uh, did she move out?
you okay?
y’know what? it seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
phoebe is, making people.
and we just sit here. i mean if i die the only way people would even know i was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! look, we have to do something. okay? something huge!
no-no, not something stupid, something huge.
why not?! i mean it is just, it is just climbing! it is just, it is just steep!
we are going to everest! okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on everest!
yeah baby!
(dejected) yeah, well…
yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
(dejected) oh, well…
yeeeeahhhh.
but I will tell you something. one of these days we are get off of our buts and rent die hard again!
and i just want a million dollars! (he extends his hand hopefully.)
uh-oh.
she was not good. not good.
uh-oh.
(entering) hello!
(sarcastic) noo.
i did not know that.
see, maybe that is the one we should have actually hidden.
this is not one of those uh, y’know "if she does not come, we-we do not, we do not come?" right? because i already bought my ticket…
oh, that is ross's.
come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
(stuttering incoherently) f-hah.... flennin....
i knew it!!!!
ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
all right, check it out. check this out. it says here that there is a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (reading from the book.) "it is almost as good as being there."
well, you could, but... probably just the one time.
if we do that, we got to get die hard.
(entering, with a goatee) hey.
I am never going to find a roommate, ever.
well let us see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that is plural. the spitter. oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. nice to meet you, chandler bing bing! great apartment chandler bing, bing!
two. this photographer, who seemed really dull. and this actor guy, who I am not sure about, because when he called and i answered the phone ‘chandler bing,’ he said ‘whoa-whoa, short message.’
umm, how is it going with you guys?
soo, ah, eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
yes, that is cool. because i have models here y'know......never.
well, listen i ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, i think you are chances are pretty good. (eric offers to shake hands) all right. (chandler hugs him.)
(running around the apartment pointing out things) bedroom. bathroom. living room. this right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) bye-bye.
sure. ummm. what is up?
what gay thing?
well okay jerry, thanks for stopping by.
hey, mon.
do i ever.
no way!
just coffee! where are we going to hang out now?
(to bartender) can i get a beer.
you betcha!
um-mm, yeah right!
oh yes, and that is what i want a roommate that i can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
okay, but after that, we are shootin’ some pool.
excuse, i seem to have dropped my ball.
(picks it up) and now I have picked it up again. (walks over to monica.)
(leaving to go to work) hey!
oh, do not thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. okay, i got to get to get to work.
so ah, What are you watching?
what is it about?
well, it sounds kind of stupid... (looks at the tv) who is she?
wow! look at them run.
yeah, I will go get one.
well, hello!
do you have any beers? we are out of beers.
you okay?
right.
noo!! you do not have a boyfriend because....i do not, i do not know why you do not have a boyfriend. you should have a boyfriend.
oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I have ever known in real life.
umm, this is nice.
no, i mean it, this feels really good. is it a hundred percent cotton?
anyway, i should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) oh, and listen, it is, it is going to be....
ross-joey, joey-ross. (they shake hands)
i can not believe you came back.
hey.
someone on the subway licked my neck! licked my neck!!
what are you guys doing?
oooh, I am afraid that does not exist.
no, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who is going like this… (makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. henceforth, this shall be known as the face.)
i do not know what it is, i just can not take a good picture.
yeah, I am not in that.
all right, but i should warn you, I am not going. I am going. (does the face while saying that last part.)
how about those three pointers?
and those guys were this (doing the standard "this close" gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too.
yes, and we call ross lingers in the bathroom.
they have that on the napkins at the club.
rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? i mean y’know you can not date him right?
dude that is so sad.
could i play?
okay. (does the face.)
no, i am.
i do? (he smiles, beautifully.)
okay. (you will have to see it, i can not describe the face he makes, but it is not good.)
aww! (smiles.)
oh my god! those are my bedroom eyes?! why did you ever sleep with me?
i can not help it!
borrow money from me?
why is there jelly on your shoe?
hey!
(pause) I am right here!
I am still right here!
did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
can you people not see me?! (he waves his arms around to get their attention.)
there i am!
yeah, joey said i uh, i needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
yeah, and then i fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to brooklyn. brooklyn is f-far!!
i do not know, but do not worry, do not worry, because i know how to take a picture now. (they get ready) okay, see? look down (looks down), look down, look down… (he falls asleep.)
(awakens) yeah! (looks up and does the face.)
ahhh.
oh yeah, that looks good.
okay.
I am marrying her.
wow! pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
what are you writing?
oh yeah? (he grabs the pad and starts reading it.) joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?
hi guys!
without me?!
yes, but in ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that is it.
maybe that is because soy-burgers suck!
what are you talking about?
why are you in here if joshua is all the way over there? (points to the living room.)
like what?
i said, "like what?"
does for me.
flashdance.
she was a welder.
what are the odds? what are the odds?
okay.
there is a phoebe on my sandwich! (he walks away, giving the sandwich to phoebe.)
hey.
oh-ho, yeah!
okay, well tonight’s the big night.
it is going to be perfect. i am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I am going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I am just going to propose.
yeah.
I am not going to mess it up.
she is not going to say no.
hey!
(to phoebe) give me it!
phoebe!
(with his mouthful) hi monica.
hey!
(glaring at her) well, monica and chandler can not go. we are going to dinner remember?!
i just get mad when rachel does not remember where we are going.
well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
oh, so you are already doing your part for the kids.
wait a minute, all jokes aside? i did not agree to that!
will you marry me? will you marry me? (makes like a gun with his fingers.) hey, you marry me! (he gives up as joey, rachel, phoebe, and ross slink in all excited.) what is going on little elves?
yeah, right here in my pocket. (pats his pocket. phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) pheebs?
okay, now will you guys get out of here? i want this is to be a surprise and she is going to know.
(to monica) you are beautiful.
(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) one nation, under god. indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (laughs.) i remembered it. (it is a butchered version of the pledge of allegiance of the united states for our foreign friends.) the champagne is here. (the waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
yes! yes! I am good! are you good? are you good? is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
oh, yeah. (starts to take it off and then realizes) uh, no you can not have my jacket! because then i would be cold! if you thought that you were going to be cold, you should have brought your own jacket. but uh, other than that, are you okay? are you okay?
yes! I am fine. in fact I have been fine for a long time now and i think, the reason is you.
okay umm, before i meant you i had really little life and i could not imagine growing old with…
(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) i know, but just let me say it.
what?! I am chandler! (she nods towards the doorway, chandler turns and looks) oh, that is richard!
hey-hey, hey! (gets up and hugs him.) i do not know why i did that!
(to richard’s date) and uh, you do not have a mustache which is good. (she just smiles.) I am chandler; i make jokes when I am uncomfortable.
hi.
richard! no one supposed to know about us! (richard just smiles at him.) see i, did it again.
yeah, I will sit down. (he slides back into his chair.)
yes. (thinking he is gone.)
i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
what?!
(stopping him from going any further) before you say anything, have we got a story for you! guess who we bumped into at dinner!
richard!
oh you knew that. good!
for camp!
hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if you are not careful you may not get married at all this year!
(after the door closes) what did you guys just do?!
richard was there so i could not do it!
I am going to do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you have ruined it!
who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
this is terrible. what am i going to do?
that is right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
i can do that, I have had 30 years of practice.
okay, okay, here she comes! (sits on the couch next to him.) how do i look? do i look like a guy who does not want to get married?
hey!
oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (joey laughs.) yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
yeah, well… y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
eh…
sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. let us take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs do not mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that is just an ordinary pig not even a pig that is good at sports!
if marriage worked, I would be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why do not you put down your copy of ‘the rules’ huh mantrap?!
(to them) it is okay, i got a plan.
i was making a coconut phone with the professor.
what?!
my—oh my god!
he is not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I am supposed to do that!
well what… y’know what I am going to do? I am going to go over there; I am going to kick his ass! (pause) will you help me?!
you are right.
okay. (starts running for the bedroom) I am going to get the ring! I am going to get the ring! (does so) I am going to go find her and (starts running for the door) I am just going to propose!
okay great.
what?!
where is she? I am not scared of you! (averts his eyes and walks in.)
(examining the coffee table) scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? ha-ha, monica! monica!
well where did she go?
oh my god, i can not believe this! y’know, i thought…i thought you were a good guy.
nothing happened? nothing? so you did not tell my girlfriend that you love her?
y’know what? i can not believe this! do you know what you did? my girlfriend is out there thinking things over! you made my girlfriend think!!
and what does she have to think about? i love her!
but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, y’know? a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things, she would be surprised!
it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this is not fair. you had your chance with her! you had your chance and you blew it! and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! and this is all just been one stupid mistake! (sits down heavily.) i was going to propose tonight.
yeah i even (pause) got a ring. (puts in on the center cushion.) did you get a ring?
y’know richard…you are a good guy.
i can not talk to you now, i got to find monica!
what?
what are you talking about?
well why did not you stop her?! why did not you just tell her it was a plan?!
well where… where did she go?
i can not believe i ruined this.
oh my god.
okay! (he joins her on one knee) okay! okay! oh god, i thought… (starting to cry, pauses) wait a minute, i-i can do this. (pause) i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you, (pause) you make me happier than i ever thought i could be. (starting to cry again.) and if you will let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (pause as he gets out the ring.) monica, will you marry me?
hey.
and this from the cry-for-help department. are you wearing makeup?
that is so funny, because i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man slash woman.
do you know which one you are going to be?
good luck, man. i hope you get it.
yes, every single one of them.
i thought it was $98.50.
I would just like to say that I am totally behind this experiment. in fact, I would very much like to butter your head.
all right, I am nine years old.
we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they are getting divorced.
yes. it is very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you have seen it in reverse.
tonight, on a very special blossom.
oh, you must stop shooping.
no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that is not funny anymore.
the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away.
no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it is all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. I am going to the roof, who is with me?
come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen?
do either of you have the keys?
(sarcastic) for an emergency just like this.
ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go.
now this feels like thanksgiving.
shall i carve?
ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I would like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this is not the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you would gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you did not have syphilis and stuff, we would not be all together, you know? so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.
here, here!
(browsing through a diary) well, let me see... i-i believe I am... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv.
i could fall asleep at a play.
(browsing through a diary) uh, let us see, who do i hate?
hey!
yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
(to monica) no, i think we are just blurry shapes to him now.
where the hell is everybody?
(to himself) oh yes, god yes!!
i... i do not know... you seem lovely.
(to monica) so, how did you enjoy the play?
well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why would not i, because as a man I have been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) but after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", i was uplifted.
oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!
did somebody sign your bra?
oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you.
can not believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).okay, our news. my company has asked me to head up our office in tulsa , so as of monday I am being officially relocated.
they said it could be up to a year.
there is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
I am sorry buddy, but i do not think I am going to be able to make it.
really?
(enters) hey!
I have got good news!
okay, i have news. you do not have to move to tulsa. you can stay here and keep your job.
I am sorry, are you just used to saying that?
really?
that is fast math! we could use you in tulsa.
hey, you said that without gagging!
i know what she is talking about.
he saw a therapist?
hey!
looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa.
slim pickings.
no, 'slim pickings', it is a barbecue restaurant. they are looking for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they are looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
'so cheesy' also has an opening.
can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me. when we get to tulsa I am taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings'. 'so cheesy'? 'whole hog'? it is going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa.
honey, we are leaving tomorrow you have still got a lot of packing to do.
what?
how far outside?
and you are thinking of taking it? (pause) so before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but i guess now it is old job, (raises his hand) me, (raises his hand) new job.
what happened to 'you can not live without me four days a week'?
i think you should take the job.
yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
that was not a security blanket! that was a wall-hanging!
well, you got here just in time. i really have to go buddy. (they hug)
of course i will call you. i love you.
awww. (they hug) bye!
(tries to hug joey but j. moves away) what is the matter joe?
any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
well, bye mon, bye ross, rachel, bye emma!
i know.
i know that too. (they kiss)
(on cell phone) do not worry, I will be back before you know it. yes it will be the same. because i know, that is how. i promise.
(looking at her) seriously, answer faster!
(to phoebe) it is like a giant hug.
(picking up the phone) hello.
oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, I am stuck at the office all day.
those are all really old!
hi!
i was in the car with nancy all day.
well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
it is perfect. it is everything we have been looking for.
and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) what were the things you said?
and the fireplace in the bedroom.
this is bringing out a lovely color in you!
i do not know. what do you think?
i do too.
i know.
i do not know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day.
we do not. not until it is a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
i know. gooooood luck with it.
hey!
is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I am not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
actually, we already found a house we love.
bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh?
i know this is really hard and we are really sorry.
(goes towards joey) you know that is not the reason joe. (joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. he goes back to where he was standing before)
hey, that is...'joincidence' with a 'c'!
if you win, we give up the birds.
but if we win, we get your apartment.
dangerous liaisons.
fancy.
fancy guest.
thanks man.
would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!
(to monica) wow! listen, we had a good run. you know, what was it? four? five months? i mean, that is more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (he kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica.
look, we are not just messing around! i love her. okay, I am in love with her.
(entering) hey.
i know. (he kisses her.)
no problem roomie. (she turns around and hugs him.)
sure!
little toast here. i know this is not exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you would gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you did not have syphilis and stuff, we would not be all together, you know? so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.
here, here!
hello? it is nancy, they responded to our offer.
(to nancy) okay, thanks... (to monica) they passed. they said they would not go a penny under the asking price.
i know.
that is okay, we understand.
yeah... well, it is a good thing we got it then.
we got the house.
i just did not want to tell you in front of them.
we are getting the house. (they hug) we are getting the house.
we are growing up.
so who is going to tell them?
not it! damn it!
you will see.
well, i did not know how to tell you before, but... we got the house.
(answering the phone at work) hello, chandler bing.
(angrily) alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (ross and joey laugh silently.) it is been six months! it is not funny!
leave me alone! for the love of god, leave me alone!!! (joey hangs up.)
the british are coming?
ohh.
why?
yes! chandler bing, 7! chandler bing, 0.
okay, I will stop.
you want to play?
well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
I am intrigued.
okay, but be careful okay, because i want to get our security deposit back.
do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) oh yeah, it is great! see you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid—op! op! (he puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
(entering from his bedroom) guys, come on! let us go! the puck drops in 20 minutes! come on, joe!
well, why can not you do them tomorrow?
(to ross) why do not you cut him a little slack? okay? maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he will get some work done.
the only reason you are doing this to joey is because you are bored. okay, it is not his fault that you are unemployed.
oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
i paid for those tickets!
oh yeah! (makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
when did that happen to you?!
oh yeah. first off all, chasing the churo guy is not jogging.
okay, bye! (to the gang.) oh my god!!
i do not believe they are brother and sister.
oh hey! there is some kids playing in the street, you want to go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
great! now, we can go to the ranger game! (pause) last night!
yeah or also when you do not have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day!!
all right. (takes a copy.)
what is up?
no, it was me. I am sorry. i over reacted.
could i be more sorry. (looks at joey.)
(to ross) I am sorry too.
i am sorry, ross.
this took you all day?!
let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? i remember when people used to use big lights.
i dunno what it is, it just does not quite feel like christmas to me.
see now it feels like christmas!
hey joe what is up?
i can see why that is hard to resist.
you are aware that she is not a monkey, right?
ah, you are still just a little fat girl inside are not you? (he kisses her on the cheek)
what, what are you laughing at?
i do not think so.
(to rachel) oh my god!
i can save you time ladies, I am right here.
what? that is terrible!
oh well, that makes it not terrible.
no not okay, you can not look for monica’s presents!
no, you do not have to, and you can not because i live here too.
why?
no, i have a great idea for a present for her.
if i help, we can find ‘them faster!
y’know when you guys said you were going to go across the hall and look, you do not, you do not do that every year do you?
you do not, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
because that is where joey gave me some stuff to store that I have never seen before in my life! okay, that did not just happen! (he does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kind of hard to describe.)
i could not find anything at joey--hey-hey, oh hey!
those are my gifts, i got them for you.
those are book ends! that is a great gift!
make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
oh, hey guys!
yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
oh, the duck seems to think that monica got me garbage! hmm, i wonder what i could get monica that is as good as garbage?
what?
oh great!
okay! okay! okay!
wait, we can not do this.
i do not want to know what monica got me. y’know? i mean, look, I am sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are going to ruin that, and i, look we have to put these back, this is not what christmas is about.
nobody is opening anything ok? look, i do not know about you guys, but i want to see the look on monica’s face when i give her my present, and I am sure she wants to see the look on my face when i get mine. so please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
fine!
that is what you got me?
now you do that, you are on tv.
uh, if i were omnipotent for a day, I would.. make myself omnipotent forever.
you got waaaay too much free time.
happy birthday, pal!
well, are not we mr. "the glass is half empty."
eleven days before halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
(trying to stop ross leaving) c'mon, ross! you, me, joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (pretending to punch him in the stomach.) huh? huh? huh?
(stops) i have no idea.
you got it.
(looking) oh, this is not that bad.
...poulet passes it up to leetch! (passes it to joey.)
we will take a brief time out while messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
yes, bunny?
(to joey) could have been a peach.
what? there was ice there that night with carol? plastic seats? four thousand angry pittsburgh fans?
(to ross) see buddy, that is all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
he is open!
hey, look, we are on that tv thing!
(to the receptionist)'scuse me.
listen, it is kind of an emergency. well, i guess you know that, or we would be in the predicament room. (the receptionist glares at him.)
excuse me, look, we have been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. i mean, that guy with the toe thing? who is he sleeping with? (she slides the gladd panel over and chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) oh, c'mon dora, do not be mad... i know we both said some things we did not mean, but that does not mean we still do not love each other. (to the waiting room.) y'know, i feel like I have lost her.. (she slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) ba-!
yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- could i get some painkillers over here, please?
well, what? what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women? that she left you for another woman that likes women?
then what?
so in your whole life, you have only been with one—(he gets a look too)—oh.
i think it is great. y'know, it is sweet, it is romantic...
no, you kidding? the guy's a freak.. (ross enters off camera)
oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs. oh come on, admit it! all things considered, you had fun tonight.
you got to do it, man.
thanks. (the guy nods and leaves)
hello? oh, uh, rachel, it is the visa card people.
alright. (on phone) yes, this is rachel.
to the left, to the left- aww! (they all collapse)
hey.
monica and i are engaged.
thanks.
(to ross) okay, you get her in here. (to joey) you bolt the door. I will be in the closet.
it is okay, i want this to be your night too. (raises his class.) to monica.
to monica!
so when you said, "get up early," did you mean 1986?
okay.
know what i mean?
there is going to be a wedding. you are going to be the bride. two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
(motioning with his hands) I am not worried, I am uh, I am fascinated. y’know it is like uh, biology! which is funny because in high school i uh, i-i failed biology and tonight biology failed me. (exits as phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
sure, you guys do not have this problem, you are made of wood. (rachel comes out of the bathroom) hey!
you look great!
you okay over there?
oh, do not worry about it i mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
(putting his hands up) take whatever you want, just please do not hurt me.
yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
young! you are a man-child okay?! now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
joe?
uhh, you have had a lot of sex right?
well, it is just the reason that I am asking is because i kind of eh, uh, i was unable to—i mean i really wanted too, but i could not…. there huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
it is happened to you?
well, what did you do?
(angrily) i do not think that is what they were talking about joe!!
what?!
yes, you can pass for 19.
yes!
seriously? seriously, no! you can play your own age which is 31!
now monica, i know you are upset, but do not forget. there is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there is going to be a honeymoon, maybe in paris.
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la (mumbles something).
then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because it is romantic, but because i can!
okay, do not say anything, you might scare it away.
it is paris, who knows we are here!
pheebs, we are not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i do not care!
what a great apology! (to monica) and you accept! okay, bye-bye!
(entering) ahh, third base.
(to ross) why to save your dignity my man.
well, somebody should. (monica glares at him.)
how is that ever going to happen?!
(to ross) i do not care, she slept with me.
thanks.
(interrupting her just in time) hey! here is a dollar, consider it a deposit. please sing at our wedding.
okay. (goes back to bed.)
you are an actor!
(entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) monica! can i talk to you for a second? listen, i appreciate you getting me the costume…
the velveteen rabbit was brown and white!
no bunny at all!! always no bunny at all!!!
how is that me?
when have i ever done that?!
wow! i do not have the worst costume anymore!
oh! hi!
joey’s going to be thrilled! he was hoping you would come by as a slutty nurse.
you would think that would embarrass me, but you see I am maxed out.
(to ross) marry her.
how do you doody.
oh relax man, relax. you are looking a little flushed.
what question?
there is no question.
(to monica) you picked ross?!
i cannot believe you did not pick me.
oh really?! you think you are stronger? why do not you prove it? (he pushes ross who starts to fall backwards until mona catches him.)
(to ross) you are going down.
that means nothing to me. (to ross) come on!
and dignity.
nope! i can do this all day.
god, I am exhausted.
no way! if anything you have got to let me win! my wife thinks I am a wimp!
you are spudnik.
fine. (he let us ross win.) oh no!
listen, I have got a secret for ya. i let him win.
no, i let him win—ross!
would you tell her i let you win please?
i am strong! I will show you! (he sits down at the table.)
oh what is the matter? are you scared?
okay. 1…2…3—go! (once again he is at a stalemate, but this time he is in pain.) (pause) I am going to kill myself!
oh, richard. that is all i ever hear, richard, richard, richard!
okay, so richard, richard!
what?
how much did i love the king and i? (oh, you get the point by now.)
you okay there man?
wow umm, calm down.
uh, no pheebs. what is it look like?
you got the lead in a movie? that is amazing! what is the movie about?!
yeah, i know that means buddy!
well, uh, we can talk about that too pheebs.
whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
all right, great, road trip baby! (to monica) this okay with you?
thank you.
(entering) hey!
yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? do i need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
what?
hey, so where are we staying? is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
i see, but once you get your first paycheck you will be springing a big hotel suite, right? i mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
so you do not get paid unless the movie makes money?
all right, bye-bye now!
okay!
we have been driving for a half-hour, and you have not looked at the road once.
yeah.
is not that ross's money?
i do not know.
okay!
too dry.
no!
no!
yes.
i also said, "yes!"
no! (realizes) ahhh!!!
look joe, i just, i just do not want to get your hopes up real high.
they are not even paying ya! this does not even sound like a real movie!
joe, i do not think this is going to be your big break.
oh, you do not want me on the trip?
all right, I will tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I will lie.
all right, fine! fine! why do not you pull over? I will get out right now!
you are not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
all right!! (gets out and joey speeds away.) wait! wait, there is no sidewalk! yeah, I am going to die here.
(entering) hey!
joey kicked me out of the car on the george washington bridge!
i do not know! he went crazy! y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
well, i do not know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, i did not think this was not going to be his big break, that this movie was not going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it did not sound like a real movie--okay, he should have pushed me off of the bridge.
oh, i figured you guys would all be mad at me. so i got you some gifts that i found on the side of the road. (looks into the bag.) who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
(who has just entered) is that joey? is that joey? let me talk to him! i want to talk to him!
y'know, he will not even talk to me. how am i going to apologize to him if he will not even talk to me?
that is a good idea. i wonder where i could (pause) get a basket of porn…
really?
ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
where did you, when did you, how did you... (joey hits the back of chandler's head) how did you get a girl like that?
okay, but that is, like, the easiest era.
hi. you guys have any wrapping paper?
phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
well, i have a call in about that.
actually, this is for kathy's birthday. it is an early edition of her favorite book.
okay, but do not touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
oh, it was not a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
it does not say that. does it?
okay, all right, I will just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great.
it is okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (kathy goes into the bathroom.) hey joe! what are you getting kathy for her birthday?
(confused) sure...
i do not know... um, grease?
rent?
okay, so when do you want to go?
yes, it is, at office max.
a pen.
huh-huh! you can not give her that.
because she is not eleven! and it is not the seventh night of hanukkah!
all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday?
for three years?
all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay?
would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called "invisible things for kathy." (motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
she is really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i do not get to be the one who gives it to her.
yeah? you do not think it is just pathetic?
where?
i got something for her. (joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can not hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) it is a book!
no, it is a book that is just a book, okay? it is an early edition of the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
no, it came out to an even twenty.
hey, how did it go? how did she like the gift?
oh yeah? that is great!
[nodding, with mixed feelings] aahhuuhhh....
hey! happy birthday.
no he did not. [moving it back.]
happy birthday! I am sorry.
see, you think it is just a pen, but then you turn it over and it is also a clock.
oh, yeah... yeah.
[to kathy] goodnight.
oh, uh, yeah... i just knew that sometimes when you are writing, you... you do not always know the exact time.
uh, the book?
what do you mean?
(tongue-tied) uhl..ell. by the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "uhl, ell."
oh, yeah, he is my... he is my best friend.
goodnight. (goes to his room.)
i can not believe you would actually say that. i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty.
i feel violated. and not in a good way.
i am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. it was unbelievable! we could totally be ourselves, we did not have to play any games...
let her know i like her? what are you, insane? (the girls make disgusted noises.) it is the next day! how needy do i want to seem? (to the guys) I am right, right?
which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat. (calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) i got her machine.
no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase "yes indeedy-of."
(bluffing) and basically, that is how a bill becomes a law.
hey rach!
yes!
i have my reasons.
(on phone, reading from a script) oh, danielle! i was not expecting the machine... give me a call when you get a chance. (rattles some dishes) bye-bye. (hangs up.) oh god!
hey, I have been honing!
oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like i have not been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
what are you looking at me for? i did not know that.
can i use your phone?
yes, it is working! why is not she calling me back?
y'do not think that makes me seem a little...
ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
she answered.
I am not going to talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now I am needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy.
if it helps, i could slide over.
hello? hello?
so how is mindy?
hell is filled with people like you.
...and boogie!
okay, I am going to go to the bathroom. will you watch my phone?
hey, we have not been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
i can not call her, i left a message! i have some pride.
no! (calls) danielle, hi! it is, uh, it is chandler! (listens) I am fine. uh, listen, i do not know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that i am, i accidentally shut off my phone. (listens) oh, uh, okay, that is fine, that is great. (listens) okay. (puts down the phone.) (to monica) she is on the other line, she is going to call me back. (he starts doing a little jig.) she is on the other line, she is going to call me back, she is on the other line, going to call me back...
's'why I am dancing...
ring dammit, ring!
what?!
(investigating) i turned it off. mother of god, i turned it off!
nngghhh!!!!!!!
danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody.
what are you doing here?
...I am, I am okay.
that sounds good. I will call you- or you call me, whatever...
okay.
...i dunno.
well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if i was okay? i mean,... how needy is that?
hey!
y’know I am-I am really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
y’know i was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering?!
that is me! come on!
well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
(transfixed) hi! nice to meet you!
I will be right with you.
i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. it is called being a good conversationalist. watch. (stares at monica’s eyes.) say something.
umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
you are flingin'-flangin' right i am!
well, it is official there are no good movies.
hey, man. what is up?
well, I will tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it was not me.
is anybody else scared?
get the woman a pad! get the woman a pad! a pad! a pad!
(entering with his ringing phone) joe. joe! answer the phone.
just do it! okay, it is janice and if i get it I am going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) oh, that is great I am going to have to see her tonight.
okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
noo.
no, it is like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm started going off in my head: 'run for your life! get out of the building!'
i know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that is why i do not want to go tonight, I am afraid I am going to say something stupid.
look what do i do? i want to get past this, i do not want to be afraid of the commitment thing. i want to go through the tunnel, to the other side!
do we have any...(turns around and bumps monica's fake chest) do we have any thoughts here?
you think?
yeah, joe, i assure you if I am staring down the barrel of a gun, I am pretty much peeing every which way.
because, i wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)
well, wait there is, there is more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you are my girlfriend, and that is what girlfriends should, should get.
well, not me. but that is what is happened, and, ah, and, and there is more. we should take a trip.
yep, we are a couple and that is what couples do. and, i want to meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents!
i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that I am here it is like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let us move in together.' and I would be okay.
it does not scare me!
oh, no, no, no, do not go! I have scared ya'! I have said too much! I am hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (janice leaves, chandler then calls janice to leave a message on her machine) hey, janice! it is me. um, yeah, i-i-i just want to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
then i got all needy and clingy.
she said she would call me.
oh god.
this ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
so, you do not think I am terminal?
okay, okay. so, should i call her?
so I am not, not going to lose her?
i said, 'so I am not going to lose her?'
(in a british accent) hello, janice.
(in accent) oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been?
(normal voice) no. not anymore.
yeah, huh. I am just uh, you know I am just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
well, I am sorry if my friends are not as sophisticated as yours.
here in chelsea.
a woman's
(shyly) chelsea.
can i be that guy?
....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
I have actually ruined this have not i? it is time for the good ice cream now, right?
(answering phone) hello. hi, janice! can you hold on for a second? okay. (to monica and rachel) okay, what do i do?
hello!
what are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) hello, janice. hi, I am so glad that you called, i know I have been acting a really weird lately. and, it is just because I am crazy about you, and i just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I am sorry. (listens) really?! (listens) really?!
(on phone) i love you too.
hey!
you look great. I am so glad we are having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them.
no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the actual wedding.
(to rachel) you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we are doing in the wedding tomorrow.
heh.
this is like figure skating team all over again. (phoebe and ross glare at him astonished) i mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) i mean- i mean the balance beam. (to ross) help me!
thank you.
i know, i hate being left out of things.
fine. we are just sitting here. alone. doing nothing. it is our rehearsal for tomorrow.
what happened?
(standing up too) m-me-me-me!
pick me, i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus.
oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me!
you are going downer!
(almost crying) i would not know, i did not make it! (they hug)
mike did not tell you? you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out.
just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he will walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you will be getting some comedy!
let me tell you why you need to pick me. (goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who did not even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if I am the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are going to come rushing back.
(getting up and raising his fist in victory) y-y-yeeesss! make "groom" for chandler.
how is it going?
(smiling to himself too) that is what i was doing too.
you too.
me too.
I am not supposed to tell you.
you told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at rachel)
rach, rach, knock knock.
I will tell you at the wedding.
so technically, would this person be in the wedding?
I am not scared. (moves towards mike and chappy) I will just take little chappy and... (he backs out) he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed.
(quickly) I will do it.
(to ross) na ha ha... (to chappy) ne he he... (ross moves chappy to chandler, who quickly backs away) ah ah...
(to monica) is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
oh yeah! (monica walks outside)
ready?
okay.
wow! are not you going to be cold?
you look beautiful.
that really was an incredible wedding.
I would love to, but it is 2300 hours and I am about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
i do not know. maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
you!
well the vet seems to think that is she is becoming a rooster. (the rooster crows.) we are getting a second opinion.
oh, i can uh, check that for ya.
i can check that for ya.
well… we-we do. you can only eat tic tacks in even numbers.
(to rachel) and you… ross, i believe, if you check rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
(to ross) stop that now!
yes!
diet soda.
orange juice.
oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (whispers something in joey’s ear.)
i got it! scotch… tape. (they are right.)
well, we used there is up last night making scary faces.
all right! ten buck! fork it over! cough it up! pay the piper! give me it.
fears and pet peeves.
his legs flail about as if independent of his body!
she has a real name.
althea?! what are you doing?!
you are shooting with althea?!
nice shooting!
actually, it is miss chinandolor bong.
unfortunately that is correct.
i majored in lightning rounds. all right, we are going to destroy you.
well, I am so confused as to what we have been doing so far…
say 200?
(interrupting) all right, hold on! if you win, we give up the birds.
but if we win, we get your apartment.
okay. (starts jumping around.)
dangerous liaisons.
oh! (whispers something in joey’s ear and then in ross’s ear.)
fancy.
fancy guest.
thanks man.
you can not just call monica’s room.
oh, i would never bet this apartment. it is too nice.
hey!
yeah, but i bet it works.
well believe it baby!
i knew it!
cool, girl roommate.
would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!
what?! what-what is it?!
i can not believe we live here!
die hard still great!
what did you rent?
(looking at the tape) joey, this is die hard 1 again.
yeah, i just got uh, got plans.
no, see the thing is i want to get out of here before joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
that is sweet.
so uh, what did this woman look like?
well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
no, no i only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (thinks a little while.) hold on one second; let me check this out. (he gets up and grabs a photo album.
well, let us see… (finding the picture he wants.) okay uh, is that her? (pointing to the picture.)
julie grath, my camp girlfriend.
(pause) no, we are still together. yeah we went out for two summers, and then i broke up with her.
well, ‘because she came back the third summer and she would gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
i did not say fat! i said, "fa-aa-aw-ow…"
yeah. yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! does she still feel bad?
well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (monica is not amused by that statement.) seriously, good luck marrying me.
can you figure out what I am doing?
who?
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.
okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
(she opens the door) julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me.
(to monica) it is a nickname, I will explain later.
ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
you-you-you did not know that. (pause as she nods no.) well, i guess my work here is done!
as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that I am going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.
i would really love it if could do both.
what?
what?!
a hundred and forty-five pounds.
look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!
okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!
look you have to realize i do not think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (monica glares at him.) see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is you are monica! okay? and i am in love with monica.
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.
I would carry you around in my pocket.
skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
(entering) hey, does anybody need anything copied? I am going down to the xerox place.
okay listen, just give me anything i can make two of.
yeah! you want to come?
come on chloe! finish up with your customer first. come on chloe! come on chloe!!
uh-oh.
(to joey) okay, that hurt us.
well ah, ........y'know.
all right, rock on. (does the ‘hang 10’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)
hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. i mean what time did chloe say we should be there?
what time is it now?
yeah all right, so we will hang out.
yes. vividly.
yeah, i-i-i think so. (pauses and thinks about it for a second) yeah, i-i think so...
yeah. yeah, i mean what, what would we do?
she was kidding.
she was.... but y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
yeah. good call, nice one. hold it!! hold it! what if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
right. right. well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
well it you do not know that, then i do not want to do this with you.
and that is the only colour that comes in.
so, what are you doing here? i thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
hey, no way! come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
hey, this is not like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
why? what happened to him?
(quietly) hi! (they both start kissing.)
uhh, 9. (he pushes the clock into the sink.)
i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? y'know we would have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
okay, y'know your not though. let us go. (he starts for his bedroom.)
I am not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it is a fake conference? it is a real conference.
what is going on?
uh, hey!
we are flipping monica's mattress.
aww, man! (they go into monica's room.)
oh yes, somebody just said, "can you hear anything?"
condoms?
and condoms are the way to do that?
(jumping on the bed) i can not believe it! we are here!
oh, you should live with joey, roll-os everywhere.
oh yes! monica, get in here! there is a high-speed car chase on!
(looks at what she is holding and shies away) oh dear god, they gave us glasses!
okay, but let us do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it is feed! (he grabs their bags and sprints out.)
okay, great. (he grabs the remote and turns on the tv to the chase.)
half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
what? why?
uh-huh. (he does not take his eyes off the tv.)
(turning to face her) yeah.
i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so i can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
(watching tv, in fact, er is on.) nothing! it is over! dammit! this is regularly scheduled programming!
oh, I am sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
do not speak ill of the dead.
i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom.
i said, "geez, relax monnnnn."
damn rollos!
hey.
it was terrible. i fought with (pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. are you kidding with this? (throws away another rollo)
uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator.
well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
monica. (follows her out.)
okay, fine, $300.
yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
hi!
okay, ross is in the bathroom.
kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
(entering) hey!
yes that was mine.
yes that would have made more sense.
(entering) hey!
i just came over to drop off…nothing. so that weekend kind of sucked, huh?
so, i guess this is over.
well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
because of the weekend, we had a fight.
so, this is not over?
really? okay. great!
(stops her) we are in a relationship?
okay.
joey, can i talk to you for a second? (he grabs him and starts to drag joey into monica's room.)
yes. yes. (let us him up.)
it happened in london.
the reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a big deal out of it.
no-no-no-no-no! you can not!
fun's over!
(watches joey for a moment) okay! (joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he is scratching his back with it.) listen, I am going to be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
first of the month.
no, just the months you actually want to live here.
okay, here is the phone bill. (hands it to joey.)
that is our phone number. now look, i know i kind of sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why do not i just—why do not i just cover you for a while?
it is not charity, joe…
okay uh, here is the electric bill. (hands it to him.)
uh, yeah.
so, we will do the rest of the bills later then?
no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he would not take it.
i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? but i have to trick him into taking it so i will not hurt his pride.
well that would help the pride thing.
hey! wow! you look great! want to move in with me tomorrow?
okay! (they kiss) so, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
hey!
well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we would do nothing.
oh nope, i-i have plans with joey.
yes, but for the last time.
he is at a dinner party.
oh, i wish I would know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese.
say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
yes it would. what do you say to $50?
okay, let us play! the big game, italy vs. china, apparently.
okay, give me a chance to win my money back. okay? sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
oh yes!
okay.
no! no! no! no—(joey looks at him)—one can beat me.
see? now, that is why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
still broken?
well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack? (holds up a deck of cards.)
okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? we could play a new game. a new game, it is fun.
cups.
I will teach ya! come on, come on, it is really easy and really, really fun.
okay, here you go. (he deals out two cards each.) i have two queens, what do you have?
ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
oh yeah! okay, let us play again. (he deals out two cards each again.) what do you got?
you are kidding right?
well that is a full cup! (pays him again.)
you win.
it does not matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far?
not 700 exactly?
double it! (he does.)
well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
hey, i did not make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (joey gets excited.) do not get to excited because that is not going to happen unless you get—no way! (he takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. of course, any card would have won. chandler pays him.)
what is wrong?
wh-how did you lose at cups?!
oh man!!
all right, let us play one more hand! one more!
i can not take the big white dog! you love it!
no, but wait—what if i bought it from you, y’know? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (gets choked up) $1,500?
when did i try to give you money?
I am just trying to help you out! okay? i want to make sure that you are okay.
(entering) hey.
i know. (he kisses her.)
no problem roomie. (she turns around and hugs him.)
sure!
i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money.
exactly.
it is not a real game! i made it up!
at a fake game!!
okay! now i assume the saucer card came up when you played last.
hmm, let us see if it comes up this time. (he looks at his cards and shrugs.)
you know, I would love to, but I am a little tired.
you are on!
he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
she is cheating on joey with ross!
wow!
how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? no-one is manning that wall!
anything?
you do realise that is your brother?
that is not true. i came with monica and I am leaving with weird al.
okay buckwheat!
and she is... turning on the tv... and watching... miss congeniality!
(caresses the wall with his finger) bye!
he is probably in his room with his current girlfriend charlie. that is the situation as we know it... (walks to phoebe and monica)
you got it!
okay, well we will go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you?
enunciate!
hey!
not quite. monica's still at the salon, and I am just finishing packing.
you are not supposed to take that. besides, it is a new testament, what are you going to do with it?
hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
i think.... i think i can see your scalp.
what d'ya know... it is a treat for the eyes and the ears.
yeah, it is almost if air barbados does not care about your social life.
wish i could switch with someone. i really do not want to sit with allen iverson over there.
you go back to work tomorrow night, right?
so if you want people to see them, then by definition you are not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
what are you singing?
it is "ride of the valkyries" from "apocalypse now"... see, here is the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we are home, we do not have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them!
did i? let us refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.
again, let us journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey did not realise that there was anything different.
hit yourself in the tooth?
honey, you have been in there for a long time... is everything okay?
really? what happened?
you can not move at all?
if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
(trying to untangle her) some of these look a little frayed.
now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
i think you know.
this is what i want to do.
(picks up the "miss congeniality" dvd) she is an fbi agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
toootal chick-flick.
they are still just friends, right?
i can not believe we are even having this discussion.
i mean, do not you think if things were going to happen with rachel, they would have happened already?
i can not remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey.
hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
rachel lost marcel.
okay, it is his first time out, so he is probably going to want to do some of the touristy things. I will go to cats, you go to the russian tea room.
marcel?
marcel?
um, we are kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
yes have you seen any?
oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! and they are very hot.
okay, from now on, you do not get to talk to other people.
marcel?!
eh. i thought that was an alp.
yeah, well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys. any sex i had would have involved a major lifestyle choice.
hi!
man, if only you would gotten here sooner. (ross turns and glares at him.)
yeah?
okay.
okay. I have been thinking about it too, and i, i think we are ready.
but you said you were ready too.
yes, but have not you wanted a kid like forever?
I am not crazy about babies. I am crazy about us.
look, we have always talked about having babies someday. I am not saying it has to be right now, but I am starting to think that we can handle it. we are good. we are really good.
but nothing has to happen until your ready.
what?! it is not right! we are not ready to have a kid now!!
I am kidding. this is going to be fun.
we are trying to get pregnant. (they start kissing, but chandler stops it.) y’know I am not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. so, when do you want to start trying?
period math?
yeah.
right here?
wait a minute, it is perfect. we got a lot of time to kill and we are in a building that is full of beds!
okay. (they start kissing.)
okay. uh, we will dim the lights, dim the lights. (he goes to the light switch and finds it is not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) or turn them out all together. uh, no scented candles. okay here. here we go. (he sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)
yes, 98.6. you are going to be fine.
should we tell rachel there is an empty private room right next door to hers?
well let me think about that, while i remove my pants!
if it is not, then there is two of them. and that would mean it is the end of the world!
hi.
weirdest thing. did i hear—(a nurse opens the privacy screen and chandler sees janice)—mother of god it is true!
jan-janice!
janice i did not even know you were pregnant! who is the unwitting human who is essence you have stolen?
what?!
that is funny. does it-does it hurt? does the labor hurt?
it is incredible, i mean one minute she is inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
so, do you know what you are going to call her yet?
so then i guess ferdinad is out.
you do?
oh no, it is going to be named after some snack or baked good is not it?
that was amazing.
and if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
hey, I am sorry, i should have given you guys my black book when i got married! although it was not so much a book as a... napkin. with janice's phone number on it.
(he enters) hey honey!
is monica not here?
oh, then I will tell you. my agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! it is my first national commercial!
yeah, and i do not want to brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) hell, you were not there? all the ideas were mine!!!
oh... i do not know, i really do not think you are right for the part.
first of all. bravo. uh, but i really do not think you are right for this. the part calls for a stuffy college professor.
software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
hey you guys.
joe, i told you, you are just not right for the part.
joe...
fine!
work, joe!
he is not right for the part. so if i suggest him, my bosses are going to think I am an idiot! and that is something they should learn on their own!
that is good! i liked it, they did not. (he sees joey out of the window hitting on a girl) joey, for god's sake, go to work! (joey runs away).
hey joe!
bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they were not interested.
(hands the tape back to him) I am sorry man.
(sounds nervous) yeah! i... i... i liked it! (joey continues to look at him suspiciously) but, ehm... my bosses did not go for it. stupid sons of bitches!
(looks surprised) what!? of course i did!
I am not lying to you, i watched it!
i watched it!
(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) i did!
(following him) I am telling you, i watched the tape. (reaches joey's room and joey slams the door in his face)
in a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone) no!
i can not believe joey. i hate being called a liar!
what did i just say?
yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am insulted. when i tell somebody i did something...
why are you so sure i did not watch this tape?
he really is a chameleon.
look, I am sorry i did not give them your tape. and i promise, next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not.
i know. you are right. what is it going to take for you to forgive me?
lying is wrong!
I am a pretty little girl.
if i was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
(to janice) do not look honey. change the channel! change the channel!
what a wank!
(leaning in) I will go.
see, that is why i could never be an actor. because i can not say gig.
knock, knock.
hey, I am going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
okay. (to monica) it is a racecar.
okay, well it this bed is not new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
you told him to play the boxer gay!!
you totally screwed him over.
varrrrrroom! hey! watch it lady! varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) varrrrrrrrroom. (notices rachel and stops) all right, I will leave. my bed’s so boring.
(on phone) hey, it is me. i know you can not stand to be in the same room as me, so i just thought I would try and apologize over the phone. all i… (joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
look i never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I am… (joey hangs up the phone again.)
(entering) aww, turkey! aww, giving thanks! aww!
they could not be worse. i spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
hey, by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa, ‘because i want to trade for her.
wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
oh that is not true! that is not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on monica and phoebe’s faces.) oh, there was no big dog. all right this sucks! i already got her this briefcase, and i had r.g. put on it… (phoebe looks confused.) her initials…
op, y'know what though, it is kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start!
thanks.
monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
well maybe you should put some ice on it.
he is really picky about his patients.
(entering) all right! okay! i think i am making some progress with joey, when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (ross is pleased.) i mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
oh y’know what, i was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
i do not know r.g., i was thinking something girlie for your office.
oh no-no-no, you do not want to do that, then you are going to get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
like?
when was the last time you saw her wear it?
big dog?
i walk into a room and he will not even talk to me, he just mumbles something in italian. and i know he only knows the bad words.
hey joe.
hey! I am sorry! that—(sees that joey is about to leave) where are you going?
oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
what?!
hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say that I will stop seeing her?
hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up!
all right look, if you are not going to stay for me, then at least stay for them! okay, they have had a very difficult year! what with the robbery and all!
what?
all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that i can do! something! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down. (joey looks intrigued) what?
(he is now in the box, in their living room.) sounds like a really bad idea to me.
the meaning of the box is three fold. one (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what i did. two (holds up another finger), it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey. and three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!
air hole! air hole!! (ross retracts his hand quickly.)
how do ya do.
what happened? what happened?!
gotcha! (laughs)
sorry!
okay, okay, you got it!
you can not tell, but I am trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
you are right, and I am sorry! this means a lot to me! i want you to be my friend again! i swear, i will not say another word tonight.
absolutely!
so?
yeah?
man, this is…
