so, we realize that—oh no… (she resets herself) I am telling it! I am telling it… (she loses it.)
‘xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay—[beep]—uck it!
oh-ooh, and i brought operation, but umm i lost the umm… (it starts buzzing) it is making a noise.
ooh, soap opera digest!
well at monica’s you can eat—(suddenly cracks up.)
what do i smell?
what do i smell?
what do i smell?
what do i smell?
(spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) oh, sweet je—(beep)—sus! oh! monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!
thank you my babies. (waves good-bye.)
oh my god, they took my idea!
yeah! okay, here you go. (rolls her back to rachel)
oh my god, are you guys okay?
umm, oh, about three months.
whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. they require constant care. they-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.
(to pete) wow! that is exciting, you went to japan, made up a woman.
I am just saying, this woman, i mean she is fictitious. no?
‘because you are still into monica. so you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘because you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
yeah, no, I am fairly intuitive and psychic. it is a substantial gift.
absolutely, oh i promise. tell her what?
no I am serious. i mean I am intuitive, but my memory sucks.
hey!
what?
ohh, monica, i am so excited for you.
ooh, i have to tell you something.
but i can not tell you.
well, sure in a perfect world. but, no, i promised i would not tell, and i swore to like all my gods.
no.
no.
no, but let us come back to that later!
noo!
oh, wait, wait. clogs, or claws?
no.
no.
(shaking her head yes) no!
i do not know! (frantically points at monica)
i can not!!
i, but you are so close! no!
oh, just go. you are never going to get it!
how can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
ohh! okay! okay, because when-when he said, "i can not wait to hear your first words," i thought, "there is a trick."
okay.
hey ross! does not ben go to the smithfield day school?
sting has a son that goes there too!
you knew this and you never said anything?! with all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
sting’s son, seven years old and there is a picture.
no, it is new york magazine. it is an article about the best schools in the city. so how well do you know sting?
uh-huh, yeah that is too bad. i really want to go to his concert friday night, but it is totally sold out. i know! why do not you meet him and get tickets?! if you get two I will take you.
there you go! oh, you are so lucky! you might actually get to meet sting tomorrow! that is why you have kids!
wow! they are beautiful!
what?!
well then get your money back and return them!
oh no! why not?
how come?!
wait! but ross if they do not get along then you should smooth things over. make them be friends.
sure you can! give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
your kid is seven?! (ross nods, "yes.") (to the rest) he is really small. (to ross) please! please get the tickets!
yes you can! sting says so himself!
(singing) rosssss can!
(singing) rossss can!
(singing) rosss can! give me the tickets! ross can give me the tickets!!
oh, there you are ben!
well, i heard you are having a problem with one of the boys in your class. and so i thought i would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. now umm, the boy’s name is sting’s son.
now ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
him you are friends with. (starts looking at the children trying to find jack and a teacher notices her.)
yes! yes you can, I am looking for jack’s parents.
uh-huh, I am with ben.
i am one of ben’s mothers. I am a lesbian. it was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
oh.
ah! okay so that would make me susan.
yeah! let us do that!! that-that sounds good. we should sit down and talk, just me, my lover carol, and the stings. umm, how-how will i get in touch with them?
uh-huh. uh-huh. umm, could-could i get a copy of that? ‘because carol threw it out, she lost ours. she is such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
wow! this place is incredible! (gasps) sting’s pen…that he gave to phoebe. (puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase) come on! secret passageway! (starts pulling books at random as trudie enters.)
hi!
uh-huh.
why else would i be here?
uh-huh. (they go and sit down.)
yeah.
umm, I am sorry. will not-will not jack’s father be joining us?
uh-hmm. okay. well then, could we reschedule? for say, friday night perhaps at 8 of the clock?
concert. yeah. that does put us in…quite a pickle. because you see I am very busy before and after the concert, and he is obviously busy during.
unless! unless umm, okay i-i would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
oh, thank you. four would be great.
oh good! then you are in luck! ben’s not my son!
the police? here? a reunion?! (she gets out her camera.)
oh my god! i do love you! how did you do it?!
oo, where are the seats?
okay, now would you say that that is more than 50 yards away from sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
then that is not breaking the law! I am there!
so what do you guys want for an engagement present?
not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that i would never let out of our family?
break my heart—oh, all right.
if you do not sail your boat, what do you do on it?
your own boat?
i just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
(pauses as he figures out how to answer that) because I am normal! that was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and i know you wanted it as an engagement present.
okay, here i wish you health and happiness. (she hands monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left.
why not?
really?!
you do?
that and arrogance.
i can not believe that! now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (she picks it up with her finger and holds it out to monica.) i wish you a long and happy marriage.
come on, it is not that big a deal!
oh, what was that for? like a bake sale?
yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
are there anymore from the good batch? ‘because we could just work off of those.
y’know, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we are trying to figure out her recipe. i bet she is l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.
oh yeah—no, she was really nice to me, but she is in hell for sure.
oh no-no, no, i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body. and that is not happening ‘til october 15th, 2032.
that is what you think.
well, y’know i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse.
nesele toulouse.
oh, you americans always butcher the french language.
(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) yes!! (realizes.) ohh.
i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why (looking down) you are burning in hell!!
yeah! have a great honeymoon!
it was his sweater, but—oh my god!
me too! (joins the hug.)
yeah, bye.
oh, it is so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
all in good time my love. all in good time. oh shoot! i left my guitar in their apartment. well you can let me in later.
what?! they took mine to give to you!
maybe they do not trust us.
you mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with monica’s guest towels?
no you did not.
well, what am i going to do? i really need my guitar!
what stuff?
did rachel find you?
oh she was looking for you.
well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
what?
(deadpan) and?
oh sorry. (shocked) and?!
(to joey) maybe it is something you ate?
of course i do! and I am going to give it back to you as soon as they are done with it at the key shining place.
well why do not you use your key?
oh! we could have done that.
oh great! and listen, could you do us a favor and not tell chandler and monica about this? ‘because y’know umm, they do not-they do not have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
oh no.
did not you two already talk?
(simultaneously) holy mother of god!!!
that is brand new information!!
a little bit.
oh ross.
oh hey hi, he is doing it. he is breaking down the door. (the chair breaks in half.) okay, we are in. (she hangs up the phone.)
hey! so how was the doctor?
good.
oh.
(entering carrying a skull) hey!
haaaa... (puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
huh?
oh, yeah, it is my mom's.
no, no, no. it is not! it is not my mom. it belonged to mom. yeah, no, she used to put it out every christmas to remind us, that even though it is christmas, people still die. and, you can put candy in it. (she grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.)
and maybe i could teach ben about the christmas skull and how people die.
(entering) oh, hey, you guys!
hey. guess what! my landlord just called and my apartment is going to get ready soon, so i guess I will be moving out.
yes, you will be very sad. all right, well i got to go tell rachel the good news.
yeah, why not?
why do you think, she is having so much fun living with joey?
really? so she said, she did not want to live with me anymore?
you are sure? you are absolutely sure?
probably? yeah, i do not like that word. (chandler and monica look surprised) kind of what ‘probably’ really means. yeah, uh-huh. yeah, oh, "your mom probably will not kill herself," y’know? I am sorry, but I am not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on-on "probably!" y’know? you got to take care of yourselves! (she starts to walk out) in this world history teaches us nothing! (exits)
so you like the drums! that is, that is great! y’know, i was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. all right, okay, well, apparently not! so, yay!
that is fun. (she exits disappointedly.)
hey!
hey! (she sits down next to him)
yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
maybe on some level.
(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) hey, joey, i got you another present. (she puts it on the counter)
it is a…tarantula! (joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) oh! god! rachel, look, I am sorry. what was i thinking giving joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
(sarcastic) ah, yeah, he is so adorable, god, he is just so much fun, joey is the best, I am glad you are having so much fun here. (she turns around, about to leave)
our apartment is ready.
because you would rather live here with joey.
monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here. and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is going to change that.
hm?
(nods along) fish!
yes, but i wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you are having so much fun over here…
we did have fun, did not we?
oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
yay, okay!
great, all right, okay, and monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
oh, this is terrible. oh, they have made so many changes i can not even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—ooh! new sconces!
what?
yeah?
yeah?
oh no! (she runs to see.) (running back, excitedly) oh! wow!!!
well, i guess we will just have to put the wall back up.
there is a skylight?! (runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) wow!!
(returning slowly) y’know I am-I am sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
a little bit, yeah.
you heard her too?! you have the gift!
are you sure?
oh me too.
no, i do not hear that.
oh.
oh.
okay, i understand why superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the easter bunny’s funeral?
what is your news?
(inquisitive) gosh, what is the pay like? (everybody stares at her indignantly) oh, come on people… (defending) come on, now, if i do not know who makes the most, how do i know who i like the most! (she looks at joey) hey joey! (joey winks at her)
(enthusiastic) that is great.
hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight?
oh, i hear divorce bells.
no.
lowell, is that you?
(simultaneously) oh my god!
(excited) I am sorry, ross, this is my old friend lowell from the streets. lowell, ross.
ah, it is been so long, so long. (they hug again) i can not believe you are still doing this!
good for you!
ouh… (she nods)
excuse me, ross, old friends catching up…
I am sorry i have friends outside the six of us.
well, I am not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i…
well, ok, i was not rich like you guys, ok, i did not eat gold and have a flying pony… i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…
she was a drug dealer!
(laughing) okay…
why?
(worried) you were?
(shocked) oh my god…
no… actually, you might want to stay away from jane street… that is where stabby joe works.
okay, i think we have a problem here.
well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marc's comics.
well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
i know… i mugged ross!
(spotting ross) hey, you!
hey, how was class?
nothing, i really want to know.
(interrupting) alright, nothing is worth this. uhm, i have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…
you do not have to lie anymore, ross, i know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
yes, it was.
(interrupting, pinching his year) "give me your money, punk!"
(apologetic) yeah, and I am so, so sorry, ross, I am sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it is kind of neat. (she smiles at him, but he does not understand) i mean, well, it is just that i I have always felt kind of like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and i have… have a great one!
i know, I am sorry, please forgive me. i do not know what to say…
really? even more humiliating than…
hey, ross! (he lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) i know you are still mad at me, but can i just talk to you for a second?
i just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something i think you will find very exciting.
look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell… or smoke. (ross looks at her in astonishment) anyway, i was looking through it and i found "science boy" (she holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to ross)
i can not say, i just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.
yeah… but you should know, i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
you are welcome. and thank you for "science boy". i learned a lot from him
it is so obvious, why does not he just ask?
you too!
ooh! that is a good one! mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane.
really?! how come?
do you want me to teach you? I am a great teacher.
well, i taught me and i love me.
hey!
hornswoggle? (to chandler) ooh, this must be killing you.
okay. (joey tries to take the guitar.) oh no-no-no, you do not touch the guitar! first you learn here, (points to her head.) then you learn here. (points to the guitar.)
okay, lesson one: chords. now, i do not know the actual names of the chords but umm, i-i-i made up names for the way my hand looks while I am doing them. (she starts to show joey the chords. transcribers note: for this one you will have to use your imagination, because it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. so if you want to see them, you will have to wait for this episode to come to a tv near you.) (holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) so then, this is bear claw. okay, umm, turkey leg and old lady. (joey tries to imitate them.)
hey everybody, rachel was so good today. she did not gossip at all.
ooh, you nailed the old lady! (they both laugh at what she said.)
did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? did you?!
give me your hands. (he does and she smells his left hand.) strings. give me it! (he gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) pick. do you want to learn to play guitar?
then do not touch one!!
tiger! (joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he does it with each name.) dragon! iceberg!! (he fails.) joseph, did you even study at all last night?
then do iceberg!
g-sharp? have you been studying the real names of the chords? (joey does not answer.) have you? (he looks away in shame.) oh my god!
no, but you are questioning my method!
y'know none of my other student thought i was stupid.
yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
fine! you go learn from your qualified instructor! but do not come crying to me when everyone is sick and tired of hearing you play bad, bad leroy brown!!
oh, fine! take his side! (storms out.)
no, i can not talk to you! i do not have a fancy ad in the yellow pages!
uh-huh!
no!
yeah!
okay, I am going to go too. I am going to go to the airport. i figure if i hang around there long enough, someone is bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
bye! (she exits, leaving rachel and joey alone.)
hey! it is raining. i do not want to fly in the rain. so…
that is weird. (pause.) i bet they are doing it.
hey!
oh, the olympics.
i still cannot believe you are engaged! (ross looks at her) just ‘because its happening so fast; not ‘because you are such a loser.
already?!
yeah, but y’know, about have of these are going to end up getting divorced.
you are the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.
no-no, let me in!
yeah!
no, you have to let me in right now!!
yes!
yeah.
(catching it) i got it! mine! (they both hug)
thank you!
okay! (gets into position) okay, ready?
okay. (phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
I am not going to right to you! that is not real!
yeah, i think we are.
well, at least you did not rent yours from a store called, "it is not too late."
me too.
me too.
okay.
yay!
i hate my regular clothes now! y’know? i look down and-and i know that this is not going to be the most special day of my life.
i guess.
oh my god!
oh, you are such a cheater!
hey!
oh, how did that happen?
what is that?
oh, how did it go?
what did he say?
yeah, maybe.
any luck?
(looks at monica) hey, y’know what might cheer you up?
no, yeah! the groom cannot see the bride!
not after this!
ehh?
i-i mean i, well i think i can figure it out. i guess y'know i was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
how close?
i do not even know how that would work!
(interrupting) I am not asking!
yeah. let us see, my had mom killed herself, and my dad had run off, and i was living in a gremlin with a guy named cindy who talked to his hand.
yeah, well, everybody does! I am a really cool person. and y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you did not even try! y'know what, you walked out on me, and I am just, I am going to do the same thing to you.
i do not ever want to see you again!
(walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) umm, where is my purse?
well, umm, my mom’s friend, phoebe, is actually my birth mom.
oh, my new mom, who-who is a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)
no. I am just, i want to, i need to be alone.
(turning around, insistently) monica!
well, I am ready to get the hell out of here! (sees ross and rachel cuddling on the couch.) oh. are you? are you?!! (they nod ‘yes.’) ohh! that is so great!! ooh, not for bonnie. (they nod ‘no.’) but for you, yay! ohh.
okay, I am going to put this (her suitcase) in the car.
(to the person that answered the door) hi, ursula.
okay, well umm, i know that we have not talked in a long time, but umm okay, our mom is not our birth mom. this-this other lady is our birth mom.
(shocked) you know her?!
there-there was a suicide note?! (ursula nods ‘yes.’) well, do you still have it?
i can not believe you did not tell me there was a suicide note!
i, umm, shut up!
(reading from the note) “good-bye phoebe and ursula. I will miss you. p.s. your mom lives in montauk.” you just wrote this!
noooo!!
no. I am-I am to depressed to talk.
(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) thank you, thank you. ohh, and i invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (sees that phoebe sr. has entered, and to her) except for you. you go away.
okay, bye.
no.
but, it is not like we are losing anything. y'know?
it is not like we-we know each other or anything. or that have anything in common.
i-i like pizza!
oh my god, so do i!
wait-wait-wait, wait! puppies. cute or ugly?
uh-huh, well! but umm, still I am-I am mad at you.
well umm, do you want to get something to eat? I am kind of hungry.
all right, stop it. now you are just doing it to freak me out.
what am i sitting on?
(taking something out of the couch) ew-eww!! undies!
umm, wethering heights. I am taking a literature class at the new school and i have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
yeah! well, i really liked that lamaze class i took! y'know and this time i thought I would go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
yeah! ooh, you should come with me! oh yeah, then I would have someone to sit with!
yeah! okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
this is going to be so much fun! okay-shhh, i have to finish.
okay, look you want to hold onto your food? you got to scare people off. i learned that living on the street.
okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (writes him a note and the gang reads it.)
someday I will, tell you about the time i stabbed the cop.
well, he stabbed me first!!
okay.
i thought you said you read it in high school.
okay, umm, it is this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england. which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff's character. i totally get symbolism.
(to rachel) you completely stole my answer!
well how would you know?! you did not even read it!
i think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
would you care to venture one?
are you just repeating what I am saying?
okay then.
yeah but why did not you just say that you did not read the book?!
yeah?
hi!
you did not read this one either?!
what?
no! you should have read it yourself!
fine! okay, all right, so jane eyre, first of all, you would think she is a woman, but she is not. she is a cyborg.
yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
umm, rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
(smiling) I am sorry. it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop.
well, i snapped! okay? you were not taking the class seriously.
well, yeah! fun is good, but y'know i also wanted to learn. y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school.
all right, wait! just wait. everybody just calm down. okay? let us give our friend joey a chance to explain why he is such a big pervert!
what is going on?
so that is why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
i really thought you making a good point. i mean y'know, until you got cut off.
i do not know! i did not come with her!
well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
y’know, this is probably none of my business, but were not you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
oh, sly.
(interrupting) okay, i got a good one. okay, umm, what is she? like 12?
(entering) hey!
okay, i just thought of the perfect guy for rachel to take to her thing.
oh that is good, i guess she will have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
‘because that is just your taste.
oh yeah?
my guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. and, he has one of these (she squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)
a chin dimple!
have you seen your guy’s body?
well my guy is spectacular. okay? he is a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, i looked at it. and i mean all of it.
oh yeah, like there are police for that!
i know. (laughs.)
oh, chandler funny?
my guy is well read.
my guy has great teeth!
hey!
what did you do on yours?
rachel, what the hell is this?!
you ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
yeah and i-i found you one too who is not a weirdo.
so, sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
no reason, it is just i know a single guy that cares about other people.
well, so do a lot of people.
yeah, y’know what i noticed rachel? he scares easy. is that the kind of guy you would like to take to a ball? "hey sebastian, would you like to dance?" (imitates him.) "uhh, okay—i got to go!"
yeah! what have you got to lose? y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
okay sure!
ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
okay.
ross, you can not tell her not to go. you just started dating.
nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
this is patrick. (points to him.)
(looks) oh my god, you are right! i am too late; they are sitting on the couch and talking! (to patrick) come on! (they go over to the couch.) rachel?
this is patrick.
yeah, this is the guy i was telling you about.
yeah. and believe me, this suit does not do justice to what is underneath it.
yeah?
oh! okay! yeah, that is okay. (to patrick) have a seat. (sits patrick down next to rachel.)
rachel? patrick is really rich. (to patrick) give her some money.
yeah, okay, let us talk it out.
then why did she ask us to…
rachel, we are sorry for pushing those guys on you.
oh my god, look! that is elizabeth!
did i miss it, did i miss it?
i just thought we might be here for awhile. you know, things might get musical.
(singing)
thanks, ross.
ok.
oh, look, twins. hi, guys. oh, cute, cute.
hey. ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
hey, hey, ok, all right, that is it! get in here. come on. my god, you guys, i do not believe you. there are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. so just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
do not make me do this again, i do not like my voice like this.
ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
(singing) they found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...(sees ross and susan staring at her) la la la la la la.
this is so great.
i mean, well, because when i was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. and here is this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they are fighting over who gets to love it the most. and it is not even born yet. it is just, it is just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I am sorry, you were fighting.
(reading the nametag on the uniform) hi, I am ben. I am hospital worker ben. it is ben... to the rescue!
well, susan, i see what appears to be a dark vent. wait. yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
(from the air vent overhead) you guys, he is beautiful!
susan, he looks just like you.
oh, look, look, he is closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) look, he is opening his eyes. (picture comes back)
oh, look, he is closing his eyes again.
(returning with joey) with what?
oo! you should have one of us do it!
no! no! it is-it is uh a real thing! anyone can get ordained on the internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
yes! a friend of mine did it and it is totally legal!
what?! no! it was my idea!
oh, i have a headache. a horrible headache!
oh my god, you have got to stop chattering!
what is it?
oh no, i do not believe in western medicine. no, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (she is pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (takes the pills.)
oh.
it is amazing! my headache is completely gone! what are those pills called?
oh, i love you hexadrin! (she kisses the box.) oh look! it comes with a story! (she pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
say what?
oh my god! (starts reading them.) dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—headache. vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! now okay, i do not recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! oh I am sorry, extra strength death capsules!
why?
i have liver damage. ow! oh! (she grabs the left side of her torso.)
okay, then i must be disoriented.
i feel like my face is swelling. (to monica) is my face swelling?
oh, interesting you should call me that! now that i may never have one! (holds up the warning label.)
did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
oh! suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
yeah, it is totally meant to be. (to monica) tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
(to joey) what?!
i know! robin is so gay!
I am really glad you guys are okay but, i just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (points to monica and joey) actually had hooked up.
(still reading the label) oh my god! this is a six-hour pill! (checks her watch) that is it! I am out of the woods! ohh! what a relief!
oh, it is like huge weight has been lifted! ‘because look, (reads the side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I am just so happy! because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—oh.
oh! hey, rach!
oh, you, too.
okay.
(sighs) honey, i wish you would get over her. i hate seeing you like this. is there anything i can do for you? do you want to look down my top?
oh, gunther, can i get a scone?
so, how does mona feel about you and rachel living together?
ugh. come on, mona, do not kiss ass.
all right. oh! shoot! oh shoot! uh, rachel wanted to see this tape!
it is a video of my friend giving birth. could you just bring it back to your apartment?
yeah. candy’s the mother, cookie’s the daughter. the father’s also cookie. why am i friends with these people?
oh, monica, grow up!
(knocking and entering) hey. look, i know you have been really depressed lately, so i brought someone over to cheer you up. right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
he-hee!
this is the happiest dog in the world. i borrowed him from my friend wendy. now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. and he will cheer you up!
how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you?
taffy, really? I have never had any.
well, i think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (ross hands her one) thank you! so what, you are just never going to tell her?
if i have not said it before: she is a lucky, lucky lady! so, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (referring to the taffy, which she is been chewing this whole time.) oh, god. is it gum, is it food? what is the deal? (she swallows it, finally) oh, it is nice! may i try a pink one?
(entering) hey!
hey, buddy. how is my favorite dog, huh? how is my favorite dog? (the dog does not move) you are subdued. (to joey) did you give him a beer?
will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
he is miserable! what happened to him?
what stuff?
oh…joey, you bummed him out! this was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
okay, I am going to take him back to wendy’s.
(turns around) um, that is it. no. hey! you! j. crew guy. yeah. why have you been following me? i mean, all week long everywhere i look there is you.
what?
oooh. oh, well this is awkward.
um, yeah, you want ursula, and I am phoebe. twin sisters! seriously.
oh, you are not a dingus.
well, i mean look it is, it is not your fault, you know. i mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
wait, (grabs him) you know what, i got a little story. when i was in junior high school i went through this period where i thought i was a witch. and there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that i think will help you a lot. he said okay, 'you are not a witch you are just an average student.' see what I am saying?
um, well, get over it. so, i mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. do not be so hard on yourself okay.
oh, thanks a lot. do you want to get a cup of coffee?
okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) okay, you do not have to walk behind me any more.
(entering) hi!
hey, oh, you know that guy who is been following me? i talked to him today.
okay, first I am not crazy. and second, say it do not spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he was not following me, i mean he was, but because he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that is why, that is why he could not just come up and talk to me. because of the restraining order.
ooh! no, no, no, no, he is not like a kook, no. he is just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. and we just get along really well, and he is so cute.
no, I am just going to help him, you know, get 'de-ursula-ized', like you know, like i did for joey after he went out with her.
okay, i asked for the news, not the weather.
oh, great. great. you are doing great, you know real strong. going strong. keep going.
oh, yeah. what is this? (picks up a book)
um, not even a little bit.
oh, okay then.
good. so what were you thinking?
really?
oh.
oh, okay. (he kisses her)
(entering) hellooo!
oh, well he is yummy. we did a little kissin'.
oh, no, no, no, no. you know what, he is not into that stuff anymore. he quit for me.
look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
what, he is not still following her. do you think he is still following her?
what are you saying i should do?
thank you, monica.
yes? yes! oh.
oh, i was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. oh, here it is! oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)
um, perhaps. yes! yes, I am sorry, I am sorry. i was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. just walkin' along looking like me. what, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
no, no, it is not your fault. you know it is partly my fault, because i made you quit cold turkey. sorry, no. okay, well, i mean, i can not date you anymore, because your, you know (in a high pitched voice) wow! but um, but i will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. okay, stalk me for a while. huh? yeah, and, and, and, I will be like an ursula patch.
yeah, just, okay, look I am going. um, come on. op, op, behind the pillar, which way am i going to go?
hey guys!
hey, have you seen frank jr., because he is meeting me here with the triplets.
hey, what is all this stuff?
ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
oh, how does it work?
well, if you are having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, bill and colleen. they adopted a kid. I am sure they would help you.
hey!
good to see you.
oh, god. so adorable. look at them sleeping there like angels.
well, they may be a handful, but they are so cute.
oh, god, the last time i babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
that is a, that is a long time.
yeah, i know, frank. i counted them when they were coming out of my area.
what?
oh my god, frank, are you thinking of leaving? because i did not have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
what?! you can not separate them! that is terrible. which one?
okay, well, this is crazy. can not seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
insane.
alice would never go for it, right?
well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. which one would you be willing to give up?
frank jr.jr.?
uh-huh.
well, alright, that is fine. what about leslie?
alright, so that leaves chandler.
wow, frank. i think we just ran out of kids.
I am sorry, frank. i did not realise things were so bad. you know, I will help out more. i can - i can babysit any time you want. you name the day, and I will be there.
well, that is not good. but you know, i can move some stuff around, and I will be there. you and alice just take the whole day together.
are you kidding? that is what sisters are for.
hey.
still, he had to find out sometime.
hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
uh-huh, what?
oh!
well, that would be great but then what do we do about denise?
my roommate.
yes, denise. denise!
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say. i talk about her all the time! denise!!!!!
hey.
so, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
you did not tell her did you?
of course not, because you are in love with her.
what do you mean, comforted her?
ah-ha! a classic sign of love, the hug!
yeah, not in your case lovey loverson. (tries to take a bite out of ross’s cookie.)
okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! that is why, that is why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them! (ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) oh come on ross, you are a scientist.
(taking his coffee) okay, whatever you say. but just be careful, all right? rachel’s not in the same place you are.
okay, i did not understand that, but y’know, maybe that is ‘because you were speaking the secret language of love!
shhhhhh! I am swamped right now.
umm, I am trying to move that pencil. (there is a pencil lying on the table.)
it worked!
wait, no, look at this! (points to one.) (reading) "two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay…" oh, yeah, but it is on the ground floor.
i saw it.
umm, I am talking about that which you already know but will not admit. you love her again; you re-love her!
i can not believe you will not just admit it! (pause) okay, just promise me that you will not do anything stupid.
what?!
wow! I am-I am so happy for you guys. (to ross) this is so-so, not stupid.
no. no, i will not. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he did not love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and that is how she ended up living with me! (ross looks at her.) (pause) okay, that is a lie.
(singing) i found you in my bed!
now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so i can buy a computer.
(on the microphone, accidentally) yes.
hey!
about twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
well i do not, i do not have a mother so often i forget that other people…
no. (pause) neither is mine.
i know. i know, what is her number?
is not it at three?
oh, i told the stripper to be here at five. that is good right?
what? he is going to be dressed as a baby! (mrs. green enters.) oh hi mrs. green!
I am so glad you could make it.
yeah i know. is not it great? one less person we have to make small talk with.
no look, we have apologized twice! i can not do anymore than that. i know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
for how long?
she can not hear you.
well, if you do not want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
i have new respect for chandler. all right everybody! it is time to open the presents!
how about you less important people, let us open your presents!
okay, come on rach it is present time! y’know you are the glue that is holding this whole party together. it is kind of falling apart here.
okay, this is from your friend at work.
hey! why are you all red and sweaty?
not if you were here.
no, not a thing.
nothing! you have apologized to her like a million times and she is been nothing but terrible to you. and do not forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she has not even thanked you for it.
yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her, I would tell her off.
uh-huh!
(to monica) wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…
you were fantastic! I am so proud of you!
you should be!
you got it!
(clears throat) rach, so, that guy there. straight or gay?
yeah? why?
oh no not that guy there. that guy right there. (pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
(a woman with large breasts walks in the door) ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (she walks by and he checks her out.)
ohh, he left his cell phone.
or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing.
yeah… that does sound great. I am going to get the phone. (they both get up.)
i do not know. i have not been out on a date in so long.
that was not a date! that was, that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having sex.
no way! no way! you just broke with tag a week ago.
nice try.
i do not know.
ah-ha! too cocky!
or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
(handing rachel the phone) fine all right, but I would bet you would be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
ohh, i lost my mom to suicide.
did i use that already today? I am sorry.
okay, a meat eater. fine, that is one for you.
so you do not know that is barney’s the store! that can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. who has barney’s the store on their speed dial?
hi!
good.
yeah.
yeah!
ooh, now you lost me.
no i did not!
no.
that is a different phone.
that is damning evidence.
(on phone) hello? (listens) yes, I am the one who found your phone.
(to rachel) shhh! I am on a call! (on phone) umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? at-at my apartment. it is umm, it is umm 5 morton street, apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (listens) okay, well okay I will see you then. (listens) bye. (hangs up.)
oh? and how will you know what time to come over?
oh. okay, well i-i was kind of hoping that i would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
what?! that is the first time today!
whoa! why do you get to answer the door?
because it is my apartment!
okay. all right. (hands her the phone.) good luck explaining all the calls to china.
(to rachel) wow! how long were we arguing for?
could you-could you umm, give us one second?
wh-what do we do?
can you believe this? (rachel exhales in amazement.) we were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
hmm, they just do not make ‘them like that anymore!
rachel, listen—i mean, if you let me have him then i will really owe you one.
yeah! you are such a great friend!
oh that would be me. sir. (hands him the cell phone.) after you.
(whispering) nice!
eeee!!! eee!! eee!!
(reading): dear ms. green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... (crumples up letter)
wow!
(reading): your visa bill is huge!
what?
yeah, what is that? like, some kind of guy thing? like, some kind of sexist guy thing? like it is poker, so only guys can play?
oh, ok, so then what is it? some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
congratulations!
ok, i just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
but... I am ready, so, just deal.
(to joey): oh i see, so then, you were lying.
about how good your cards were.
a-ha! and... what is bluffing? is it not another word for... lying?
ok, monica? i had another answer all ready.
ha. ha, ha.
oh, hello, kettle? this is monica. you are black.
oh, it is like the mother ship is calling you home.
thank y... (thinks about it)
ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
alright, here is my $7.50. (hands them the money) but i think you should know that this money is cursed.
oh, i cursed it. so now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
(holding a card and waving it in front of her face) hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever i go. (they look at her) right, ok, serious poker.
(looks at her cards) yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?
yeah. um... I am out. (throws in cards)
monica, in or out?
ok joey, your bet.
ross?
chandler?
me too. rachel.
plus that shirt does not really match those pants.
y'know, there is going to be lots of other stuff.
I am in.
...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
that is a bird?
that is a bird!
hey, everybody. happy thanksgiving!
hey, what is going on joe?
oh okay. how about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing. you know? you. you could. you could see the strings people!
ooh, honey. you stink at lying.
oh really. okay. let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffee house, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
do not worry, do not worry. we will come up with a good lie. I will help you practice it.
sure, what.. what was the work thing?
"pick up grandma at the airport"?
oh right, ok um. ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . for example if you look down at the ground when you are talking, people know you are lying.
that is a great movie. <she claps>
phoe-be.
there is your movie! <claps>
it is ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it is easy to remember and does not invite a lot of questions. you were not at the parade because you had a family emergency.
ooh, what happened?
no! nothing with a raccoon.
yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
oh my god! should not we stop this?
it is all right. you can mourn.
hey, does monica know about her broken plates yet?
broke them all, huh?
you going to tell her?
no problem! next week: stealing... (chandler walks away to store the box of broken china.)
hey!
wow, that sounds great! and what are you making monica, in case rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that i eat all of it. there is none left for anybody else!
and who else is going to be there?
yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very thanksgivingy.
rach, rach, i just remembered. i had a dream about mr. geller last night.
yeah, i dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! and it is making me look at him totally differently. y’know, i mean he used to be just, y’know “jack geller monica and ross’s dad” and now he is he is “jack geller, dream hunk."
rachel?
okay, look at him. look at those strong hands. oh what i would not give to be that can of (looks closer to see what jack is drinking) condensed milk.
monica, leave him alone!
so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, is not it?
wow. so then did you make it with beef or eggplant?
i can not have any. you know i do not eat meat. (faking dissapointment.) ohhh no.
rachel, come here. (rachel walks over to phoebe. chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack.
i dunno, let us see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were going to get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl.
yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not going to happen.
five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman.
(joining in) i love jacques cousteau!
oh, ross, mon, is it okay if i bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?
well, his name is parker and i met him at the drycleaners.
yeah, he is really great though. he has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl i am.
hey!
everybody, this is parker, parker this is…
hey!
I will go with you
were you guys making fun of parker?
so, he a little enthusiastic, what is wrong with that?
well, so what i like him! do i make fun of the people you have dated? tag, janice, mona? no, because friends do not do that. but, do you want my opinion? do you want it? ‘because in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who is who of human crap. (walks off)
no, I am fine. I am great. I am with you.
hm huh, yeah.
no, that is not necessary.
no, actually i do not eat…
okay, fine! fine! (takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) mmm…hmmmmm….
why do not you just try one?
then you better do it now.
because I am going to kill him
you guys were right. he is just too excited about…everything. i mean I am all for living life, but this is the geller’s 35th anniversary. okay? let us call a spade a spade this party stinks.
are you sure it was not an oyster?
he is just such a great guy I am so excited about him.
you think?
you are right. you are right, he is just embracing life. we could all stand to be a little more like parker. you know what? i am like him! I am a sunny, positive person.
what is that now?
oh look it is parker!
oooh i love it!
are you kidding? people acting like animals to music. come on!
can i get you something to drink? like a water and valium?
oh thank god.
yeah? i know! i know! uh huh? listen why do not we just um, sit and relax? you know just be with each other. quietly!
let us try something else, let us play a game.
shocking! let us play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (giggles)
but, let us play this one first. and remember whoever talks first loses!
oh my god! oh my god!
wrong? really? you know the word wrong. everything is not perfect? everything is not magical? everything is not a glow with the light of a million fairies? they were just brake lights, parker!
you do not have to put a good spin on everything.
no! i am a positive person. you are like santa clause on prozac, at disneyland, getting laid!
much less happy!
so long! do not let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (he exits and she slams the door behind him.)
uh huh. (closes door)
his first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!
i never had a bike of my own.
well, we did not have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
no! but she gave me the box that it came in. it had a picture of the bike on the front. (they are all speechless) so i would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
not really, i got to drag him around too! (they all nod, "oh.")
yeah, and they have been coming by all day. they love it!
sure!
(gasps) oh my god ross!!
i love it!!
ohh!! ohh!! and i love you!
not that way! but the bike brought you a lot closer!
okay! oh my god! my first bike! thank you for the best present I have ever gotten.
(starts to leave, but stops) oh and chandler’s about to cry.
oh hi!
ohh, uh-huh so much!
of course!
okay. (the gang is giggles then phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) see?
(hopping off the bike) wait! this seat is really uncomfortable! yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
why? why do i have to learn?
what kind of an emergency?
okay, i would ring the bell to distract him and then i would knock the gun out of his hand with a chinese throwing star.
you will not let go?
swear?!
(thinks it over) okay.
all right.
well…
okay. (does so.)
okay.
weee!!! (ross pushes her and let us go.)
oh! oh! oh no!! you swore!
i am shocked! shocked!! (she storms off leaving ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
(seeing him) oh, hello liar.
i could have been killed i hope you know!
well, i would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
what?! (ross rings the bell.) what the hell?!
what?! why?!
all right. if you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
(sarcastically) okay ross! (ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) please do not die!
i can not believe it! i did it! i rode a bike! i never thought I would be able to do that! thank you ross.
do not be so corny ross, it is not an after-school special. (she rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)
okay!
and call me!
we want you to marry her!
she is so amazing! you have no idea.
joey, she is so cool. she speaks four languages.
yeah, but you always say that.
whatever.
secret affair!
(entering with erin) oh. hey!
oh no.
hey!
yay!! oh so, you are not, you are not mad at us anymore?
did not you sleep together?
then change it back!
no spark? did not you sleep together?
does joey have any idea?
yeah, you mean like that you are kind of a loner.
yeah, and maybe that you are a real (she says something in italian, and it does not matter what she said. it is not important so i do not need everyone who speaks italian telling me what she said.)
oh well, i guess italian is not one of the four languages you speak.
no, just a regular old flying dwarf.
hey!
so how was, how was your date?
oh really? she said she wants to go away with you?
hey joey, y’know what? you are way to good for her.
absolutely!
okay. (joey exits.)
oh, i have dinner plans with joey. we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
duly noted.
joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet?!!
well, I will tell you rachel karen green, i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note. (hands it to rachel.)
oh that is a nickname we were trying out.
oh! here is joseph francis!
so what?! that does not give you the right to ditch me!
i do not accept this rule. when me make plans, i expect you to show up. okay, i can not just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (motions that their friendship) is for life!
well, it does.
okay, you wore me down.
(gasps) (whispering) oh my god! that is david!
david the scientist guy, david that i was in love with, david who went to russia and broke my heart david!
oh, you say someone is name enough, they turn around.
david! (he kisses her cheek) what-what are you doing here? are not you supposed to be in russia?
well… yeah. you look great too. did you get a haircut?
yeah.
uh-huh.
well, of course i would want to see you. i…i think about you all the time.
really?
uh-huh.
yeah.
(excited) yes! oh no!
i can not. i can not believe i have plans, i can not. can you do it tomorrow night though?
uh-huh. (they go over and talk.)
well, i have plans with joey tonight.
no he will not. and that is not even the point! monica, i made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! and now y’know what? just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from russia just for one night, i-i should change my beliefs?! i should change beliefs! no! no! no, if i do not have my principles, i do not have anything!
or! i should rush through dinner with joey and i can meet david at 9:00!
hey!
yes! i will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.
okay.
oh joey, we have heard the specials three times! okay? there is prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (she grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)
huh?
(checking her watch) yeah, I am very wise. i know.
what?
god joey, this is taking forever!
w-w—i just—it is that—i have—y’know i have-i have an appointment. and it is very important.
well… it is a date.
come on joey, do not make me feel badly about this.
that—it is not the same thing! this is totally different! this is with david! remember david, the scientist guy? okay, he is very special to me.
she was?
okay, whatever. y’know what? i do not have time have time to convince you because he is only here for four hours, and I am going to go see him! (gets up and leaves.)
yeah!
yeah! (she exits.)
hey!
oh, i would not miss this.
oh, you are such a gentleman. (grabs his arm.) come on! we are going to my place! (drags him off to her place.)
are you sure? I will bet there is another flight to minsk in like…
that is really beautiful. what does it mean?
that is good. i got to admit, i thought it was something else.
you are right! you are right. do not say it.
i do too. (they kiss.)
(seeing him) okay, now’s not the time joey. all right? you can yell at me tomorrow.
no I am not okay. the only guy I have ever been crazy about has gone to minsk and i may never…i may never see him again. (crying.)
oh right, like they are going to let me have a passport.
well—but—now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (they hug again.)
ooh, I will go in on that with you! i could not think of anything.
hey! i brought you some house warming gifts.
yeah. salt, so your life always has flavor.
bread, so you never go hungry.
and a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
yeah!
mr. president.
yeah. i really like his glasses.
oh, hi ross!
oh, i thought this was your party and it turns out it is a party for howard. he is just the sweetest little man! (a guest walks up to her.)
yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
yeah, but they did not ask me! y'know? this way I am just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. that is always fun to be.
no I am not. no! if anything I am making you look better! they will see you talking to me and that is--I am a hit!
hey!
yeah, okay, my bad.
(ignoring him and continuing her conversation) that is what I am saying. (laughs.)
ooh. (turns to him.)
no! no! I am talking you up to people. just give it a little time, all right? relax, get something to eat! okay?
oh, i was telling them about you and emily. y'know, try to get some sympathy.
but somehow you came off as the bad guy.
yeah, i think i told it wrong. y'know, we should talk about that because i do not totally understand what happened there.
oh, okay, see? things are looking up already!
all right, everyone calm down! everyone calm down! i have something that i would like to say! who here likes ross? (ross is the only one who raises his hand and phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) of course you do not like him! he-he did not give you any money, he raised his own hand when i asked, "who hear likes ross," and he is wearing two nametags! (he takes one off.) i-I will be honest with you guys, when i first met ross i did not like him at all! but then once i got to know him i saw that he is really sweet and caring and very generous. i mean, all I am saying is do not judge ross before you get to know him all right? i mean, i like all you guys now, but when i first meet you y'know kurt, i thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm lola, mind numbingly stupid! and okay, you guys (she turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who are a couple.) (to the girl) gold-digger, (to the old guy) cradle robbing perv! so, i think you all know what i mean.
obviously i did not think they were going to start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
aw, and i was going to ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week.
(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) morning. rach, I am here with the purses!
your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
umm, no, it is a purse. and there is a thermos in it.
a stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. why do not you get a magician?!
well, can you dance at all?
(covering her mouth in shock) what, what is that?
oh, how was last night with julio, senorita?
oh yeah.
oh my god, oh my god! poor monica!
what?! he was with her when he wrote this poem. look, (reading) 'my vessel so empty with nothing inside. now that I have touched you, you seem emptier still.' he thinks monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
oh, totally. oh, god, oh, she seemed so happy too.
(entering) hey!
what are you wrapping?
yeah, it is a vase.
well not exactly like the one in the poem.
remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? oh. (hugs her)
oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he is at flimby’s.
oh, yeah, that is the word i use when i can not remember the real thing.
no! rachel, that is what they want me to do. my warranty expires tomorrow, if i do not get through, they are not going to fix my crappy, broken phone for free! we cannot let them win! it is us versus them!
like a date type (looks at rachel) person?
thanks!
okay. (on phone) ooh, I am setting the phone down. (does so) but I am still here! just do not go anywhere I am still here. (starts to put on the sweater) do not-do not switch or anything, ‘because I am, I am right here. (she has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) just one sec. one sec! one second!! (she is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as monica returns from the bathroom.) wait! one second! just…
what?! monica, I am scared!!
yeah.
yes!! yes!! I am the next caller! you were going to have me hang up.
no.
oh, is the play over?
nah. i kept myself busy.
oh, okay, yeah. (to monica) i put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
no, no, I am fine, and y’know why? ‘because of all the riboflavin.
I am so, so, so sorry, joey. i definitely am going to see you are play. i swear you are play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. you are play is the next play is the next play I am going to see.
oh, i… (starts jabbering incoherently)
i do, i believe you.
yeah. but i also believed her (points to the phone) when she said i was next.
yeah, i know. oh, good thing it is one of those 801 numbers. right?
no, no, no, oh no-no-no, it is has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘because all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. (finds the number) yeah, every big utah-based company has one.
sorry, I am so sorry, i will pay you back.
fine! fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) oh-oh!
well, i think i broke it. but that is all right, here is the number you can call.
ugh, pbs!
ugh, what is right with them?
okay, because right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. so, i just thought that it would make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street, because they were so nice when i was a little kid! no one ever wrote back.
all i got was a lousy key chain! and by that time i was living in a box. i did not have keys!
this is not a good deed, you just wanted to get on tv! this is totally selfish.
what-what are you talking about?!
yeah. so?
yes there are! there are totally good deeds that are selfless.
yeah, it is… y'know there is—no you may not!
are you calling me selfish?!
I am going to find a selfless good dead. I am going to beat you, you evil genius.
hey, joey, when you said the deal with santa clause, you meant?
right. (she turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
i cannot believe i can not find a selfless good deed! y'know that old guy that lives next to me? well, i snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. but he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. then i felt wonderful. that old jackass!
i will find a selfless good deed! because i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right!
ooh-ohh!
why?
yeah.
yeah, but you have known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
(on phone from central perk) hey joey, i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed. i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me.
well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. the bee is happy and i am definitely not.
(thinks for a moment.) aw, dammit! (slams the phone down.)
ooh, it is not a toy.
(on phone) hi joey.
i would like to make a pledge. i would like to donate $200.
oh, I am still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who is moms did not kill themselves, so by supporting them, I am doing a good thing, but I am not happy about it. so there, a selfless good deed.
no, it sucks. i was saving up to buy a hamster.
yeah, not the one i had my eye on.
oh, look-look, joey's on tv! is not that great? my pledge got joey on tv! oh that makes me feel—oh no! (realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it is selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
wow! could everyone totally see up his robe?
(singing) "little, tiny tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. swinging with the greatest of ease…" darn it! now, i do not know who to get to the next verse.
yeah, ooh, i like that! yeah. wait! how do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’
oh yeah, that is right, the keyboards, huh?
i want to hear "the sound."
come on, play that funky music white boy.
wow, it was so—wow!
what are you guys talking about, i loved it! it was soo moving. oh, plus it is just, it is so different from the stuff you usually hear.
(pushing monica back onto the couch) it is so inspired! look at him! look at him go!
oh no, I am not playing tonight.
i can not follow ross! it would be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed the beetles. no.
oh my god, he is not even appreciated in his own time. i would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
you guys. you suck too. (she hugs them both.)
hey! you were really great! you were really, really great!
well, kind of. yeah. yeah.
yeah, i-i can not—i mean y’know i was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, i just—i feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. i…
oh no. no-no-no, do not do that! how could i live with myself if i knew i was depriving the world of your music.
does joey know?
i think maybe, yeah.
yeah! no, that is right. and i thought it was a really good idea.
oh my god, he is lost it. he is totally lost it.
after that? yeah! no, i mean if i can help.
i like our way. oh! (grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of joey’s like in checkers.) chess!
yeah.
hey!
hey oh, rach wait! do you want to go to a movie tonight?
what is this? what is going on?
joey’s!
(laughs) yeah, I am sure that happened.
sure!
(to joey) which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
okay! i just—i did not know that you are a lesbian. (joey smiles and nods lewdly.)
okay, it just seems pretty wild and you are so—y’know so…vanilla.
yeah.
to ross.
okay! all right! yeah! ‘because i just can not picture it.
of course! yeah, i was uh, umm thigh mega tampon.
yeah! y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when regina philange died of alcohol poisoning.
really?!
oh, somewhere joey’s head is exploding.
rachel, it is okay. you do not have to do this. i believe you. all right? okay, if-if you say that you kissed melissa, then you kissed melissa.
i know.
i just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
I have had better.
what?!
yeah, except your breasts look kind of small. (points.)
oh! yeah! (monica glares at her.)
well maybe you do not talk about your feelings back then. maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he is taught you. like… (they all try to think about one example and do not succeed.) or all the things you taught him.
oh, look, twins. hi, guys. oh, cute, cute.
hey!
well let us just say its she is lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘because she is not so good at the writing.
well let us just hope it works. y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
yeah, you are right. how is the mrs.?
(looking out the window) oh, look! there is monica and chandler! (starts yelling.) hey! hey, you guys! hey! (chandler and monica start taking each other's clothes off.) ohh!! ohh! ahh-ahhh!!
(screaming) ahhh!! chandler and monica!! chandler and monica!!
chandler and monica!!!!
oh!! my eyes!!! my eyes!!!!
no! they are doing it!!!
you know?!!!
(screaming incoherently.) get in here!!! (motions to join her and rachel.)
okay, so now they know that you know and they do not know that rachel knows?
or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
bye chandler! (she walks up to him.) (quietly.) i miss you already. (she pinches his butt.)
I will have to get back to you on that. okay, bye! (hangs up.) oh my god! he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
no!
god, they thought they can mess with us! they are trying to mess with us?! they do not know that we know they know we know! (joey just shakes his head.) joey, you can not say anything!
he is not backing down. he went to get lotion.
joey! (examining the dress.) wow, you did not rip off any buttons.
umm, not without you, lover. (she slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) so, this is my bra.
you should be. I am very bendy. (pause) I am going to kiss you now.
ooh.
here it comes. our first kiss.
and why not?!
you are-you are what?!
i just—i thought you guys were doing it, i did not know you were in love!
y’know, you are friend’s getting married, it is got to change things.
how could it not be? i mean pretty soon they are going to be having kids, and then they are just going to be hanging out with other couples who have kids. and then maybe they are going to have to leave the city to be near a volvo dealership.
hey.
oh!
okay.
(to monica) oh, that is beautiful.
hey!
I have never driven it! okay? not once! okay once. okay, i drive it all the time.
okay, i can fix this! okay monica, rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (rachel glares at her.)
ooh, i think i want to trade circles.
okay, i think i need to do some shopping. (gets up and leaves.)
hey sweetie!
yeah! sure! ooh, i left my purse up at monica’s. I will be right back. (she goes to get it.)
what? (he leans in to kiss her.) oh. (they kiss and phoebe pauses.) ooh. (pause) whoa! that one kept going. (exits.)
hey!
yeah!
i know. they were mine.
no, it is not! we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on.
I am wearing his briefs right now.
i think so too. and that little flap? great for holding my lipstick.
and! y’know what jake says? that women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
there is nothing wrong with jake! okay? he is all man! I am thinking even more than you.
I am just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! i do not think you could ever do that.
okay whatever.
hey!
wow! nice! manly and also kind of a slut.
uh-huh.
huh.
that is great joe!
uh-huh.
hmm?
i think it is important that you do.
feel better?
yeah, i understand.
do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
just want to check my horoscope, see if it was right.
where? (turns to face him) ooh, come to momma.
we should do something. whistle.
come on, do it.
do it!
do it do it do it!
i can not believe you did that!
i just wish there was something we could do. (bends down and talks to him) hello. hello, coma guy. get up, you girl scout! up! up! up!
maybe nobody's tried this.
yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? that means he is artistic.
oh! and, he is the kind of guy who, when you are talking, he is listening, y'know, and not saying 'yeah, i understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
i know.
yeah, we-we feel kind of responsible.
hey hey hey! she is on!
your mom was arrested?
what about glen? he could be a glen.
ooh! how about agamemnon?
I am in.
hi.
nothing, i just thought I would stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that i.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
no. (monica brushes coma guy's hair in the other direction) no! no! ...so, um, do you think he is doing any better than he was this morning?
really? not even to, um, change his pajamas?! (whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)
(walks up with her guitar) hey rach.
hello.
going to the hospital tonight?
no, you?
okay, maybe it was a trick question. (plays a few chords) um, rachel can we do this now?
thanks. hi, um, 'kay. I would like to start with a song that is about a man that i recently met, who is, um, come to be very important to me. (monica gives her a look) 'kay. (sung:)
alright, whadyou do with him?
look at you! how, how do you feel?
I am phoebe buffay.
well, we both have.
well, actually it is just from me.
you know who shaved you? that was me.
i sang. (to monica) hah!
you are welcome.
what, that is it?
i do not think you mean that.
y'know what? we thought you were different. but i guess it was just the coma.
hey!
hey, you know what might help you deal with it? think of it this way, you and emily are in the past and you can not be mad about the past. so are you still mad about the louisiana purchase?
exactly! because it is in the past!
okay, then what happened?
(gasps) ohh. uh-huh. uh-huh. (the chick clucks.) you will get your turn!
nothing! (picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (to the chick.) this is not over!
what?!
hey!
what were you doing?
oh, nobody's judging you. (they all turn and look at ross.)
you two will have very hairy children.
so are you actually going to see her again?
uh-hmm.
get your foot off my contestant! judge!
ohhh.
hey!
are you serious?!
you do not need janice for that, you have got us. we…
(turning from ross.) no!! hey-hey that is not a nutter-butter, that is just an old wonton!
ohh, tough call.
hey!
dinner was good!
I am just saying hi! now I am going to go!
(to him) oh, well hello there.
(to monica) i did not see this on the menu.
oh, so you are monica’s boss?
oh! i sous stand.
oh you…you made pesto?
would you say your pesto is the best-of?
i made it myself.
well, it is no pesto.
ooh monica!
oh my god! i had the best time with tim last night. he is so sweet! oh, i can not wait to get sous-neath him.
but why?!
well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. and besides I have met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
but monica, he loves his job so much! can you just give him another chance? please?
that is fair! thank you so much. thanks. oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
love it!
hey!
but…
okay. okay, but you can not fire him today.
because I am dumping him today.
he is sweet. he is too sweet. he calls me all the time. (mimicking him) "so did-did you get home from work okay?" "did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
then he comes over! (mimicking him) "I am so worried about you." uck! be a man!
you can not fire him and dump him the same day, he will kill himself.
are you kidding?! another week with that sip, I will kill myself!
okay. but the question is who is going to go first. ‘because whoever goes second is the bitch.
come on! the boss that fires a guy that is just been dumped, bitch! and the woman who dumps a guy that is just been fired, blond bitch!
all right, that makes sense. (starts towards the door.) ugh. but—screw you I am going first! (she grabs her purse and runs out.)
hi.
it will be…in a minute. listen, tim you are a really great guy.
aw. (phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I am just—I am in a place in my life right now where i…i…
oh-oh no she does not! i know what that is. you can stay.
monica!
(simultaneously) I am breaking up with you!
I am, I am breaking up with you.
I am sorry, I am just—I am…I am just not ready for a relationship right now.
oh that is good, the chemistry thing for us too.
and tim i just want to say, good luck here. (shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts monica.)
(to monica) oh and i need to talk to you.
to see if know what these guys are talking about.
(taking ross aside) have umm, have you thought anymore about you and rachel?
yay! it is so exciting! wow, you could have done that with us there.
oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can not talk to rachel.
oh please! just before when you were asleep in the lounge! that armenian family was watching you instead of the tv. oh, that reminds me. that mr. hasmeje still has my gameboy.
hey!
are you all right?
oh my god! he did it?
are you kidding? I am like the one who talked him into it. i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
i just talked him into it, do not tell me i have to do you too. the puppet master gets tired people.
why?! you two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
especially ross!
there he goes, your fianc�e.
although he does play with himself in his sleep.
oh hey! wait up!
congratulations! i did not want to say anything in front of joey ‘because i did not know if he knew yet.
no! no, that you and rachel are engaged!
oh, it is a secret. oh goodie! yes! we have not done the secret thing in a long time.
are you lying? is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
all right, me too. (they go into her room and see that she is sleeping.) should we wake her up?
and so engaged. (points to the ring that rachel is wearing.)
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? y’know ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
really?
so whose ring is it?
is it an engagement ring?
but you did not give it to her?
but you were going to propose?
huh, i might be losing interest in this.
oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
no! no, she said you actually proposed to her.
tell him, tell him.
doing it on this table. (points at the table)
(points at joey's pen) uh, uh, give me. can you see me operating a drill press?
just for some short-term-work. you know, until i get back some of my massage clients.
no, nothing like that. i was just...such a dummie. i taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." and they are.
what... i could, i could do it. what is it?
i could be a secretary.
i could do that.
well, maybe 25-26.
there you go.
(plays with a thumbtack remover) yeah?
oh. uh, I am on. (picks up the phone)
(with a deep voice) mr. bing's office. (listens) no I am sorry, he is in a meeting right now.
will he know what this is in reference to? (listens) and he has your number? (listens) all right, I will see that he gets the message. bye bye.
ross says hi.
this is so fun. all right, what do we do now?
most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) okay, I am going to be out there.
all right. bye bye.
What are you doing?
oh, exellent. everyone was so, so nice.
no, i did not tell anybody that i knew you.
oh, because, you know... they do not like you.
i thought you knew that.
everyone. except for uh... no everyone.
do not feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you are like "mr. boss man". you know, mr. bing. mr. bing, "boss man bing".
yeah, yeah. they even do you.
you know like... uh okay... uh... 'could that report be any later?'
that is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)
ooh, oh, I have got to go. (raises) whoa, oh, head rush. one more, and then i have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) cool!
um, oh, I have got a birthday party, with some work people.
no, i know. that is a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
well, then you should come tonight. you know, just hang out with them. let them see what a great guy you still are.
i really do, yeah.
okay.
oh, but, could we not go together? i,i do not want to be the geek that invited the boss.
you were great. but they still made fun of you.
you know, now you are more like, you know like, "mr. caring boss," "mr.", you know, "I am one of you, boss," "mr., i want to be your buddy, boss man bing!"
well, you know what chandler? i think you have got to face it. you are like, the guy in the big office, you know. you are the one that hires them, that fires them... they still say you are a great boss.
uh huh. but they are not your friends anymore.
no, but you can not.
uh uh.
petrie.
hey!
oh, he has a gig. i kind of like being married to a rock star, you know. my husband has a gig.
oh, he is playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
uh-hmm.
yes! you know, in six months the statute of limitations runs out and i can travel internationally again!
i know.
ok well, before you do, i know we were not supposed to get you going away presents, (she takes something out from her pocket) but i do have something for you.
it is a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the dna to create your own pheebs!
i love you too. (they hug) please do not... do not turn into... you know... french bitch! (they hug again)
ok.
(to monica) are you wearing waterproof mascara?
oh, you are so screwed. (monica goes into the guest room)
she is going to say goodbye to each of us individually.
yeah, i know, it is going to be even worse for you... god... ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
(from the other side of the room) yeah!
these are not mine... look how flimsy they are, come on! good god! you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they will snap like a piece of licorice.
where do you think mike really is? (she giggles, chandler looks aghast)
i do not know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
you know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. it was pretty intense.
ross, if you are this upset, you should go and talk to her.
tell me about it.
all right, i think I am going to head out.
i thought i was going home to go to bed, but I am sensing there is something less fun for me to do here.
how was your night?
yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of joey's pants.)
all right, ready?
all right, here it goes...
(crying) yeah me too.
oh y’know what is sadder than this? bambi. i cried for three days with that movie. no wait two! because on the third day my mother killed herself so i was partly crying for that.
all right, what is going on there? (points to a picture.)
oh chandler!
so that story does not make you cry?
yeah?
yeah.
oh you are my biggest fan? I have always wanted to meet you! hi! (shakes his hand.) sure! yeah! (signs the autograph)
you are just saying that because you are my biggest fan. (the fan leaves and joey approaches.) (to joey) joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? (points) he is a fan. (to the fan as she is leaving) bye! (exits)
(entering) hey! what is up? (sees the tv) oh my god! what am i doing?!!
it is phoebe! phoebe!
(seeing her dress) oh god. so-so you are making porn movies.
you are making one right now!
and-and you are using my name!
look, I am talking right now! you are—you mean her.
what?!
no!! no way! no! and stop using my name! and shame on you! (yells into the apartment) and shame on all of you! you are disgusting! especially you (points to someone) with that! (storms away.)
hey!
so, i just came from the company ursula works for.
no! no! i just went to pick up phoebe buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.
um-mmm, and i will not have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address.
oh no! no! i know how to handle it.
yeah. (she notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he is seen her before.) (to him) you are trying to figure out where you know me from? all right, I will give you a hint. from porn! okay? (he tries to rush his girlfriend out.) yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (to joey) see?
joey, can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
I am sorry, it is just, I am a little short on cash.
oh no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends. no, that is why richard dreyfuss and i do not speak anymore.
you could do that?
oh my god, I am going to be on tv!
oh, really?
wow! hey, why are you all dressed up?
joey, look at me! I am a nurse!
yeah! but I am a little shaky and nervous.
okay, now. what?
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. I am just a little nervous.
okay, that helps.
hey. so, what did he say?
I am sorry, i can not do this. I am not an actor.
joey.

yes, doctor.
hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming!
(does the scene) yes, i did it!!! i nailed it!!! yay! what is next?
okay, from the top, people!
joey, listen. i can not do this, it does not make any sense. yesterday i was a nurse, and today I am a waitress at a cafe?
well, it is not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. and now suddenly I am the waitress? that is going to confuse my fans.
uhuh. because I am a single mother, supporting my two children.
wait a minute. dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. would not i come over to say hi to him?
about what?
and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky.
yeah, well, I am very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
i can not do that. I am an actor. i have a process.
wait a minute, i see what is happening here. you are threatened.
yeah, I am so good in this scene that I am stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni because i just raised the bar. come join me up here!
(entering) hello.
thank you! i know, though.
ohh, well, you are my lucky penny.
all right all ready.
we could not, would not want to wait.
i do not know, you might be the first one.
(on machine) "hi, it is me, I am coming over now. hey, what if I am already there when your playing this message?" (to the guys) is that too spooky?
ah! oh my god! you r-r-rotten boys!
what am i going to do?
monica, monica, you know what gets out hummus.
okay, thanks. yeah, I will try that.
hummus. i got the hummus.
that will not go with this dress though.
well, how could it not be breezy, no, because, you are, you are in such a breezy place.
monica, you do not know that.
oh rach, good, listen is not this perfect for me! (she is wearing another dress on a hanger around her neck)
well, of course not for tonight. yeah, hi!
(entering from rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) okay, I am ready.
rachel, did not have anything that i liked, so, but she had this christmas ribbon, and i thought,  right, fine I will be political.'
duh!! christmas!
okay, okay, okay, the black. but, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
definitely.
I will get it, okay. (answers phone) hi, monica and rachel's. (listens) yeah, just a second, can i ask who is calling. (to monica) oh, ew, it is michelle! ew! she, she must have that caller id thing. you should get that.
okay, we are on it. we are on it.
(yelling from the bedroom) get away from that! no! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) she is just getting dressed.
oh, wait, let me get you another glass. that is been sitting out.
ross, went to get a cab so we can all... no, wh-what are you doing! no, monica, no!
how did you do that?
yeah, after this, i think he will be doing that himself.
no they ran out of "it is a girl" but i can fix this one, (she writes "not" in between it is and a) see?
look at all the stuff people sent!
she is just so cute! i just want to bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
wow you guys got a hospital?  fancy!
i dunno, well he got over the "we were on a break" thing really quickly.
you know that is… that is her.
oh no, rach, no no, you know you are never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
i can say i told you so but she is kind of doing that for me.
it really does… how long do you think we have to stay?
well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! go back in time and listen to phoebe!
yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with ross!
alright you guys, we can not turn on each other, okay?  that is just what she wants.
oh I am kind of part of this.
i knew i should have married chandler.
well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I am just going to go. (she gets up and rachel looks at her, upset, and monica just stares.) no! really? misery really does love company. all right! (she sits back down.)
alright, I will try, fine! yes, okay!
shh! nothing works with this child! (hands her back.)
i have to go scream into a pillow. (goes to scream into a pillow)
(entering) have i gone deaf?
you must be a fireball in bed.
i can hear traffic and birds!  i can hear the voices in my head again! (monica looks at her strangely) I am kidding. (she smiles wickedly.)
thankfully you do not need me at all (gets up and to leave) so okay super aunt see you later! rachel let us give it six to eight months (she leaves).
hey! umm, well, only okay because i just got back from, from the hospital.
oh yeah, no-no-no. I am fine. I am okay, but umm, my grandma sorta died.
it is okay, i mean she had a really incredible life. and it is not like I am never going to see her again, y'know she is going to visit.
yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she is going to come to the coffeehouse!
it is okay. actually y'know what, it is kind of cool. because it is like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
it was really sweet. the last thing she said to me was; "okay dear, you go get the eggs and I am going to get the yogurt and we will meet at the checkout counter." and y'know what? we will meet at the checkout counter.
it is phoebe.
umm, well i sorta have some bad news, can i come in?
umm, well, umm grandma died.
no, she just died today! okay, umm, we are having a memorial service tomorrow.
no you did not!
well, lots of people! look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
fine. okay, enjoy your concert. (starts to leave.)
well hello, mrs. penella! thank you so much for coming! well, okay look, here is your umm, 3-d glasses and reverend pong will tell you when to put them on.
(notices his bag.) hey, y'know what? my grandma had the exact same bag!
thanks!
yeah, welcome.
umm here is your 3-d glasses.
so how did you know francis?
really?! what is your name?
you are frank buffay?
you just said…
but…
oh my god!
that was my dad!
uh-huh.
he said, "nice to meet you glenda." (they stare at her, dumbfounded) well, obviously i could not give him my real name?
come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! what do you think? he is going to stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
well, i said, i told him y'know, that i was the executor person of francis' will and that i needed to talk to him so I am going to meet him at the coffee house later.
all right, well, i just can not think about that right now. i just want to say good-bye to my grandma.
all right, I would better go too. i have to go talk to my dad.
umm, no, not at first because i-i do not want to freak him out
y'know it is funny, you would think I would be angry. i mean, you would think I would want to rip his tiny little head off. fortunately, I am past it.
all right.
oh! get off!! ow!! oh, stop it!! why?! why are you doing that to me?!
as a masseuse and a human, I am begging you, never do that to anyone!
(seeing the look on chandler's face) he-he does not like it! he hates it! he is in pain!
umm, thank you for meeting with me.
come, sit. (he is hesitant.) sit. (still hesitating.) sit! (he sits on the arm of the couch.) umm, all righty, before we get started i just—i need you to state for the official record that you are in fact frank buffay.
okay.
huh?
oh yes. yes. yeah—no. she did. she left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick.
okay. i have just a few questions to ask so I am going to get out my official forms. (she picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) okay, so, question 1) you and uh, you were married to francis' daughter lilly, is that correct?
okay, umm, question 2) umm, did that marriage end a. happily, b. medium, or c. in the total abandonment of her and her two children?
yeah. see? (quickly shows him.)
hmm, okay, total abandonment. okay, reasons for abandonment, a. top secret government work, b. amnesia, or c. or you are just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
what?!
but you-you-you came to see lilly?
lilly's dead. (he looks up in shock.)
she is dead.
well, if she is not then cremating her was a big mistake.
17 years ago.
well, ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in soho. and phoebe, (pause) is on this couch.
yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
yes. well, that is neither here nor there.
y'know what, it does not matter what you say it is not going to make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
that is a defense?
you make up songs?
well, i am. (moves over and takes his hand.)
not yet, no. (drops his hand and moves back.)
(to her date) okay, and then this is the coffee house. this is where i play my music. (points to the stage)
yeah, and these are my friends. people. this is vince, vince the people.
vince is a fireman.
okay. (watches him leave)
oh, jason? yeah, uh-huh, we are seeing each other tonight.
i know, i know! I am like playing the field. y'know? like, juggling two guys, I am sowing my wild oats. y'know? y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
does a dog's lips move when he reads? (joey makes an `i do not know' face, and looks to chandler and rachel, who are also stumped) okay, no they do not.
that is so great! oh, i... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) oh my god!
(the fire has worsened) oh my god!!!
(stopping him) no! no!
well, we do not n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we would, we would like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) oh my god, here they come! well, we got to get out of here!
well look, if i wanted to see a fireman, i would date one. okay? (she drags him away)
(entering with rachel) …and i-i can not take it! y'know? I am just, always afraid one of them is going to catch me with the other one. it is making me crazy.
(disgusted) uh.
well, it just, it does not feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. it is like I am working in the field.
well, vince is great, y'know `because, he is like a guy, guy. y'know? he is so burly, he is sooo very burly. (giggles)
yeah, but jason's really sensitive.
yeah.
jason is not a sissy!
god, that is the nicest kitchen.
no! but it is the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
all right. i got to go. i have break up with vince.
yeah, i like vince a lot, y'know? but, it is just jason’s so sensitive, y'know? and in the long run, i think sensitive it is just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) jason! definitely jason! okay, wish me luck!
excuse me. umm, is vince here?
wow! i did not know you guys actually used those.
umm, wow. this-this is not going to be easy. umm, i do not think we should see each other anymore.
I am sorry.
oh my god, i did not…
(running after him) wait-wait-wait! wait!!
(to ross) I am telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
(gasps) oh, you so would! oh, you should get that anyway. (they both look at her.) like for clubbing.
hey mon umm, if you do get married, can i bring two guests?
no, that was my way of telling you. well, it turns out he is incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
yeah, well he would prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
well, yeah, because i have to break up with someone, and… okay so jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so is vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) plus, vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the vince side) so… it is really just about the math.
(knocks on the door) jason?
nah-ha!
(singing) “crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (jason enters) crazy underwear, always in a rut. crazy under-(sees jason)-wear…” (in her head) oh no! what is he doing here? all right, just keep playing, just keep playing. you will get through this; you will be fine. (she tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) okay, thank you. and, as always no one talk to me after the show.
hey!
i do not know, he just started kissing me. get him! get him, vince!
yeah, okay, I have-I have been dating both of you, and it is been really horrible. ‘because y'know it is been a lot of fun, for me. umm, but i-i like you both, and i, and i did not know how to chose, so... I am sorry, I am just, I am terrible, I am a terrible person. I am terrible.
really?!
well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)
well, i made you a candle light dinner in the park.
(to vince) well, that could have been really awkward.
yeah, but i-i-i-i can do that for you, I am going to do that for you.
wow! well, if you nail the interview, you will get it!
you want to work on your interview skills?
okay! all right, let us start with the handshake. hi.
very good handshake, good wrist action.
okay. (they shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) oh my god! what did i ever do to you?! (rubbing her hand.)
let us just say, I am glad I am not chandler.
but it is just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
okay, then maybe i can come too!
all right, you go. (they kiss.)
'kay, bye!
oh god!
oh i just miss him so much!
yeah, it is weird. i can not help it though he is so sweet, he is like this little puppy dog, y'know? but like a really tough one that shots bad guys. ohh, i just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! you just like can not keep your hands off each other.
so-so how long did that last for you and chandler?
come on, seriously! when did it end?
okay, you know where you are better than i do. i was just curious.
(under her breath) god, i woke the beast. sorry. (to monica) i was wrong obviously, i just—i misspoke. it is okay.
oh we can not, we already have plans.
well, same thing we did all day, hang out at gary's apartment. he is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. but have fun at the movie.
you are not? then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
yeah!
you tired chandler?
ohh, (laughs) umm, we kind of took a little detour on the way over here.
we did! we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
ooh, ooh, fun! okay... um, liam neeson.
morly safer.
the woman who cuts my hair!
(her face dropping) oh, really.
rift’s. yeah, i know.
hmmm? yeah. so, um, is she fat?
(turning to chandler) where were you standing?
it is mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, i mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though i did it... later that same day. but, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
(jumping up) yeah?
why? why would you want to... do that?  why?
well, i mean, I am not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um... i mean, it is true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we have grown apart, so, um... i do not know, why not? okay.
yeah I am fine.
well, what i really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
ooh! bath salts would be nice.
yeah?
(smiling blankly) right, and it is me.
much as you are.
(philosophically) oh, that is good.
good choice.
ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in her lap) ..oh, this is really...
ohhh... sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag) ..okay, it fits.
that you like, (snappily confronting joey over the heads of the knitting circle) we get it. you like her. great!
alright, well, maybe now it is not okay.
okay.
where are you going?
with?
alright, could i just ask you one question?
have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
alright, so, can we turn this off? can we just make it... make them go away? because i can not, i can not watch.
okay.
yeah. it is just, you know, it is this whole stupid ursula thing, it is...
um, yeah. look, i mean, I am not saying she is like evil or anything. she just, you know, she is always breaking my stuff. when i was eight, and i would not let her have my judy jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. and then, oh, and then there was randy brown, who was like... have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
well, but that is what he was for me. and she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he would not even talk to me any more. because he said he did not want to be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
i mean, i know joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
yeah. okay.
but he is falling in love with her.
okay... okay.
oh, okay, oh.
hi!
come on in!
so how was the honeymoon?
that was the best part? (to chandler) good honeymooning tiger.
oh, greg and jenny yuck! (angrily) hi greg, I am chandler this is monica. hi monica, this is jenny. hi jenny. hi greg.
you have got to be kidding me!
monica! that is not right! start with where.
i can not believe he taped the two of them having sex!
(nasally) greg and jenny?
you got fake numbered.
excuse me, i do not want greg and jenny’s rejects.
hmm, i wonder why. pervert!
that is like the pervert motto! yeah! yeah! they have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
regina philange. (ken and regina shake hands.)
no! not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
okay fine! fine! we will just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘who came onto who,’ thing to rest! come on now, think!!
you are going to get pregnant.
oh, you came on to ross!
hi!
listen! you have to help me pick a dress because I am meeting mike's parents tonight! (rachel gasps)
(sarcastically) really? that had not occurred to me.
they live on the upper east side on park avenue!
okay, so... allright... which dress? (she holds up two 'phoebe' dresses, rachel and monica look at them... taking their time, do not wanting to hurt phoebe) you can say "neither".
so... now... what about with mike's mom?
(speaking louder and articulating) that is she is like the daughter she never had. (phoebe points at her ears) listen! (monica looks at phoebe in a duh! way)
I am wearing pantyhose!
oh, thank you! oh... oh my god, you are rich!
yeah, so... they got to die someday. (mike's parents walk in) hello!
(in a very posh accent) theodore... bitsy... what a delight!
and you... your home is lovely.
holy crap!
oh, try and stop me!
(no accent) I am trying to get your parents to like me.
(accent) got it! it... it is hard to stop...
(no accent) uhm... okay, well, allright, uhm... originally I am from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... i just moved to the city where uhm... i actually lived in a burned out buick lesabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... i got hepatitis, you know, because this pimp spit in my mouth and... but i... i got over it and uhm... anyway, now I am uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, is not always steady money but at least i do not pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit surreal, which phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) so... where does everyone summer?
god! god! this is not going well.
okay, okay, okay, okay... still sure about me being myself?
so theodore... i uhm... i can see where mike gets his good looks from...
yeah... and that physique! you must work out all the time...
yeah i bet! look out! (phoebe punches theodore right in the stomach)
oh my god, are you okay?
I am so sorry!
i really, really am sorry.
yes... I am sorry, I have never met a boyfriends parents before...
yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... she looks nice, i can talk to her.
yeah... oh bitsy, hi. uhm... listen i just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
also uhm... i just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. especially to you. because he is very respectful of women.
are you kidding. he is so considerate of my feelings and... you know i think... you would also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
(mike now enters and stands behind phoebe) oh no, no, no, no, no, no. do not get me wrong. no, he is not in like a sissy way. no, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly cat, sme-lly ca-t / i-t's not your fau-lt. and that is the end of the song... i realise that you did not ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
oh, pervert parade?
oh, ode to a pubic hair?
oh god! is that veal?
oh no, no, no, no... that is okay, that is okay... i mean, I am... i am a vegetarian... except for veal... yeah no, veal i love...
no, no, no, i actually it is any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... clearly not enjoying the meat...) hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except mike. he is making a hmmmm.... face... then phoebe swallows it) hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. you hear a door slamming.)
yeah... the woman you what?
i love you too...
yeah...! how great is this...? (they kiss)
okay.
i had a great time. (accent) it was really top drawer. and here is something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... i threw up in the coat closet... ta taaa...
(holding a lure) so now, what is this now?
(laughs and picks up another lure) and this?
(laughs harder) you make it so funny.
hey!
i would, but i get my morning sickness in the evening.
unless! she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
do not you just love the way they talk?!
ohh!
it kicked! i think the baby kicked!
oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
why?
ohh! so, did you get to meet her?
(going over to comfort her) aww, pheebs.
that is short for phoebe?! i thought that was just what we called each other!
shhh!! please! what is he saying?
what? oh my god!
well, look, why do not you just, why do not you do your phase two strip club thing with us.
come on! let us be guys! maybe we want to be guys!
y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
I am sorry. (goes and hugs him)
oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘because I am pregnant.
ha-ha, it is not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (he leaves.)
(doing the same) i really, really enjoyed it. very exotic.
come on! look where you are!!
remember, a virgin for me please.
well, if you think it will help.
you should! how is she?
who, josh?
oh no! wait! wait! okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. we really were not great at being guys, but you know why? because we are girls.
and do you know what girls are really good at?
no, listening! sit! y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
yeah, i really liked that fighter pilot one.
yeah.
oh! what is that? what is that?
hey—ooh so, how was vermont?
i-i want to be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) i like her.
oh come on, they can be in the same room.
why? what happened now?
wait. why was he yelling at her? he is the one who slept with someone else.
whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first you are really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together, they never broke up. and we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
yeah, and nobody slept with that xerox girl.
(turning around and picking a cup off of a table) oh, hey, look, i found coffee! (handing her the cup) okay, let us skedaddle.
okay, your highness.
(in a deep voice, imitating ross) um, rachel I am really sorry. (imitating rachel) that is okay, do you want to get back together? (imitating ross) yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) did anyone else hear that?!
no, it is just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
ohhh boy, do i feel bad.
chandler what are you doing?!
why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
him? him, ross?
wait. really?! ‘because mine get me out of tickets.
well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know rachel’s sister’s cabin. (chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)
y'know what, i can stay, I am going to stay. ‘because the last time i went skiing i was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, i just went around and around.
chandler!!
what does the sign say?
no, the ‘no smoking’ sign. there is no smoking in my grandmother’s cab.

but if...
oh good, oh joey and chandler are back.
(answering the phone) (whispering) ross, thank god.
i ate a bug.
listen ross, we ran out of gas, and we do not know where we are, so we can not get a tow truck.
yes, please.
oh, it is ross on one of his drives!
hi!
(to chandler and monica) you guys, what, what do we do about ross who drove all the way up here? what do we do? just like send him back and we are then going to go skiing?
y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
hey! hey! hey! hey!! hey!!! (they all stop fighting, chandler continues to dance.) look what you are doing to chandler!! (chandler finally stops) (to ross and rachel) yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. okay? (ross starts to leave) you do not, all right you do not have to love each other, okay? you do not, you do not even have to like each other much right now. but please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
yeah, otherwise, i mean that is, that is, that is just it for us hanging out together. y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) can you be civil?
okay. good, all right, let us get back in the car, ‘because it is freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
or, or the rodeo!!
okay!
bye!!!
...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;
(smiling) uh-huh.
oh, i like my job.
so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some very important people to me. (singing:)
yeah, chandler why do not you take a walk? this does not concern you.
no-no, we do it every year!
no, yeah, we never find them! she is always best at us, that wily... minx.
oh no, we have to!
well then, you should look with us.
oh, that is it? (mimics chandler) a great idea! oh yeah.
ooh ooh, we have a live one!
ooh, who is it for?
ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i was getting gas?
you guuuyys.
(simultaneous to the others) ble-blah-blar blargh!
(simultaneous to the others) blah blargah, blar-blab.
(at the window) hey look, you guys, it is snowing!
are not we done with that?
chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined.
now give me my real gift.
(to chandler) thank you.
wait, does he eat chalk?
just, because, i do not want her to go through what i went through with carl- oh!
no.
ooh! oh! (she starts to pluck at the air just in front of ross.)
fine!  be murky!
 if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
(sings) raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (rachel and monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... la la la la...something and noodles with string.  these are a few...
(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to chandler and joey.) i helped!
what does that mean?   does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (chandler does not know.)
ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes. that can not be good.
oh, i wish i could, but i do not want to.
(singing) love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  la-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) thank you. (sings) la-la-la-la...ohhh!
oh no, do not hate, you do not want to put that out into the universe.
all right, c'mere, give me your feet. (she starts massaging them.)
give her a break, it is hard being on your own for the first time.
you are welcome. i remember when i first came to this city. i was fourteen. my mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i did not know anybody. and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel.
(sings) i can not believe what I am hearing here...
(sings) what i said you had...
oh, was i doing it again?
why? just because you are too lazy to get up off your touchie?
(smiles) okay! (goes to answer the phone.)
(answering the phone) hello? (listens) hey joey!
sure! where is it?
ohh! so you are 5639?!
(to joey) ooh, do you want to talk to chandler?
who was that?
yeah! (she hands the phone to chandler.)
monica! I am sorry I am late! (starts looking around for her) monica? (goes into monica's bedroom.)
(saddened) it is okay. what the hell took you so long?
which richard?
richard simmons?! oh my god!
oh! okay, that actually makes more sense. so how was it?
that is so weird! i had a dream that you would have lunch with richard.
but again, simmons. go on.
ooh! so now why can not we tell chandler?
oh, i can not believe you guys lasted a whole year!
wow! i owe rachel 20 bucks!
on a totally different bet.
awww! now you are just my annoying friend chandler.
okay, I am going to go too!
oh please, you are not going to ditch again like you did with london.
uh-huh, great story! I am going!
hey!
hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we are all going to go to las vegas to surprise joey! including me!! you want to go?!
of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
naked alone time.
uh-huh! why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
so, so far is this trip to vegas better or worse than the trip to london?
okay, what about after i give you these candies? (hands them each one from her purse.)
ah-ha! okay, (takes out a notepad) las vegas 1, london 0! I will be right back. (gets up and heads aft.)
(sitting down) oh good! all right, so you decided to tell him about the richard thing.
oh no. [the patented version.]
(to monica under her breath) simmons! go with simmons!
okay, london 1…
hey you guys wait! guys! (catches up to them.) this place is so much better than london! okay? this lady dressed like cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. huh!
for 99 cents, I would eat you. (sees the casino) okay, i can totally settle down here. it is got everything i could ever want, including joey! look! (points to joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) oh! look! hi!
hey! joey! (they all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) hey! hey!! wow! (she hugs him.)
why are you dressed as a gladiator?
so you are a gladiator! wow!
monica had lunch with richard.
noo! but that would have been so cool!
i love vegas!
thanks.
y'know monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with chandler. big deal! it is only chandler. (monica turns and stares at her.) i am so sorry.
so go fix it! go find chandler! he is probably up in your room! tell him that you are sorry and that you love him.
sure! (when monica gets close to the door.) (yelling) yeah! las vegas, number one!
hey!
yeah?
ohh, you are so lucky! (to chandler) hey! so, where is monica? did you guys make up?
but she just came up here!
i wonder where she is. that is so weird.
would you stop that! do you want to know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with richard? she did not feel anything for him. she loves you!
yes! now, she feels terrible! she really wants to make up! you got to find her.
good. (after he leaves, she puts on joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) i should really start wearing hats!
(sees ross and rachel) hey!
you guys are here! yay!
(sees rachel's face) what? did you go to a costume party? let me guess umm pancho vila? (points at rachel) and you are bob saget. (an old lady has sat down at the slot machine phoebe was just at.)
yeah! (motions to her face, indicating all of rachel's "make-up.")
whoa, what kind of party was this?
ugh!
that is like the third time that lady's won on a machine i was playing.
m-m-mole people?
oh. what is a lurker?
kills you?
ohhh!
how do you know about this?
dance karate?
(seeing her) get out of here you lurker! (she does not move) go on! get! (she throws a quarter at her.)
ohh! you made up!
ohh, get a room.
i know. use it.
oh well, lost again. (she gets up and slowly moves away. the lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) that is it! you and me, outside!
be cool! (they both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) okay lady, your lurking days are over!
yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I am going to lurk first! you move on to someone else, I am going to be one step ahead of you, every single time! and then I will be on your ass every hour of every day 'til monday, because that is when i go home. when do you leave?
what time? maybe we can share a cab!
i won! i won! i finally won!
fine! here! take a hike toots! (gives back her quarter.)
(quietly) sells drugs to kids.
she sells drugs to kids. (the guard looks at the lurker.)
how about we talk about this over dinner?
no! no, you can not arrest me! no!! i will not go back! i will not go back to that hell hole!!
oh, okay. (walks out.)
(entering and sitting down at the table.) hello. my name is regina phalange. I am a businesswoman in town on business. would you like to see my card? (looks down) ooh, what did i do with my file-a-facts? i must have left it in conference room b.
oh my god! may i just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! they are identical! now, I have never seen anything like that in the business world.
no, you threw out phoebe. I am ms. regina phalange. phalange!
wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
(entering) hey!
hey you guys! look what i just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
i bought them off ebay! they used to belong to the late shania twain.
oh... then i overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
(coming back from the bathroom) what is up? (she sees the gift certificate in rachel's hands) hey, rachel!!
no, you can not go there! you know how i feel about these "big massage places"! they are putting people like me out of business!
ok, this is not about the money, ok? it is about... it is about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
well, do you care about friendship?
i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, do not use this gift certificate. I am asking you as a friend.
promise?
thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
ok. do we have to talk like that then they are not around? (she sees rachel) oh, no, no! listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
but that woman can not know i work here. she is a friend of mine and i made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
because it is good money! but that does not change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
(watching around and whispering) ok, are they listening?
(in a strange heavy accent) hello "ja", it is time for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole.
okay, then I am swedish...
it is a normal swedish name... ikea...
ja!
(pushes her head back down) time for your scalp massage!
is something wrong?
(thinks for a few moments) uhm... stockholm.
(singing) "ipan stripan, glupi glabi! " and that is the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
oh, ja! ja!
uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you are such a high maintenance tight ass!
you know it is me?
how can you come here?
i do not have to tell you everything!
tips not included.
because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now I am this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes!
you know what? you are right. i am going to quit. it is time i took my life back!
ok.
okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) if you guys have microphones in there too, i did not mean any of that. i love you.
(imitating the receptionist's tone) good morning receptionist.
rachel green? (angrily) son of a bitch, she came back?
(through the door, with a scottish accent) are you ready for your scottish massage? put your face in the hole, lassy.
(looking around) who is cell phone is that? it is just so annoying; everywhere you go.
(checks) i never get calls!! (answers the phone) hello?
oh my god eric hi! wait, how did you get this number?
wow! what an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
oh you did? (to rachel) he did it! he did it!
shhh! I am talking.
are you asking me out? ‘because it would be kind of weird since you just broke up with my sister.
no! wait! i was just saying that so you would think i was a good person. fight for me.
not great, but we can work on it at lunch. okay, i can be at your apartment in two hours.
I have got friends too. okay, bye.
oh my god! I am going out with eric! ooh, this day is really going to be so much better than i thought it was going to be. oh ross, i can not make lunch. (exits.)
hi!
yeah, me too. not in the shaky angry way you are though.
oh.
yeah. (covers her face with her hand.) yeah.
maybe this is too weird.
no do not tear out your eyes!!
oh, yeah try that. (he finishes and looks at her.) so, is that better?
look eric, turn around. (he does so.) look, i like you, but it should not be this hard. y’know? this is our first date y’know? first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(he kisses her)…second kisses. (motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)
ooh, oh no! i have to go! i have a massage appointment.
no, i got in trouble for that before. I will see you later.
really? that is the thing I am worse at! you will see. (exits.)
(entering) hey!
hey! (jumps on the bed with him.) can we pick up where we left off?
why?
what sex?
we did not have sex.
(simultaneously as eric) ew! ew! ew! ew! ew! ew!
you-you…you had sex with ursula?!
you did not notice she was wearing different clothes?!
oh. ew! ew! ew! ugh! y’know what? this is too weird.
so i guess this is it.
yeah, so do you.
hey!
no, but he is always late.
yeah, i did. i think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘frank’s always late.’
no, i know, I am just nervous. y'know it is just y'know mom’s dead, do not talk to my sister, grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. it is like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kind of thing. you are so sweet to wait with me.
(entering) everbody this is frank! this is my half-brother frank.
this is everybody. this is ross.
chandler.
joey.
this is monica.
and this is rachel.
I am going to get coffee.
oh yeah! yeah, no, we are going to connect, y'know bond, and everything.
(sits up) oh, ew!
yeah i know what i wanted to ask you. um, can you roll your tongue? because i can, and my mom could not, and i thought y'know, i figured that was something i got from our dad.
yeah, yeah. you can do it to. (tries to do it, but can not)
oh right, yeah okay, my mom could, and i can not. we do not have that....
feburary 16th.
wow, that is close. when is yours?
that is the same month as halloween. so, um, what kind of things do you like to do at home?
okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
so is it like art?
um, yeah sure. why you want to call your mom?
oh, well um, not right now. y'know I am just going to go to bed, i think the fumes are giving me a headache.
g’night, bro.
here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) y'know, just in case.
no kind. he just makes it up.
so far, it kind of blows. i do not know, i just thought y'know that he would feel more like a brother y'know, like you and ross, just like close and connected and....
ah!!
oh, how do you play the shadow game?
i just asked you.
i do not have time for this.
which you just gave up really quickly.
build the unit cinderelly, lay the tile cinderelly.
yeah. (phone rings and phoebe answers it) ‘hello. (listens) oh my god, i totally forgot! (listens) well can not someone else do it. (listens) but, i have company. (listens) yeah, no look, that is all right I will come in.’ (hangs up phone) um, frank, I am really sorry but i have to go to work. it is-it is one of my regulars and he is insisting that i do ‘um.
oh! I am a masseuse. i give people massages and stuff.
well, y'know we do not call it that, but yeah!
all righty. I will be back in-in a little bit. unless you want to come with me?
no, no, you can get one yourself. it will be on the house! y'know what are big sisters for?
no, no, no, i would not do you myself, i mean that would be weird. yeah, no, I will get one of the other girls to do it. oh, this will be so much fun! hey! are you excited?
hey!-hey! what is going on?
you can not have sex with her!
okay, jasmine, can you, can you ask mr. whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
(turns around and hits frank) so that is what you thought i did!! god! that is not what i do!
nooo! why would you think that?
whatever, it is the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
you really thought it was perfect?
yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
i do not....
right, okay, um-mm.
yeah, i guess i do, yeah.
well, i-i was not hopping mad, y'know.
okay. all right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
uh-huh.
she was not a hooker.
maybe all the rulers are wrong.
hi. um, i want to start with a song that is about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. ok, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) ok, thank you very much.
can i borrow the phone? i want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to monica) what is my number?
well, i never call me.
(at window) eww, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.
oh... milwaukee.
oh, rachel.
(singing) new york city has no power, and the milk is getting sour. but to me it is not scary, because i stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)
about what?
what surprise party?
well, he did not tell me.
this is so typical. I am always the last one to know everything.
yuh-huh! i was the last one to know when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. i was the last one to know when you had a crush on joey when he was moving in. (monica gestures at phoebe to shut up; joey looks surprised but pleased) looks like i was second to last.
oh, poor little tooty is scared to death. we should find his owner.
(stops at a door) oh no, the mendels, they hate all living things, right?
(trying to hold back the struggling cat) he seems to hate you. are you sure?
wait a minute. what is his name?
(the cat runs away from her) oooh! you are a very bad man!
alright. i looked all over the building and i could not find the kitty anywhere.
ah! well! there you go! last to know again! and I am guessing... since nobody told me... this is paolo.
(smiling) you betcha!
i know, i just want to bite his bottom lip. (rachel looks at her) but i will not.
you know, did you ride mopeds? because I have heard... (they stare at her)... oh, i see... it is not about that right now. ok.
oh, look look look. the last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark)
thanks.
hey! new wallet, huh?
oh please, somebody tell me i do not have to go to work today!
oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time i see him i just want to do things to him that I am not allowed to charge for.
oh no, it is forbidden! no-no, mrs. potter fires people for fooling around with clients. and it is against my oath as a masseuse.
no, i made myself take an oath. yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. yeah, that one’s actually from the boy scouts, but it just makes good sense.
no, i can handle it. no, I am a professional. (she starts to leave)
i do not what your talking about. (laughs nervously and continues to leaqve)
because it is arabian princess day at work! okay?! leave me alone!
these old things.
you mean the—okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
sure, yeah, no i can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. so umm, tell me rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
oh. (she goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)
no!
(entering) hey.
ohh, you guys, remember that cute client i told you about? i bit him.
on the touchy.
no, i know! i-I am sorry, but the moment i touch him, i just want to throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
(thinking to herself) okay, baseball. rick, playing baseball. okay, slides into second, maybe even his pants come down a little… oh no—wait no, no! no! okay, all right, sandwiches, sandwiches. umm, okay, on a plate, maybe rick’s pants come down a little. no! no! okay, chandler! okay chandler, ooh, that is working.
(thinking to herself) chandler’s knees. chandler’s… ankles. chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) oh no. (to rick) okay, you are all set.
yeah! in… really long hour world.
ugh, okay, i have an enormous crush on you. but because you are a client, i can not ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.
really?!
what?
(laughs) okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)
oh yeah, oh and i know, but this is not what it looks like, ‘because rick is my ahh, husband.
yes, i will tell her.
hey! so i had a great day, rick and i really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a who are.
it is so weird, i have never been fired from anything before!
i just-i just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? i-i started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. then these policemen, thought i was a who are too. it is been a really bad day, who are wise.
yeah, they thought i was a who are.
great! thank you very much.
hey! i got you a present!!
i got it for your wedding and i ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
it is a ms. pac-man machine!!
i did not know where to put it so i just left it here for now.
do you really like it?
oh really? what was your first?
no. no! yes! ahh. oh, would you look at that monica? i just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
oh, I am sorry. i did not hear you over all the winning.
wait okay, if this game is going to because problems between the two of you, then maybe i should just keep it.
yeah! it is not like it spits out a clark bar after every game.
(entering) hey, you guys. listen, I am sorry that i was hogging the game before—(sees the top ten list)—oh my god! your friends have some unfortunate initials!
chandler sucks! he could not have gotten this good!
i know!
do not touch me!!
i can not!! i can not!! (she dies.) noooooooo!!!!!!! you son of a bitch!!!!!
oh hi ben—no!! do not look at the machine! (covers the screen.)
why??
oh...you do not have to go, i have something that will fit you.
i want you to stay.
why do not you turn them inside ou...
I will miss you.
great! ok...I will go get the tube top.
wow, mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say "hell yeah!"
yeah! let us do it! let us live together! (they embrace and mike kisses phoebe) oh god, we are really going to move in together!
I have always wanted to live with a guy. "pick up your socks!" "put down the toilet seat!" "no! we are not having sex anymore!" it is going to be fun!
hey you guys! ok, we have got great news.
i know it is so exciting! you know I have never lived with a guy before.
okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
uh huh...we are playing you two.
monica slow down! ok? I am just excited to be living with him. you know i mean, i do not know, can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah. y'know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do.
i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom!
yeah! you bet roomy!
oh please, these guys, we have not even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. they begin to leave. phoebe bolts back)
china patterns!!!!!
oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it is a play on the word roomy.
oh no! no no! not at all. we are just moving in right now. see where it goes.
what do you mean?
oh. wow.
was it really that bad?
ok, well that is bad. but do not you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in the ocean.
but it is just...
oh!
no! i definitely do not want to get married. no i just wanted to make sure you did not want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there is going to be hell to pay mister!
yeah i get that.
hi
listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage.
no...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
mike does not ever want to get married.
never.
i want to, but i just want you to tell me that marriage is not really that big a deal. you know that i will not, i will not be missing out on anything. that marriage stinks!
that is not how you really feel is it?
seriously? you divorce-of?
it is ok that is how you feel.
i do love mike.
yeah i guess you are right. yeah thanks. this helped. thanks.
it is not cooler.
better.
oh yeah you were helpful! yeah, no, thanks you.
what do you mean?
they are awfully boxy...
uh huh.
just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there is no wiggle room? none at all?
right. except that i do want to get married.
someday.
i have not exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it is my turn some of the regular stuff.
because i just did not know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and i wanted to live with you.
but i do not think i can! it was ok to move in when i did not know what was going to happen, but i can not move in knowing that nothing is ever going to happen.
are you going to change yours?
me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.
i do not want it to end either.
yeah.
okay! okay! okay! (they run into the chapel.)
(to her) hey! do not you give me any of your—hey! (sees chandler and monica standing there.)
well, maybe you would not have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!
what is the big deal, y’know? it is not like it is a real marriage.
yeah, if you get married in vegas, you are only married in vegas.
(shocked) really?!
oh my god!—eh! well…
oh joey, I am so sorry. you want some of my breakfast?
what about my cab?
no, joey! you borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
i do not know, it is such a long trip.
are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
all right. although i do not think we need one, i never stopped loving you.
um-hmm, yeah. they left me a message; they should be here any minute.
well you do not.
good! good! i was just testing you.
no, we were talking about tennis. tennis is more believable.
uh-huh! ross invited us all to watch.
hell, I am drunk right now! (they all turn and look at her.) what? i can not have a mimosa with breakfast?! I am on vacation!
oh-oh, that is your thing.
you are thing. you are thing. y’know? you are the guy who gets divorced.
yes you do! this is your third divorce! you love divorce so much you are probably going to marry it! then it will not work out and you are going to have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (pause) I am so drunk.
okay, you have 19 questions left. use them wisely. (joey groans.) come on joey! you can not win if you do not ask any (sees that he is asleep) questions!!!
well, you promised me a fun road trip! we have been on the road six hours and you have been asleep for five and a half! we are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! that will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
yeah! and until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
sing!!
(to joey) how could you pick up a hitchhiker?! he could be a rape—(she holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a killer or something!
y’know what? I am not talking to you! you go back to sleep! (to the hitchhiker) and you, are you a rapist?!
do you like car games?
i love the license plate game!
no-no! you need your sleep. night-night! shh! (she closes the partition.)
oh, okay.
and i have your name and the fact that you are a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
stop it! stop it no! that is not fair! y’know i can not resist that beautiful voice!
you can still sleep at night and stuff.
okay. is it a kind of hot sandwich?
is it a meatball sub?
no thanks, I have already seen one.
always.
what?!
well that is no way to sell newspapers. why do not you try, "extra! extra! read all about it!"
hey! oh, how did baby shopping go?
what?!
well did she know you two were not married?
oh my god! well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
sounds like you are a little jealous.
is that a real place? (rachel’s stunned) are they hiring?
hey chandler, why so fancy?
wait, i think i know someone who does that.
yeah, just do not get your hopes up.
well, the interview…
y’know! you do not make a very good first impression.
oh you do not know.
yes, when i first met you, you were like, "blah, blah, blah." i was like, shhh!
well it is just like you are trying too hard. always making jokes, y’know, you just—you come off a little needy.
oh! it is okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
all right, do not freak out! okay? i-i will help you. how long before you have to leave?
i can not help you.
all right, all right, we will just do our best. okay? so let us say I am the interviewer and I am meeting you for the first time. okay. "hi! come on in, I am uh, regina philange."
bing, what an unusual name.
um-hmm, that is good to know. but let us stop focusing on what you do not do, and start focusing on what you do do.
i see. nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
you got to go!
okay, do not worry. you are ready.
absolutely! just fight all your natural instincts and you will be great.
(entering, carrying her massage table) hi!
yeah.
ohh, I am getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. y’know, i have to find a job where i carrying a smaller table. (she goes over and stands in front of the tv.)
you mean like a doctor?
ohh! (she moves.) oh my. oh, that reminds me, i have to see my ob-gyn today.
oh my god!
why do not take care of this one, and should i get pregnant again, I will hold onto your card, okay?
three? you guys were worried i would not even have one!
well, yeah.
oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!! so i-i mean so in a few months I am going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! oh! oh! and it is going to be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
what do you know?!
ooh! hi!
oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you are umm, you are walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "oh, that is nice?"
okay, yeah well, good news, you are going to have three babies.
oh god, I am so glad you guys are happy, i was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
no, no maybe ‘because it is harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…
no, back to happy. back to happy!
no you can not quit college! no! you are in college? really?
you can not give up on your dream.
hey.
well, frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! i need to make a lot of money really fast, and i had an idea that i want to talk to you (points to chandler) about, ‘because you work for a big company. okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
(entering carrying a case) ooh, good, you are hear! okay.
hi!
oh this, well I am glad you asked. (she opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) now, do not you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (she efficiently cuts it in half.) ahh! now, i know what you are thinking…
no!
no!
no-no, i know that, but i just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
my saturn dealership.
ooh-ooh! i did it! i did it! i figured out a way to make money! I am going to open up my own massage place and frank’s going to help me! and! we can work it around his schedule so he does not have to quit school!
I am telling it! I am telling it!
okay. you know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so i just figured we could combine the two, okay, i give the massages and frank drives! i can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I have got?
no! think about it, it is a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it is…
the name was my favourite part!
you did not!!!! oh! no! you came up with relaxi cab! that is not good.
hey, tell him about relaxi-taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that is better than relaxi cab.
oh, that is better.
ooh, what is going on?
good for you!
of course we can. congratulations. (they hug, but joey shakes his head.) yay! (she gestures joey to come and join in) joey...
you okay with this?
talking to ross.
well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins... anyway... hey, is not joey's agent estelle leonard?
she died.
yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic. (chandler and monica look puzzled) oh, wait a minute, i read the wrong one.
yeah, she was just an agent.
well, we cannot tell joey about this. he is already flipping out about everything that is changing. this will push him over the edge.
well, not for a little while. let us just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
hey. everything ok?
estelle? why?
I am guessing she does.
well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. all right, i got to go. just listen. promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)
man, tough week for estelle!
hey joey, want come with me to… are you ok?
no, that would not kill her. ordinary embolism might.
no, no, no! do not call her! you wait for her to call you (joey considers it)
because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
(picking up her bag) all right, so promise you are going to wait for her to call you?
(on the other side of the line, still pretending to be estelle) joey, it is estelle. (joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
yeah, i wanted to call and tell you that there is no hard feelings for firing me.
well, i did not think i should just drop by...
anyway, you did what you had to do. I am okay.
(looks around) it is alright. look kiddo, i got to go. good luck with the career. you are going to be huge.
oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of celery, and i have one: regular celery.
regular celery! (starts to write that on her list) oh, i already have that. (she gets up and heads for her room)
hey you guys I am going to go out and take a walk.
oh, it is not!
it is just my knitting that is all! (a dog sticks its head out of phoebe's bag. everyone looks puzzled.) yes! i knit this. I am very good.
(answering the phone) hi geller-bing residence. how can i help?
I am sorry, who is this?
no, there is no dog here?
oh my god! where are you? (looks around.)
(phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. she gasps.) they are here already? how are they doing this?
there is no dog in here.
no that is just me coughing! (doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. phoebe comes out of the room.) oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room.
well, I am watching it for some friends who went out of town. wait. (she bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) hello, my name is clunkers. may i please stay with you nice people?
that is odd, because this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
are you crazy?
why?
you do not like ice cream?
all right. we are going to take clunkers to ross’s. we will be back in a minute. (gets up with monica to do so.)
oh, I would say about a month.
(doing clunkers) please do not leave me, I will be lonely.
yeah, okay.
you know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and chandler would not even know.
I have had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea. he is not so smart.
yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, did not you?
where is chandler?
wash your hands!!!
(interrupts him) no, no, we do not really have time for this right now. okay, we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom.
see, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (she rushes into her room)
(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) hey, is chandler here?
okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
(interrupts her, to monica) shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we will not.
we have good news, look whose back!
it is a thanksgiving miracle!
yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(realizes, that chandler starts to not believing her) i went to far, did not i? when should i have stopped?
the exclamation point in the title scares me. (gesturing) y'know, it is not just freud, it is freud!
oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
based on this play? ...based on this play!
(reading monica's palm) no, because this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
oh, yeah. that is not true. ross, is this your fantasy?
(to rachel) i can not believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
yeah, you are, monica. remember when i lived with you? you were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) ree! ree! ree! ree!
ree! ree! ree! ree! ree!
seriously, what-what is the part?
no, i do not think this was your shot. i mean, i do not even think you just get one shot. i really believe big things are going to happen for you, i do! you have got to just keep thinking about the day that some kid is going to run up to his friends and go 'i got the part! i got the part! I am going to be joey tribbiani's ass!'.
i know! (phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can not open it with one hand, but does not want to let go of mike's hand. she tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
yeah, i kind of do. (mike let us go of her hand) well, how is this? (she takes mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. after that, they hold hands again. joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)
I am sorry... I am sorry. it is obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
(in a flash she answers) maybe not, is it?
(impatient) i know mike, why do not you keep digging?
oh, it is a key. to be honest, i think I would prefer the five dollars.
(really surprised) oh wow, ooh! ooh, big step for phoebe and mike.
oh no, i want to.
yeah... ooh... wow... even started to think I would never meet someone that, you know, i wanted to... do this with. here you go. (both phoebe and mike look really proud.)
it really is.
(gasps) oh my god! david!
(excited) no! it is a great time, come in...! wow, hi... oh my gosh! what are you doing here? are you back from minsk?
who cares, it got you here.
wow. where is your luggage? (david thinks for a while)
a-allright, well... I will call the cab company.
thank you! god, no! you should see me when... oh actually, no, i look pretty good.
no...
I am... I am just... I am the worst person ever. how can i not tell david that I am seeing mike?
he said: are you seeing someone? and i said no...
yeah! i mean, i do not know. i was just , i was looking, i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking: oh my god! it is david. david's here. he is just, he is so irresistible.
really? chandler?
oh.okay, then it gets worse, because then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night.
i know! (points at herself) evil! and... and... and... i like mike so much, you know. it is just going really well. oh my god!
(sarcastically) uhuh... yeah...!, you know. and given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am.
i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that nothing can happen between us. unless i do not... you know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
okay, i knew i should have had this conversation with joey.
hey!
okay. (and she walks away)
no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
oof...
oh, wait, wait!
no, no, it is not that. (they go sit on the couch) uhm... remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well, uhm... i am. his ... his name is mike.
yeah, i should have told you.
I am sorry, I am sorry.
i am happy.
well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.
of course, yeah.(they hug and phoebe sighs... a little after that also david sighs and makes his way to the door) you know, a kiss on the cheek would not be totally inappropriate...
i mean... (david kisses phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)
yeah?
well, if that is what they do in minsk... (they kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... david turns to the door) in new york... it is... (and then david grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... they kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
hmmm... no, no... no, i can not do this. it is bad.
no, no. no.
look david, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we would probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and i-I am with mike and i really care about him...
(points to david) and you thanks for the face massage. thank you.
no, no, no, no, no... it is not... it is not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. i was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
no, uhm... david and i did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in minsk. he is only... he is only in town for a couple of days.
no, no...
oh, well, yeah...
stop it! stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and phoebe gets david's jacket and gives it to him) here david, you should just go.
okay, well... guys?
I am sorry, I am so sorry. if you... if you want your key back, i totally understand.
right! never! never! i swear! (they kiss... the door opens and david comes in again.)
oh, ok, you know what i do not get? the way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
you know, if you want, I will do it with you.
no, i mean you break up with janice and I will break up with tony.
yeah, i know, he is sweet, but it is just not fun anymore, you know? i do not know if it is me, or his hunger strike, or, i do not know.
(to rachel) what is the matter? why so scrunchy?
(rhythmically) uh-huh, uh-huh.
are you going to go over there?
this is nice. we never do anything just the two of us.
eww, i do not want to do that.
ok, have a good break-up.
yeah, it was really hard.
ok, you were not there.
ok, you can do this. it is just like pulling off a band-aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
oh my god. (chandler downs another espresso.) how many of those have you had?
chandler, easy, easy. go to your happy place. la la la la la la la.
all right.
wait here. breathe.
it is like a gift.
oh, I would like that.
(seeing rachel's clothes) what a neat idea. all your clothes match. I am going to do this.
hey, how did it go?
oh, he needed some time to grieve.
that oughta do it.
(entering, holding a pair of roller blades) hi.
oh! since tomorrow. i met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that is he is going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
I am going to let him.
oh, there is no such thing as an innocent burger.
um, chandler, ross, this is robert.
(to robert) you have have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). that is okay, it is mine, we just kissed.
I will have coffee.
hey!
oh, okay, i learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
oh, i get more because I am dainty.
yeah, in the back. you want a quarter?
what? (the guys keep laughing.) what? you guys, what is going on? you not like robert? (the guys keep laughing.) why are you laughing?!
you guys!! come on!
what do you mean?
hey.
hey. ooh! do not sit down!
yeah. and, first here is a gift.
that is all right, that is well, i figured.... (they start to leave as joey enters.)
listen, robert’s going to be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
please, right now, no, every time i see him it is like ‘is it on the lose?’ ‘is it watching me?’
hey.
no, i can spot you from here.
okay, listen robert...
umm, i think you are really, really great...
i-i-i-i-i do not know, i do not know what to say.
rachel! come on out! monica made breakfast!
yeah, but you should not compare yourself to me.
i did it! one mile on a hippity-hop! that is it!! that is everything i wanted to do before i was thirty. oh, except i wanted to patch things up with my sister. but oh well. yay!! (they all cheer again.) and-and girls this thing is a godsend if you know what i mean. (rachel and monica look intrigued and as they all head into central perk, rachel picks up the hippity-hop that phoebe left behind.)
oh, well get in line missy. (to ross) so, can i have a ride stud?
(getting out) okay, who is next?
really?! ‘because y’know that hurts.
least of all you.
(running up) okay. okay, here is what we are going to do. okay, I am going to break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. you guys push it forward so ross can drive out of his spot. okay? all right, here we go. (she opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as ross jumps in behind the wheel. she inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) haul ass!!!! (runs off.)
happy thirtieth birthday! here! (hands her the hippity-hop.) it is for the child in you, and the woman. happy thirtieth!
because it is our thirtieth birthday.
wait! (knocks on the door and ursula opens it.)
yeah. what?!
nu-uh!
you have your birth certificate?
our mom.
do you have my birth certificate?
(reading the certificate) oh my god! oh my god, we are 31.
i just lost a whole year of my life.
your middle name is pamela?
well, i never knew mine. do you remember what it is?
that is my first name.
hey, what is going on?
yay! i love drunk monica!
ohh! all right! all right. here is what we will do, I will get twice as drunk as monica and then no one’s will even notice her.
oh let me guess, and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother.
if you could do that, I would marry the hippity-hop.
(clinking two glasses together) speech! speech! let us hear from the birthday girl! huh?
do not you see? everyone is looking at me! the plan’s working! i did not even have to take off my top yet!
(screaming) wooo!! hoo!!
(to joey) okay quick, help me get this off! (motions to her top.)
i lost a whole year! i can not believe it! this is so unfair!
will it? will it?! i mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
plus, it totally ruined my schedule! i…i have not done any of the things i wanted to do by the time i was 31!
like okay i-i-i, i have not met any portuguese people! i, i have not had the perfect kiss! and i have not been to sniper’s school!
no, i just feel like being by myself for a while. all right? I will see you guys later. thanks. (gets up and exits.)
oh yeah.
oh! (phoebe walks away smiling.)
you did the right thing.
hey!
it is really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
so what did you two do about it?
but really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
yeah! now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall?
yes. we are here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
well, i think you are going to appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)
and we do not want any recognition. this is completely anonymous.
mr. x and phoebe buffay.
buffay is spelled b-you-f-f-a-y.
sure, i so glad we did this. it feels so good!
oh, look! and we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)
mhm... it is moist.
hello, is this the creepy residence?
awe, this is so sweet of you! but you know what? i will not be needing a veil, i actually will not be wearing a dress at all!
no, no, no, we are not having a big reception, we took the money we were going to spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
we, you know, we are different! we do not care about having a huge party. (she picks up the veil) this is really nice for you, but, oh, please, i put this on? (she puts it on) and, ow, i look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) all right, well, who cares, i do not need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
city hall.
it is ok, it is ok. i made my decision. what i really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
well, I will just ask for it back!
it is for our wedding day! right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us going to have to start flirting.
the donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.
yeah. see, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we did not want, but it turns out we do.
i am sorry. i am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
hey, that is not fair! a person’s wedding is important! and especially to me! ok? i did not have a graduation party! and i did not go to prom. and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. so i deserve a real celebration and i am not going to let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( she storms out)
(lightly) oh! it ended okay. one of my friends shot him.
yeah, i really do. you know, i had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few
look, i can not have a wedding with this money now. it is tainted.
and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend has not shot
(to the charity guy) we are back!
yeah, because you know what, it is... it is all about the children.
although... it is also about the wedding... ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) no... oh god... oh!
but... but... but we are giving you this!
(looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) well, this is very generous!
oh, is that you?
oooh, i love family traditions like that. when uhm... when ursula and i were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
oh, cool!! wow, it is like a time capsule!
oh, just think... she is going to be watching that video on a tv that has not even been invented yet! with friends who right now are just like babies! and they will be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
yeah! i wrote emma a song.
joey, it is a birthday party.
so you are going to... hit on her?
oh!
or you could stick a fork in an apple!
separate performances.
sure, yeah!
(to joey) are you going to be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
that is right, I have prepared a song for emma. from my heart to hers. for there is no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) emma! your name poses a dilemma. because not much else rhymes with emma! maybe the actor richard crenna, he played the commanding officer in rambo. happy birthday emma!
no, of course not! i also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “sex and the single mother. (pause) finding your g-spot.
and you know, i have a massage client soon.
well, if you are leaving, I am definitely going to go.
oh no! he is not getting away that easy! (phoebe and joey run towards the bathroom and enter)
no, it did not.
joey? how could you just let them leave?
wh.. what? no wait, you do not get to leave! I have got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
well, oh, ok now... only one of us has to stay with emma. ok, and as the person who realized that, i get to go!
no, let us just draw straws.
(visibly excited) yeah!! let us do that!
ok! i want the dolphin!
I am too excited!
go! go!
good job alan!
yeah, see you later!
hey, are ross and rachel back?
oh good, i did not miss the party.
i just felt so bad, missing this. so i just slipped him a little something, you know. as long as I am back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
(pointing at cake) hey, you made it into a bunny.
(yelling at the top of her voice) go, go, go alan! run you, hairy bastard!
okay. (phoebe and rachel join monica and chandler on the altar.) hey mon, why did you tell the guys you were not pregnant?
we found your test in the trash, if you are not pregnant—(she sees rachel shaking her head)—it is because i am.
yes, i…i am with child. (flash) and i did not want to say anything because it is your day; i did not want to steal your thunder.
i can not say.
i can not say because he is famous.
okay, okay. it is james brolin. james brolin is the father of my baby.
what?! well he never said that to me!
how about just the bridemaids?
it is.
oh my god!
so instead you told me monica was pregnant.
sneaky.
uh-hmm.
oh, i know. i could only think of two names, him and ed begley jr. and then i remembered he is gay.
(intrigued) really?!
so, are you ready to talk about it?
now?
okay, we will talk about something else then.
who is the father?!
yeah. that is fine. that is fair. is it tag?
okay, I am sorry. I will stop.
is it ross? it is ross is not it—oh my god, it is joey!
ah-hah! at least we know it is a him.
well, i just got off the phone with my lover, james brolin…
yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. and i said, "james, james brolin, are you sure?" james brolin said…
(shocked) what?! (deadpan) why bother?
calm down. maybe you are not pregnant.
when i got pregnant with the triplets, i took that test like three times just to make sure.
I am-I am just saying, do not freak out until you are a hundred percent sure.
I will run out and get you one.
oh no, she will not tell us.
see? this is why you register.
30 seconds.
it is time.
okay.
umm, it is negative.
it is negative.
here. (gives rachel a tissue.)
no, it is positive.
it is-it is not negative, it is positive.
well yeah, i lied before.
now you know how you really feel about it.
with who?
oh hey you guys, i couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner thursday night instead.
so?
no! it�s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. uch, i get mad at him, but i think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.
oh, rachel!
oh, yay!
alright, okay, so we can all go now. that is fun. hey, you know what? we all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.
(from outside) trick or treat! (it�s obviously halloween eve, the night of her birthday dinner.)
ooh, and treat it is. (monica�s breasts.)
wow, so glad i changed. almost wore my ??? outfit that can�t contain my breasts.
ohh. oh wait! (jis) you guys won�t be late for my dinner, will you?
�kay, see you there. happy humping! (outside meeting chandler.) hey�hey! oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? oh my god, don�t people know, you�re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
you smoked!
(smells at him) chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
are you kidding? the woman has the nose of a bloodhound � and the breasts of a greek goddess.
(embarrassed) i�m going to go. (leaves to stairs)
where is everyone? they�re forty minutes late.
i�m starving. i know we were coming here tonight, i ate nothing all day.
yes, they are expected presently. yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
joseph! (to waiter) thou needn�t worry, they shan�t be long.
one really does have a stick up one�s ass. doesn�t one?
no, you can�t go. no-no-no, i can�t hold this table on my own. if they ask me to move, i cave.
okay, fine, i�ll move. alright, you don�t have to manhandle me. (gets up) where? (he points at a smaller table) okay. thank you. wach.
well, i guess they�re not coming. you want to just order?
tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
both it is, thank you.
you guys are over an hour late. what happened to you two?
and that�s judy over there at the bar with emma?
wher-where have you been?
you guys, we�ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
aw � what?
�s a good toast.
(getting up) oh, for god�s sake, judy, pick up the sock! pick up the sock! pick up the sock! (everybody scared) i�m sorry, was that rude? di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? look, i know, you all have a lot going on, but all i wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. and you are all so late and you didn�t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) well, it�s too late now.
well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) hello?
(returns) okay, that was mike.
mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. huh, nkay, i�m going to take off.
oh, i love you guys too, but mike got off work early. wait. wait, i�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. you know what? i am. bye guys! (waves to the bar) judy! bye.
hey, it is your thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
y'know, for once, i am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).
oh, can i play too? I have never played football, like ever.
yay!!
okay, so how do we decide that?
wait for me! wait for me! wait for me! oh cool, this is my first huddle.
okay, so what do you guys really think of chandler?
yeah.
what is block?
i thought you meant in life.
go! go! go!
oh i got it!! (catches the ball) oh! ew! broken boob! ow!
touchdown!! touchdown!!
well, okay, i made a touchdown. it was my first touchdown. so?
oh my god!
woo-yay!!
i love this game!!
oh my god! you dated someone with a glass eye too?!
all right, no, well i want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we going to beat three boys?
come on mon, let her throw the ball.
okay. oooh! oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
wait-wait-wait-wait! so, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged rachel, then is not the play still going.
is not there a national football league.
umm, this stuffing is amazing. do you think we should bring them some?
what? what happened to the window in the attic?!
i can not believe i still do not know what happened to the window in the attic!
(entering) hey.
ugh, i hate this year!
well okay, it is already february and I have only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
oh that is right!
yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had. y’know, i probably would not have to say spank as much. (monica and ross are shocked.)
oh yeah, like you never called!
okay, i can do that! oh, by the way, i love my office.
oh okay. umm, all right. (picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) hi, this is phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please?
umm, okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
oh okay, well I am sorry to bother you. bye-bye. (hangs up the phone.) yeah you are right, this is easy.
oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
oh.
no. (pause) oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner?
(on phone) hi, this phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please? (listens) earl, thanks. (listens) hi earl, this is phoebe from empire office supplies I would like to talk to you about your toner needs. (she is reading from the script.)
I am hearing what you are saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
may i ask why?
i surely do!
(does not have any luck) umm, is-is that because you are out of toner?
no-no wait-wait! i can not just let you hang up! just please talk to me.
yeah! now, why do you want to kill yourself?
chandler?
no look, i-I am sure that people know you exist!
earl, you are not hearing me! all I am saying is that you are not alone all right? everybody hates the people they work with! (one of her coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she did not mean him.)
wait, what was that? that sounded like someone being nice to you.
all right so earl, let us just forget about the people at the office, okay? there-there is got to be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! what about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
oh sorry, boyfriend!
no, whatever! anything!
yeah, he is got to go.
no! I am not finished yet! do not! do not you dare hang up on me!!!
(to marge) excuse me! can you tell me where i can find earl? he is the supply manager around here.
(goes over to his desk) earl! I am phoebe.
umm, look it, you-you can not kill yourself.
no-no i can not! i can not let you do it!
because it was fate that made me call you today!
no! think about it okay? this is not even my regular job! okay? and my first day on the job, you are my first call! and-and somebody else might have hung up on you, but i would not do that because i know about this stuff. my mom killed herself.
yes.
I am not going to give you tips! look do not you see that this-this…this all came together so that i could stop you from doing this.
no, it is fate!
oh. well umm, okay here is a weird thing. my mother was also a supply manager.
oh my god! so was she! and! get this, okay? your-your name is earl, right? her name was pearl, p-earl.
sure! (thinks.) umm, where are you from?
oh my god! so was she! oh, I have got-I have got goose bumps. (she holds out her arm.)
well, y’know I am wearing layers and it is warm.
but if—no look, okay. these jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! and that says a lot!
y’know, i do not-i do not think it is you. this is a freaky place. (to all) hey! guys! (everyone looks up.) (to earl) oh no, it is you.
hey!
yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. can you believe it?! a year ago i did not even have a family, and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud.
eeeee-(she opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it is a fur coat.)-ohh!! god! (she throws it at joey.)
yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? does not she know me but at all! plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
oh my god! you got off easy! when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
oh, i hate this. everything's changing.
i do not know what I am going to do about this coat.
that might work! (she gives him the coat.)
why?
hey!
so listen, you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium?
he says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm, y'know, bring in the next person i know who dies.
this is fashion?! (grabs the coat from rachel.) okay, so to you, death is fashion?! that is really funny. (she puts the coat on and starts to model it.) here is phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry russia. i mean, you really thing this looks good? (sees herself in the mirror.) because i do.
nooo!!
i think he is right. you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
oh, i know.
all right, i can not sit here anymore. i have to walk places. (she puts on her fur coat.)
well, I have been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. okay, i admit it! i love this coat! okay, i—it is the best thing I have ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley! (she starts to leave but stops and says to monica.) remember phil huntley? he was fine!
are you still mad at us?
oh good! because we have an "I am sorry" song.
(to chandler) you are kind of stepping on the song. (she gets ready to play but is stopped by…)
okay, now you are just taking lines right out of the song!
yes! exactly! and that is why…
okay, let us get some perspective people; it is not like I am wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
oh god, i really missed that fat bastard!
hi emily!
here. (she wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
(to the squirrel) okay, stop tormenting me! this mink! okay, they are mean! and they hate squirrels! and y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! (the squirrel stares at her.) all right, fine, now i get it. (to the clerk.) here. (she hands him her coat.) you take it. (to the squirrel.) are you happy now? I am cold!
(entering) hi guys!
um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!'
or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'.
yeah- no- I am just- it is, i have not worked- it is my bank.
it is nothing, it is just- okay. I am going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement-
- and there is five hundred extra dollars in my account.
yes, because now i have to go down there, and deal with them.
it is not mine, i did not earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing.
okay. okay, let us say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what I would hear, with every step i took? 'not-mine. not-mine. not-mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
okay. I would- just- I would never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt.
oh, i can not believe you! you have been so good, for three years!
oh, no! i- i can not drink this now!
'dear ms. buffay. thank you for calling attention to our error. we have credited your account with five hundred dollars. we are sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you will accept this- (searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' do you believe this?! now i have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
yes, yes! like the man in the shoe!
from the nursery rhyme. 'there was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile, who lived in a shoe, for a... while...'
hey, lizzie.
i brought you alphabet soup.
yes. but i left in the ys. because, y'know, "sometimes y". uh, i also have something else for you. (she searches in her purse.)
no, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
i know.
no, i want you to have it. i do not want it.
oh, that is fine, no.
no. because you need that. no, it is okay, thanks.
okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we are even. okay?
okay.
no, I am fine.
huh!
i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
does, um, anyone want to see?
yeah, because otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
does anyone want the rest of this pop-tart?
sorry. ..y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
and on my way over here, i stepped in gum. ...what is up with the universe?!
wait, wait, I am getting a deja vu...no, I am not.
there it is!
you know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and i just- i- (starts chewing her hair)
did he mention us?
(shouting as he leaves) if you never smoke again I will give you seven thousand dollars!
hey.
what you got?
goodie! thanks. so, how is it living with rachel again? i mean, apart from the great food.
oh my god, rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too.
i do not know. they are so perfect for each other; it is crazy.
i just wish they would realise they should be together.
i know. they should be a family. they should get married and have more children.
you know what? maybe once they start dating, and they see what is out there, they will realise how good they are for each other.
so, what are we going to do? are we just going to go ahead and set them up with people?
yeah. (beat) oh, i know what we can do. we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates, so that they will realise how good they are together.
yeah, you know what the best part of it is? i get to do my "plan-laugh." (a maniacal laugh follows.)
ooh, joey.
hey. I am so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight.
well, it is this guy i used to massage. and by massage, i mean hold down so he would not turn over and flash me.
oh, yeah.
a teacher?
well, ross does. what... you are - you are ruining the plan! joey, you have - you have fixed him up with his perfect woman!
yeah.
how do you even know a woman like that?
joey.
so now what do we do?
what if we do not find him somebody else? we will just tell her the date's off, but we do not tell ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
ooh, so this is great! rachel's going to have a terrible date, ross gets stood up, and then they will realise how good they have it together.
it is not santa's plan. no, it is... (laughs the real "plan-laugh.")
no, i think we killed it.
hello?
hey, rach!
you know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he is stoned.
did he go out for a cigarette?
my dear, sweet rach.
by the time anyone's figured out what we have done, we will be in sunny mexico. (beat) oh, wait, that is the end of a different plan.
now, wait a minute. so, they are going to name their first child joey?
how - how do i get them to name the next one after me?
oh, so they owe me like, three phoebes.
oh my god! look, it is ross and rachel. oh, the plan is working.
do not, do not do the plan-laugh.
oh, yeah, they are falling in love all over again.
oh, they see us! oh, they, they look mad. oh, they figured it out. they are coming this way. run!
mexico!
umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
it is okay to laugh right?
okay. (she laughs harder.)
yum-my!
oh yeah! I would let him check out my kitchen floors.
hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (to larry) wow! you saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she would have to go in there hatless to get it. you can have your own health inspector detective show!
yeah, but then i can be you sidekick vunda.
okay, she would love that! y'know, because you know all the clean places to eat.
okay.
he is so funny! (she imitates what he just did.)
(smiles) show me the badge again.
shiny.
(laughing) you are just nonstop!
why?!
(awed) you have the power to do that?
(excited) shut it down.
oh, i took larry there to eat but it was all violated. so we shut it down!
hey, guys, you know what larry would say? he would say, "see you ladle." (laughs.)
ooh, absolutely!
ooh, i love that place! (thinks about it.) so, no.
enh. sure!
oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! that—this milk is mine. i bought this today, because i was thirsty for milk, y'know. (she takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) okay, let us go!
okay, stop! larry, okay, can not you just be larry and not larry the health inspector guy? y'know i mean it was really exciting at first but now it is like, okay, so where are we going to eat ever?
thank you. (to gunther, who is standing there frozen) okay, go! go! go! (he runs off.) (to larry) now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, i know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
oh, look at these! hey, ben. just do it. (ben starts to cry) oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
i can not, i have to take my grandmother to the vet.
monica, she will kill you. she will kill you like a dog in the street.
woof, woof.
what?
oh, all right. what did i have?
oh, no wonder i do not feel full.
i went shopping with monica all day, and i had a salad.
um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
yes, and then i realized I am against that, and uh, so then we bought some, (sees monica pointing at her chest) uh, boobs.
(monica is yanking on her bra strap) bras! we bought bras! we bought bras.
ben, dinner!
duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. ok. (squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)
i licked my arm, what?
so?
you will not even taste it?
not even if you just pretend that it is milk?
oh, i tasted ben's milk, and ross freaked out.
come on. it does not taste bad.
you guys, um i know that this really does not have anything to do with me, but um i love you guys too. (joins in on the hug.) oh, i really needed that. (goes and sits down.)
wait, wait, wait, wait! (runs over and joins in on the hug again.)
well, i left my guitar here again.
okay. (monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)
oh.
okay.
great! umm…(monica closes the door again and phoebe knocks again.)
so do you want to hang out or something?
oh are you and chandler…
okay. do you guys want me to play for you?
you ask an intriguing question chandler bing.
oh my god! you are getting a massage! you never let me massage you!!
you told me you hate massages!
i can not believe this! how long as this been going on?
oh, it has a name?
okay—oop! too late! I am leaving! come on chandler let us go! (she storms out.)
(entering) hello chandler, lovely day huh? (to monica) you!
why will not you let me massage you?
monica! we lived together for years! I have seen you naked!
I am curious about the human body.
but I am a professional! and I am really good! look, if you are uncomfortable we can stop. just give me a chance, okay. please?
it does! how would you feel if you could not share your cooking? or-or imagine how ross would feel if he could not teach us about dragons.
potato, potaato.
(calling from her room) are you under the sheet?
(in a soothing voice) great, let us begin. (she starts the massage.) how is the pressure?
stating the obvious, but thank you. and it is not weird is it.
that is right, you just enjoy.
(getting uncomfortable) okay.
hey.
no-no, i got that.
okay. okay but you should know though, I have raised my rates to $200 an hour.
i mean $500.
600.
oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
yeah, and it really freaked me out! and after a while i even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
really? there is nothing sexual about this? (sexily) oooh. oo god! ohh. ohhhh. ohh. (some cute guy is watching closely.) (to him) what are you looking at?! (pause) i mean hi.
no, you can not let this stop you from getting massages! no look, i have, i have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
well not clients, lovers. but let us just y’know, try it again. come back and-and we will work through it.
yes.
great! okay, if you will just excuse me. (to the guy) so, did you hear something you liked?
that is it. just relax.
come on more!
yeah, you like that do not you?
you want it there? you take it there baby!
yeah, say my name. say it! (she stops when she realizes what she is doing.) and now I am going to cover you back up, and umm we are never doing this again.
why do not you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’
ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I will go up there, I will tell him to keep it down.
(muffled through the floor) yeah, look i was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and i am sick and tired... (i tired but the rest is unintelligible).
(muffled) oh, thank you.
well, he is very charming.
well, you are just going to have to try.
(to one of his sisters, cookie) hey!
well, i have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
wow. okay, i do not know how to talk to you.
where did you get too? we lost you after you opened up all the presents.
why, what happened?
how can you not know which one?
we did not fool around with any of them. dwha! dwha!
oh well y'know. (laughs)
ick, you were eavesdropping.
oh, I am sorry. but i really like this guy. and i think he really happens to like me.
thanks you guys! thank you.
god, i hope they kick his ass!
hey!
hey!
well, personally i think it is great you are giving yourself a break.
sure. it is just as well... i mean, last year was not very good. i think she is losing her touch.
am i? really? am i? well, why do not you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! well, think about it, think about it, you will be trying to top than you did last year. you would be in competition... with yourself.
hey!
oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
you are not making the pies yourself?
hey rach.
what is emma doing today?
well, i want to enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she is a real dog!
(sarcastic) oh... okay.
okay, oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
well, i was thinking...
yeah!
hey.
we can not leave now! there was this one baby, haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! this competition just blew wide open, folks!
oh, i know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) it is okay. now, the way i see it, our real competition now is cameron. oh my god, they just took her sweater off. look at those arms! hello michelin man.
(panicking) but emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
okay. rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now! i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma!
yeah!
yeah!
good! oh yay! let us get down to business! emma needs some makeup!
well, she is going to look all washed out next to the other contestants!
why not!
oh!
no, we are late!
do not point that thing at me, tribbiani!
uh, we were at the spelling bee!
and it looks like she put makeup on her!
you guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
alright, what are we going to say?
oh, good, that is good, but you do not look like you were mugged!
we are just... we are trying to figure out an excuse. hey! ooh! how about this: we can say that monica told us 5 of the clock, not 4 of the clock. that way we are right on time! (others start to agree but she continues) or... or, we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her.
well, I am not going in first. i bet that vein on monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
oh, really? does it beat water balloon? (she places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).
it is locked.
what are we going to do? I am starving.
oh yeah!
well, i do not know if that is such a good idea. they clearly do not want to be with us.
so bad.
pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with emma's trophy in her hand). here! (gives it to monica).
come on you guys, let us just do our own thanksgiving.
I will pull you through.
I have already stuffed a bunch of brussel sprouts down his pants.
just a sec., we are kind in the middle of something here.
i know. have you considered pageanting?
oh, it is so great to see you feeling like this!
wait, am i missing something though? ‘because i thought death was something that is supposed to be sad, in a way.
wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! when i was kid, i had a barrel.
no, just a barrel.
really?! really?!
(entering) hey!
oh! ooh! oh monica! it is so beautiful.
so, I am here, ready to play.
i brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. ha-ha. (she removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)
that is a dog, every house should have a dog.
well, maybe it is so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
no, no, that is the ghost for the attic.
well, nobody wants a ghost. but you have got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient indian burial ground.
okay, obviously you do not know much about the you.s. government.
(holding a dinosaur) okay, dinosaur attack!! quick, everybody into the house!! ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. she starts to bark like a dog.) roof! rrroof-roof-roof!
okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. come dinosaur, we are not welcome in the house of no imagination.
the little ones do.
hey!
look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
look, look! (she lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)
oh, okay, it is the slide instead of stairs. watch this. (she slides a doll down the slide)
the licorice room, you can eat all the furniture. and, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)
watch, watch. (she turns a strand of christmas lights strung around the house.)
and, and! (she turns on a bubble maker.)
(entering) hey!
what?! oh my... (sees the remains of the house) oh my god!! what happened?!
all right. did everyone get out okay?
ohh. what is this? (she sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)
(she pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) ohh, the-the foster puppets!
hey!
(not amused) ha-ha. (she sits down on the couch.) no, it is just I am so pregnant that i—my guitar does not fit anymore. so i thought ‘til I am not, I am just going to play all my songs on this drum. it sounds really cool!
listen. listen. (she starts to play and sing.) smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
i know! i know, and I have only been playing for like an hour!
hey! what are you doing here?
oh, well, do not tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
wow! that is so great! oh! oh! cougar.
hi!
ugh! no! this is so hard! i went through this whole book (holds up a book) and found nothing! i want a name that is really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? like-like exxon.
no, I am-I am not sure about hulk, but i like the idea of a name starting with "the."
well, i, i like the idea of naming him after someone i love, and joey and chandler are great names. (they both stare at her.) but, all right, i do not—maybe I will just name him the hulk.
god, susan is so fun!
yeah, i definitely. i do not like the name ross.
no! no! i-i meant for the baby!
well, it is just y’know that something like this would never to like the hulk, y’know…
so, i decided I am definitely going to go with either joey or chandler.
well, how about a compromise then, okay? what if it is like y’know, chanoey?
all right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
umm, gene.
bye, gene.
oh my god!
wow, carol really messed you up!
yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. (they all look at her.) all right, so i do not know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
all right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, carol left him and bamn! paranoid city!
yeah. the ’92 ross would not.
drum roll.
you are actually going through with this?
you got problems because of you! not your name! all right, this has got to stop! chandler is a great name! in fact—yes, (to joey) I am, I am sorry. i know you really wanted me to name the baby joey, but eh, so, I am-I am, I am going to, I am going to name the baby chandler.
yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
okay!
yeah!
yay!
yay—oh—yay! okay, i got to go tell frank and alice! right now!
ooh, uh… (she grabs her coat and runs out.)
okay, bye!
ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (joey grimaces)
(softly) sorry. (camera pans back to monica, still on phone)
woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)
oh, paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
well, racquela's right, yeah!
oh, okay, i do not know what you just said, so let us get started.
um, that is really your decision, i mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! you are being naked!
fine!
nothing, I am sorry, I am just, I am out of sorts.
all right, you know paolo?
well, he made a move on me.
well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (a flashback starts paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up phoebe's legs.)
oh yeah, I am sure. (flashback resumes with phoebe doing a voiceover.) and all of a sudden his hands were not the problem anymore. (flashback continues: paolo rolls over, phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)
oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
uma thurman.
she is going to hate me.
hey!
are you moving out?
um, um, rachel can we talk for a sec?
oh! (sits down) ok, um, ok, um,
ok, um, (clears throat) we have not known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. one, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, i never lie, and three, i make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (phoebe opens a tin and offers rachel a cookie)
oh, i do not make them a lot because i do not think it is fair to the other cookies
which proves that i never lie.
paolo made a pass at me.
are you okay?
ok, I have got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) here you go... (rachel drinks straight from thermos) oh!(rachel finishes thermos) better?
I am so embarrassed, I am the one he hit on!
no, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
such a pig!
oh he is like a...
...like a...
yes, good! ok...
(raises hand) oh! i know! (rachel startled) it is because... he is gorgeous, and he is charming, and when he looks at you...
the end.
should i not have told you?
i think she took it pretty well. you know paolo's over there right now, so...
ooh!
oh, ok bye-bye.
oh, just look at her... (girls move toward rachel on the balcony)
you ok?
yep!
okay, so when you are done with your tea I will look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
oh yeah, I have done it for years. i actually stopped because i was so accurate. y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it is-it is wondrous unpredictability. y’know? and also tea tends to give me the trots.
okay. (looks at the leaves.) ooh, i see a ladder. (checks the book) which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
uh-hmm. uh-hmm, who is next?
okay. (reads the leaves) umm, oh! okay, i see a circle.
oh! (checking the book) which can either mean you are having a baby or you are going to make a scientific discovery!
umm… wow, all right. (checks the book.) wow! yay! ooh, I am going to meet a guy! and really soon! and he is going to be the man of my dreams. probably not the guy i had a dream about last night. (points at chandler.)
(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I have been that guy everywhere i go. we take the same bus. we go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he is the tea guy. (he gets up to leave, and smiles at phoebe.)
oh hello.
oh jim, jim nelson I am phoebe, phoebe buffay. we certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
well, maybe we will. (starts to walk away.) oh! (she turns around and the exchange information.)
is not it funny how we kept running into each other? it is as if someone really wants us to be together.
oh, witty banter. well done.
oh okay, well I am a masseuse, and i used to work at this place…
i-i-i like, i like parties.
yeah i guess, a little.
(a little freaked out) so! umm, anyway i-i lived in new york, someone wildly i guess, for umm—well since i was fourteen.
oh stop it.
okay. umm look, you are coming on a little strong. but I am going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. so, why do not we just start over okay? and you can just tell me about yourself.
okay.
what?!
oh my god!
wow! you do?
all right. (gets up and walks out.)
oh there it is.
i know, but that creep that i went on that date with goes to there so i have to find a new one. i also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…
a new grocery store. the universe said i was going to meet a nice guy and that is what they gave me? (looks up) when i get up there I am going to kick some ass.
yeah, we both can. and we both will.
oh, you did not have to come in with me.
okay.
what?
oh yeah well, I am sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
a little. (she turns around and looks up.) (to the universe) now you are talking.
i-i-I would love to. let me just tell my friend.
(looking around) she must have left.
all right, y'know forget hypnosis. the way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
oh my god!!
frank! hi!
what are you doing here?
what happened?
but, also, what happened between you and your mom?
your getting married?!
my little brother’s getting married!!
do i?
yeah, i do, yeah.
yeah, is not it fantastic?
what, he is 18.
yeah, I am a big surprise.
wow, kids. frank, are you sure you are ready for that?
oh good! okay. ‘because you were acting like you did not.
no, i know, i know, that this is frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. y'know, i do not want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it is sick and wrong!
no-no, oh, I am fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it is tongue down my little brother’s throat!
but, i mean, do you think he is going to enjoy it when he is up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! this is not fair to frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it is not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it is not good home economics.
yes. not out loud.
yeah, but if i do tell him, then he is going to hate myself. i mean look at him and his mom, i can not. (pause) but, you guys can, please you got to talk him out of it.
come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, i have everything to lose. do you want me to lose everything? everything?!
okay, I am going to go get frank. (exits)
(to joey) you are frank’s best man?!
well then, (to ross) what about you?! huh?!
hi! oh, alice, hi! thanks. I am so glad you could come, ‘because I have got a real umm, home ec emergency. (points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)
yeah, i know. it is a real mustard-tastrophe. can you help me?
y'know what, forget it. it is ruined.
or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother frank.
okay. whoa, sorry. why were you just like all in the dark?
oh, yeah, sure. so, how was your day?
what umm, what happened?
oh no. did umm, did she say why?
yeah, yeah, no, i do not, i do not know. but, y'know what, maybe it is just all for the best?
oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)
uh, well i can tell you why. it is, it is because of me. but, y'know what, i only did it because i love you. okay?
umm, well i, i kind of had a little chat with alice, and i sort of made her see why you two should not be together, y'know. and you are going to see it to, one day, you really, really will.
okay.
okay, but.
hey, frank. look, okay, i know that you think i did like this totally evil thing, but i so did not. there is someone here who can explain this better than i can.
yeah, but not just that.
none the less.
that is right, exactly. (sees them) all right, it is a good bye kiss, that is good. (frank picks alice up and they move to the couch) bye-bye. (they both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I am saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (they ignore her) okay, I have decided I am going to let this happen! okay, can i just get my purse? (she reaches in and alice moans) okay, all right, good. (leaves).
hi.
breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike!
oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can not think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!! (pause) hey monica, i really need your help getting through this...
well no, when i get to the point where... you know... I am ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... I am going to come to you.
ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never wants to get married and i should not be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I am going to miss him so much. I am going to want to see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
(after a pause) unless... maybe it is too crazy about this... alright so... you know, there is no future... but that does not mean we still can not have fun. you know what? forget what i said.
that was a test and you just failed.
god, i wish mike were here.
i got to call him. just to talk to him, there is no harm in that.
here.
okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to monica)
yes.
yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
you can not have it.
no (tucks it in her pants)
(disbelievingly) oh yeah.
damn you monica geller hyphen bing!
you know, it is a lot less surprising to do that after I have buzzed you into the building.
those are my shoes.
monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but I am actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kind of want to be alone right now.
i ordered chinese food.
what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!?
I am sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him.
there is a speakerphone on the base unit...
not if nothing happens. why can not... why can not we just hang out as friends?
sit down.
thanks, you look good too.
so how is the piano playing going?
I have missed you too.
i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?
what?
oh, i missed you so much! (she kisses mike)
who is this?
joey stuffing 15 oreos in his mouth. (joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)
where were you?
oh, which museum?
(just phoebe) no, answer his.
umm, that paper’s two weeks old.
what is wrong mon?
oh.
hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘quiet, bitch.’
hey! you guys, I am writing a holiday song for everyone. do you want to hear it?
(singing) happy chanukah, monica! may your christmas be snowy, joey! happy new year, chandler and ross. spin the draddle, rachel!
oh, yay!
i know but it is so hard! nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
all good, thanks. (to rachel) do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that is easier to rhyme?
pumpkin? yeah. but did he ever call you like, budolph?
(shocked) you work with robots!!
no! no, the robots just work for them.
if she is no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
hey! ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
(singing) happy, happy chanukah, chandler and monica. very merry…
what?
so! ross does not really decorate his tree with floss, but you do not hear him complaining do you? god! (phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up ross with a start.)
so, did you pick one yet?
well look, you do not really like the one from uptown and you are too exhausted from dating the one up in poughkeepsie, so i say you just end them both. okay? you take a train up to poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. and then by the time you get home tonight, you are done!
umm, well i had a similar problem when i lived in prague.
there is sooo much you do not know.
(singing) "went to the store, sat on santa's lap.
ross, i know what you are thinking.
that she is going to move in with you and maybe then she will fall in love with you and then when she finds out you are already married, she will just be happy. y’know? you are just, you are very sad.
what?!!
no! (ross’s phone rings.)
yeah, professor and mrs.
oh! yeah, y’know you and ross are still married.
just kidding!
(to ross) saved your ass.
hi.
well, you know that psychic i see?
well, she told me that I am going to die this week, so I am kind of bummed about that.
yeah, and i know you guys do not know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
i do not—she said y’know that I would have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black.
no, ‘because she did not tell me i was going to die until the very end of the session, and i was not going to waste a whole another hour there! i mean I have only got a week left, y’know? I have really got to start living now! (so she picks up the latest copy of car and driver (a you.s. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)
oh, this is it. this what is going to kill me.
hey!
ugh, it is so exhausting waiting for death. ohh, by the way, do you think you could—(groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)
i was preparing you for my—did not you think i was dead? did that not come off?
yeah, thanks. and listen, can you do me a favor? could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.
hey!
what is going on?
hey! maybe you will die!
no, we can go together! just do not wait too long though, okay? ‘because I am outta here sometime before friday.
no-no, it will be fun! we can come back and we can haunt these guys!
(entering) hey!
listen to this! my reading was wrong, I am not going die!
because my psychic is dead! she must have read the cards wrong!
eh, better her than me! hey, let us bake cookies!
have you really done this before?
hey!
we are just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.
well it depends.
on how far along he is in the sex change process!
your knuckles are kind of hairy too...
wow! talking about high maintenance
I am a woman!
oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight?
but everybody sings. it is so much fun! last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out
oh! what is the matter? are you scared? you are afraid I am a better singer? you are afraid I am going to beat you at singing?
ok fine! please come and support mike. you do not have to sing.
while drinking...
well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
oh my god.
it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
wow! five-month maternity leave, you are back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
"no time for losers, because we are the champions of the world...!" thank you!
hi hi...oh you have got to sing.
but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
all the time when you are cooking.
yeah you are always singing "yummy yummy yummy, I have got love in my tummy"
ok so is not there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
just pretend they are not even here! it is ok monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you will not see anyone
can you totally see through her shirt ?
every little bit of you!
mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...
oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
yes, she gives the people what they want.
oh? isn�t that funny? i did not see that before, i would not have let her go up again.
hey!
sure!
well, i can not give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
well, it was an accident...you know, it is a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
oh no!you guys are not supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
oh, good!ok, good for you!try to recapture the magic!
and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
(playing guitar and singing) and there is a country called argentinaaaa, it is a place I have never seeeeen. but I am told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. humaaan spleeeeen. oldè!
well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so i am here to entertain!
yeah! it really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! yeah, "you suck" and "shut up and go home".
yeah.
but what?
(pause) ok, say no more.
(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): it was not just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! everyone! it was not just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to monica, showing her dress) classy, uh?
hey!
here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
right, yeah, ok, I will ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
oh, ok. fine, I will just, I will take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
my songs are not good enough for your restaurant?
then what is wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
yeah well, "excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) i can not see it, i can not see it"!
well...it is not about quality.
well at least all my songs do not taste like garlic. yeah, there are other ingredients monica.
ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
what are people having, the garlic martini?
(singing) food here at 'javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'javu' ...will kill you..
you would better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is not going to overuse itself.
why? the only person my playing is bothering is you!
(while monica drags her in the restaurant) get your garlic-peelers off me!
ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) ha!
ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
I am sorry too... (they hug)
yeah! as long as it is free! food here is ridiculously over-p...
(smiling, raising her hand) who is hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you will not hate me?
yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. well, actually, she only did it the one time. but it was pretty weird.
okay, okay, but rachel’s going to be here too, can not i just ask her this stuff?
ohhh, i want to come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but i do not—can not get up.
great! yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
oh, have a great wedding!
oh, hey, chandler i want to hug you too!
oh, and great! you might as well bring me my book, it is on the counter in your apartment.
(laughs) thank you.
thank you. (she pats him on his head.)
oh, do you need a hug? you do not have to bring me anything!
oh. oh.
oh, no. oh, nothing.
okay, i have a wedgie.
so-so, what do you want for lunch?
yeah, i do. what is the matter?
eh, do not be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married…
yeah!
oh. no. no. good! yeah, me neither.
we thought you knew!
yeah, we all know! we talk about it all the time!
oh no, ross does not know anything.
well, because we thought you knew!! it is so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, "hey, you like things clean."
hey!
so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross?
well, i think i can help you get over him.
yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross.
and a small piece of chocolate.
and a glass of tepid water. (she gathers up all of these things.)
uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just did not feel like getting up. okay, I am going to show you a picture of ross. okay? and you are going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws.
okay. umm, before we get started, i just want to say for the record that i love ross, i think he is such a great guy. here. (hands her the picture, rachel grabs it out of her hand.) okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that you are with ross okay and imagine that you are kissing him. and you are-you are running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it is some kind of grease, it is—uck! hah?
okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, let us try some uh, aversion therapy.
okay?
so uh, now look at the picture…
all right, and umm… (she grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.)
okay, how do you feel now?
hello.
hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. and i was going to go over and say ‘hi!’ but then i figured, he does not care if he looks like you.
ohh, they are having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel has not been helpful at all. so, do you miss me?
so you are not homesick yet?
all right, the seven of us miss you.
y’know, me, rachel, the birds, the babies…
ooh, the pizza guy’s here!
yeah. but y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the joey special.
yep! okay, got to go, talk to you later.
yeah?
yeah, it is in the guys’ apartment under the sink. why?
what?! what do you mean you are going to london?
i—rachel, you can not go! ross loves emily!
that is not why you are going! you are going because you hope he is going to say, "yeah, i love you too, rach. forget that british chippy."
no! because he is in love with the british chippy! look, rachel, if you go, you are just going to mess with his head and ruin his wedding! y’know, it is too late! you missed you are chance! I am sorry, i know this must be really hard, it is over.

ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. and i have to warn somebody, alright. so if you do not give me that number then I am going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to new glocken..shire.
hello, hello. ohh, ohh, she knew i could kick her ass.
(looking relieved. she puts down the phone.) oh thank god. oh, you changed your mind. oh, look i know you probably want to be alone, and you do not want to talk about it, that is fine. i just want you to know, i think you are doing the right thing and...
(trying to get up.) wait!! where are you going?! what are you doing?! no!! wait!! (not able to get up.) god!! why am i always pregnant when she does that?!

oh! the yuk! ross, he is doing it again! (points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)
hey.

this is madness. it is madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, do not do it!! ...thank you.
lotsa things.
i think she means (imitates) 'you dance a dance class'. oh, c'mon, c'mon. (they put on some spare shoes)

okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I am with rachel.

(sung)
(sung)
well, c'mon, if it is important enough to discuss while I am playing, then i assume it is important enough for everyone else to hear!
could you speak up please?
okay, we are going to take a short break. (goes over to their table)
david's like, y'know, scientist guy. he is very methodical.
me too! oh! did you ever see an officer and a gentleman?
well, he is kind of like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he is smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just- i just want to be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just?
okay, alright, i have a question, then.
um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
sure.
oh, david, i, i think you are a sweeping sorta fella. i mean, you are a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
oh, yeah, oh, I am sure of it. you should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
oh yeah, right now.
okay, now you are just kind of tidying.
i can hop. (she hops onto the table)
oh, hi max! hey, do you know everybody?
no, no, he has not been around.
minsk?
i know where minsk is.
so when, when do you leave?
hello?
hi.
um, well, max told me about minsk, so (puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! this is so exciting!
oh, you are not going? (fake disappointed voice) oh, why?
so-so you are really not going?
oh do not do that.
oh no no.
oh, but i can not do that-
it is your thing, and-
okay, um, stay.
stay.
getting so good at that! (she hops on)
and then... your face is bloated?
hi, max!
are you alright?
you are going to minsk.
oh, you are so going to minsk. you belong in minsk. you can not stay here just because of me.
oh yes, yes, yes you can. just say, um, 'phoebe, my work is my life and that is what i have to do right now'. and i say 'your work?! your work?! how can you say that?!'. and then you say, um, 'it is tearing me apart, but i have no choice. can not you understand that?'. and i say (hits him) 'no! no! i can not understand that!'.
ooh, sorry. um, and, and then you put your arms around me. and then you put your arms around me. (he does so) and, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you will never forget me.
and then you say that it is almost midnight and you have to go because you do not want to start the new year with me if you can not finish it. (they kiss) I am going to miss you. you scientist guy.
everybody looks so happy. i hate that.
i dunno. i do not feel like kissing anyone tonight.
i do not know. i do not know. i can not lie to him again. oh no i—no! I am just going to press my breasts up against him.
uh-huh, yeah that is right.
what? you mean behind my back?
(gasps) oh god!
oh hey!
(to monica) anyway, i should go. okay, bye.
come on you know what to do! you hire the first one! you do not hire an assistant because they are cute, you hire them because they are qualified.
let us see. (looking at the picture) oh my god! oh… but no! no! you can not-you can not hire him, because that—it is not professional. umm, this is for me (the picture) yes? thanks. (puts it in her pocket.)
hey—ooh, how is hilda? is she working out?
sorry.
what happened?
you! an actor?! that is madness!
hi!
you must be hilda.
oh, you like that? you should hear my phone number.
so you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
but-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
oh! yeah, this is fun, couples night.
wow!
i do, he is been working on that all day! (looking at joey)
hey mon? was it weird changing your name to geller-bing?
where did you go to do it?
thanks! honey, would you want me to take your name?
all right, let us see, call me mrs hannigan.
what? can not you see I am in the middle of something? ooh, i like it.
okay!
good for you. that was really mature.
joey, you can not make someone do something they do not want to do. believe me, there is something I have been trying to get mike to do in bed and there is... he is just...
all right, prude... look, monica and chandler really love this house. you are not going to talk them into staying here.
(to the woman behind her) this place is so depressing. if i had to work here I would kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) but you obviously have not.
i need to change my name, please. see, i need to change it because I am-I am hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) you are fun.
okay, well, i just do not, i do not know how it works exactly. see, my name is buffay and my husband's name is hannigan, so is it supposed to be buffay-hannigan or hannigan-buffay?
well, not anything, i mean...
oh, this could take a while.
okay.
hey!
oh, not anymore. i changed it today.
wrong again! apparently you can change it to anything you want. so i thought, all right, here is an opportunity to be creative. so meet princess consuela banana hammock.
uh! princess consuela.
uh-huh!
uhm, no. I am going to have my friends call me valerie.
what are you, what are you talking about? how did this happen?
ross...
can you?
and to knowing that your career does not mean everything. (rachel mouths "aah")
oh god!
welcome back!
oh, me too!
well, I am no longer phoebe buffay.
yes i did! meet: princess consuela banana hammock! (she smiles from ear to ear)
nope.
yep.
why? it is fun, it is different, no-one else has a name like it.
great, okay, what are you going to change it to?
not amused) mike crap bag?
you are not serious, right?
uhu, uhu, well, then, great. if you love it, i love it.
and i love crap.
thank you, mister bag.
oh hi rita! good! (to mike) oh, rita's a massage client.
(shrugs) er, rita, this is my husband.
yeah.
(without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) okay, i will. (to rita) this is my husband crap bag.
yeah... ogh... okay, fine. you made your point. can you please just be mike hannigan again?
how about uhm... how about buffay-hannigan?
yeah. I am phoebe buffay-hannigan banana hammock.
it is a funny word.
...oh crap!
see, i-i think that one that elton john wrote for, um, that guy on who is the boss.
(singing) hold me close, young tony dan-za.
hi monica!
oh my god, has she slept at all?
oh, okay that explains it. i got a call at two in the morning, but all i could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so i thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. but then i realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
ooh. oh. it looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (ross gives her this look, like 'yeah, does not it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)
maybe, because you told him not to.
yeah, oh, princess leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
um, um. it is huge. yeah, that is the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
oh, yeah, um-mm. oh!
no it is just that i got this new pager and i have it on vibrate. see ya!
rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the princess leia 'do.) oh, hi! where is my strong ross skywalker to come rescue me. (ross stands up horrified) there he is.
( in a soothing voice) relax every muscle in your body. listen to the plinky-plunky music. okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. okay, tell me your happy place.
all right. no, no, no, not a richard thing, just put down the glass. and get out!
well, okay, fine, use my happy place. okay, I am just going to, i have to ask that you do not move anything.
okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
all right, there are no questions in the happy place. okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
all right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I am sure, not permitted in the happy place. okay. just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. and the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
monica, do you want us to take you home?
(walking over and sitting down.) hey.
rachel?
I am, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. so, can i come to bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
oh my god. what happened?
well that is great! congratulations!! (she hugs rachel.)
(hugging her again.) you have lasted a whole year. good for you.
thank you.
now you will not believe this. but, i was in the copy room, making copies, and ralph lauren came in.
yeah a little. he seems really nice. good kisser.
totally.
yeah. i was just in there. he introduced himself and the next thing i know, we are making out. you know.
no!
what am i supposed to do? ask every guy i make out with if he is married? (rachel looks at her.) no, yeah, i should.
hey. here. (hands chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of ralph.) ohh, who is the silver fox?
that is not ralph lauren. sounds like him though.
yeah, no, ralph does not look anything like that guy. he is-he is young and he is got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
what?
why would the copy guy say he was ralph lauren?
ohhh.
hello. oh good. ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (he smiles at her.) oh!! demon!! demon!!
but why did not you just tell her the truth.
well, hey, what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? you know. what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man? huh, did she ever think of that?
just for a second.
well, the only thing you can do. sleep with ralph lauren.
ohh, sleep with kenny.
ohh, yes it would.
(entering and talking on mobile phone) ok, great! all right, bye! (she hangs up) pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) that is off, right?
oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he is going to be there. and she was like "oh, do not worry! i asked him. he is totally ok with seeing you!". so now i have to go so he will think that I am totally ok with seeing him!
exactly!
(after a short pause) i did not even think about that! (pause) aaargh, sexual politics!!
ok, that will be great!
oh, I will take some of that.
no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him because I am going to smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) yeah.
ok. oh good, I am dating a russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets!
(picks up a dress) hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
ok!
so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?
why?
who else?
you like joey?
(whispering) oh my god!
uh, wow! is not it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can not do anything about it, he is already dating her, and she is a nice person, that would not be right.
yeah.
sure!
oh.
any chance charlie has a deaf twin?
well, maybe she did not hear! ok I am going to go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I will talk and see if you can hear me.
(sticks her head out) i did not say anything yet!
(goes back in) I am rachel. it is so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
(comes out too) well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
ooh! we have a problem.
good plan.
oh! I am sorry rachel, i do not have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at "who is more over who"! (at which she walks away)
are you sure? because I am really dreading going to this party.
mike knows I am coming, and if i do not show up he will think it is because of him! and i do not want to lose face! that is a very serious thing in my culture.
you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just do not want to go back to the emergency room.
david?
oh my god! (they hug)
yeah. what-what are you doing here?
what happened?
yeah?
well, it is great that you are back! how are you?
good!
(disappointed) oh, good for you.
mike and i broke up.
really?
i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we are both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that is so not like us!
well... (pause) no.
I would love to.
ok. (they walk away together)
oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
(screaming, angrily) ...dumb, drunken, bitch!!! (applause) (happily) thank you, thanks.
oh my god, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
yeah, i actually do not know...
oh my god! no! shoo! kitty! no! no-no-no! shoo! come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) come on. crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) oh my god.
nothing. nothing.
i just, i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother.
no, no-no, she was a human lady. this is the spirit of my mom lily, the one who killed herself.
no dr. skeptismo! I am sure. first of all, okay, there is the feeling. (chandler shrugs) okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) my mother’s favourite fish is orange roughy... (joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) cats....like....fish! (ross and rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) hi, mommy. (rachel covers her mouth, in an “oh my god.” gesture) oh, i have not seen this smile in 17 years!
(is struggling with the cat) stop it! stop it! she keeps squirming, trying to get away! just like when she was alive.
well, I am not sure. i mean, i guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there is y'know, a new mom. y'know, i think she is worried that y'know, she is going to, she is going to be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) well, that is not going to happen is it? noo. (gets up) okay, i have to return a call in the other room.
well, I am returning a call from a certain mom at the b-e-a-c-h. i just spelled the wrong word. (goes into monica’s room)
(entering, with julio) hi. (sits down in the chair)
yeah?
so great. oh, we took a nap today and my mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
i just feel so, uhh.....
oh yeah, your microwave. the stereo.
yeah? (sees ross) hi!
ohh. um-hmm. but y'know, she choose to find me. i mean, i have to respect her decision. right?
(she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) ross, how many parents have you lost?
okay, then you do not know what it feels like when one of them comes back. do you? i believe this is my mother. even if I am wrong, who cares? just be a friend. okay? be supportive.
okay.
i think she would like that.
thank you. we both forgive you.
yeah, okay, listen, umm, mom, i hope you know you still mean a lot to me. and you are welcome to come back anytime.
come on, mom, I will take you home.
great!
yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
(to rachel) thank you so much for this.
oh my god, it is all so elegant! when is the dirty stuff starting?
you know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
oh, ok. i see what you are doing, that is fine. this is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) hmmmm... raunchy!
really? so this is... this is my big send off in the married life? rachel this is the only bachelorette party I am ever going to have! I have got a big wad of ones in my purse! really? i mean, really? it is just tea?
(excited, running back to her seat) oh!
oh, god!
rachel?
are you kidding?
how old is your phonebook?
oh god no, i do not want to see him take his clothes off!
this is how i look when I am turned on!
shocking!
three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
no, you are not going to pay him, he did not do anything!
i do not care. we are not paying you 300 dollars for this.
oh yeah, okay. I am uptight. yeah, that is why i do not want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what i can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at monica and rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
I am sorry, did you say all man or old man?
you know, it is fine. we will pay you.
or you could teach stripping. you know, share your gift, pass the torch.
there you go. okay, do you think you are going to be okay?
(after a pause) finish it!
your last dance. do it for us.
yeah, yeah. he deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
oh this is so ho-of-ot!
oh no, no, no, do not stop!
hey, what is going on?
(delighted) oh, oh, oh! this is so great! oh my god! this was not at all scary. hi everybody. hi betty! betty, hi! (thrilled) you found betty! oh my god! (hugging people) this is great. everybody i love is in the same room, (still happy) where is joey?
trouble?
oh, no. do not you hate it when people are not there for you?
hey.
um you, you got a minute?
so.
um, oh, i got you a birthday present.
right, like the kind you...
how did you know i was coming?
i can not believe you did this.
i can not believe you... (holding up joey's cardigan) ..did this.
so... what is the deal with umm, you and joey?
does he know?
joey. you know, um, he is really nutsy about you.
you got me.
so, um, are you going to call him?
no, joey.
no. no food with a face.
yeah, you too.
(as ursula) hey.
(as ursula) listen, um...
(as ursula) I am sorry.
(as ursula): yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) you know you, you should just forget about what i said under the bridge, i was talkin' crazy that night, i was so drunk!
(as ursula) that is right, i do not... but i was, i was drunk on you!
(as ursula) okay, yeah, so it is not going to work.
(as ursula) if it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
(as ursula) um, then yes, it is because of phoebe! so, you know, it is either her or me.
(as ursula) you know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) you are going to be really, really hard to get over.
really?
(automatically) yeah. oooh... (she is sprung.)
is he alright?
oh, right! your adoption interview!
what are you going to name the baby?
hey!
oh, that is sarah. no, no. do not you get any ideas, ok? no, I am not setting you up with any more of my friends!
because you will date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
mandy.
no.
fine, I will give you her number.
sarah!
well, you know, if you want fashion help, rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow. you are more than welcome to come with us, right?
hey!
oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night.
yeah! so you are going to call this one back?
what are you talking about? sarah's great!
that is it? that is why you will not go out with her again? so, she took some fries, big deal!
what?
I am sorry, i can not believe i set you up with such a monster!
(to rachel) oh
thank god you are here. listen to this!
joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
what? you know about the plate thing?
(to joey) you would not let her have a grape?
well, i still think that it is a stupid reason not to call someone again. you are calling her! and if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
(to ross) this place is awesome!
wow!
yeah!
what? they will be!
yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got.
oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination?
oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
I am fine, thanks.
nope. (chandler nods in agreement.)
okay. bye!
so, what movie should we see?
what?! really?!
i can not believe this!
no, but it is fast. is not it?
no, i like him a lot but i do not think I am ready for this!
i do not know. I will just handle it—I will ask you to talk to him!
because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him a…man!
hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?
what?!
you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! the one thing! and you can not even do that right! god!
ohh!! god! (gary enters and she sees him) ooh! (to chandler) get out of here, good for nothing.
yeah! okay. (they move to the couch.)
thanks! okay. (they sit down.)
yeah?
uh-hmm.
no that is not true. if you are not moving forward, you are just staying still. and staying still is good. watch this. (she stays still for a brief second.)
yeah?
that is so sweet. but do not you think it is a little too soon? i mean there is so much we do not know about each other.
i just—i do not want us to jump into something we are not ready for.
i really do not want to mess up what we have. I am just—I am worried it is going to be a big mistake.
which is why my answer is yes!
uh-huh! (they hug.) I am so…happy. (she is not happy.)
we are moving in together! is not it great! yay!
i know, I am so excited!
well, you are not more excited than i am! no way! I am the most excited!
okay, yeah, I will see you later! do not forget about the moving in!
i could not tell him no. he got so sad. maybe it will be all right. i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I will save on stamps.
no, i just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. do not they?
oh, I am sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
no, nothing.
yeah.
no, as soon as something opens up we will move right in. unless it does not have a pool, i need a pool. (turns away from him.)
uh-huh!
(sits down) yeah, i feel great. because we are moving in together.
yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (pause) can i get some water?
umm, yeah! today's.
(looks at the paper) are these for rent! i thought people were just bragging!
yes. yes! fine! i am someone! you want me to say it? i have doubts! (pause) I am sorry! (puts her head down.)
yeah?
that is so sweet.
living with you would make me happy.
no, i really want to live with you! i want to move in with you!
yes. definitely! yes! let us live in an apartment that we both live in! (hugs him.)
oh wait, one sec. one sec. (goes to the mirror) hey you! behind the glass! who are you looking at! I have always wanted to say that when i was in one of these rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!
i like waking up with you too. (looks out the window) oh! it is such a beautiful morning. (some birds are singing outside the window) oh, i can stay here all day.
we could have breakfast in bed…
okay. (he grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) oh! oh no.
(entering) oh good, you are all up.
oh yeah, that is over.
he shot a bird!
yeah. yeah, I will be alright.
(catches it) nah, i do not feel like playing. (she sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)
yeah!
(entering, with gary) hey!
monica, I am sorry i did not come by last night. i was out with gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. we saw and prevented crimes.
uh-huh!
(excited) john glenn is here?!
hi!
my god, joey!
yeah! sure! yep! (gets up) oh, y'know what? if i heard a shot right now, I would throw my body on you.
okay!
bye!
yes. once. yeah, a little. he kind of did it to himself. it is not really a good story.
well you all know that I am a pacifist so I am not interested in war in any way. (gets up) but y'know what? when the revolution comes, i will have to destroy you all. (starts to leave.) (to joey) not you joey.
oh my god! (joey looks at her.) I am sorry, too soon. you go.
good for you!
oh my god! that guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
go for it.
I am just saying, get his number just in case. but no chandler is in an accident and can not perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
i did, but that was really fun.
oh hey!
oh, great! we could not keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he would kind of lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (does that to monica.)
(laughs) all i could think of was y’know, "is he going to kiss me? is he going to kiss me?"
I am a lady monica, i do not kiss and tell. but this hickey speaks for itself. (she starts to open up her blouse.)
i just like him so much that i just feel like I have had 10 drinks today and I have only had six.
you sound like a guy.
you will have a last kiss.
okay bye. (they kiss.)
bye! (phoebe goes over and joins monica on the couch.) we said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
(yelling back) i miss you too!!!! (he walks away.)
no. why?
okay, do not sweat it. (looking around her.) chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. that guy’s cute. (points to a guy sitting behind monica.)
no that is the last thing you want to do!
because you are marrying him!
all right, I have never been engaged and I have never really been married, but i can only tell you what my mother told me. whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
that is correct! yes, you are supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
yes!
oh my god! you are right! go! (monica starts to leave.) go tell chandler! hurry before it is too late! wait no! (monica stops.) does this also mean putting out does not get you love? (monica is shocked.)
rach?
oh. (picks it up.) it is just so unexpected! i…i uh…boy I will tell you it is just such an honor to be nominated for a nobel prize and y’know to win one for a massage. especially after having just won a tony award for best actress in…
…in reservations at 8:00 by neil simon. (to an imaginary neil simon) thank-thank you neil. thank you for the words. (blows him a kiss.)
please, do not play the music. just uh one more. live from new york! it is saturday night!!
we were out of doritos.
wow! i cannot believe mark asked you out.
what, so what are you going to tell him?
huh.
wow. so, okay, maybe that means that, you are not over ross yet and you have issues with your father.
okay, so it is probably just the ross thing then.
so, you are like a zillionaire? (pete smiles and nods)
y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
yeah, or, or, or, mississ-pete.
yeah, kind of.
(to chandler) hey! (chandler looks up, startled) why is not it spiderman? y’know like goldman, silverman...
it is not?
oh, okay. there should be gold man!
okay well, he would turn things to gold.
ahh, his work is done.
okay. all right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-draw!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)
now, have you told anyone else?
you told me.
yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. i only wish you had not been on the toilet.
hey! so chandler, want to go to the coffeehouse?
yeah, coffeehouse.
so how are things going with paul?
that is easy! you just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that will not open.
no that is what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
(to rachel) watch this.
hi paul!
so how are things going with you?
yeah! that was so weird, huh?
i did not do it! it was chandler! he is… he is mad at you!
please, i think you know why.
come on ross, you are a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
do you think that is something that he would be mad at you for?
well then i think that is it.
oh, if that is what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
okay, so maybe you do not get her a ring. maybe you-maybe you do something different. y’know? maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? or an engagement tiara? or—ooh! an engagement revolutionary war musket! (picks one up from the display in the corner.
huh? can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
(coming over after returning the musket) wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. okay? i know how to haggle. so let me handle this from here on out.
or not, whatever.
chandler, i-i will handle this! (to the jeweler) how much is it?
we will give you $10.
we stand firm at $10.
okay. (to the jeweler) listen, I am sorry about before. do you have anything her for $10.
I will give you $1 for them.
okay umm, I would also like to try on the tiara. (the male jeweler hands it to her.) oh yeah. okay. (puts it on.) (to the jeweler) what do you think, too much?
okay. then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (he hands it to her and phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) something is missing. it is not… okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
oh my god!! (she runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) no! what?! help me! let me out! now! (points the musket at them.)
chandler, i found the perfect ring. (holding it out for her.)
oh my god chandler, the one you picked is gone. it is over!
some guy bought it. I am sorry. i tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!
the little jail between the doors!
i know, I am sorry! but y’know, this ring is better! monica never even saw the other ring.
maybe it was the guy.
(entering from her room) hey.
it is not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! it is a beautiful ring!
okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘because i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
well you certainly can not give her that stupid gumball ring.
there he is! (points.)
wow! you are good! after this, we should solve crimes.
oh, okay. (walks over to him.) excuse me sir? could you come with me please? you have a phone call.
it is your office.
john?
(to chandler) here he is.
wow! i would trade.
yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?
yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if I am not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…
(entering) hi.
what?
oh i know, i helped pick out the ring.
i did not know playboy prints jokes.
(entering) hey.
wh-wh-what are you doing?
oh, i want to look too! (she runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). yikes!
oh, yeah. aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
rachel.
i do not know. (pause) me neither.
i guess it was kind of funny.
fine. the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that you are … just … kind of high maintenance—okay let us go to lunch!
no, okay, you are right. you are easy-going. you are just not as easy-going as rachel. she is just more flexible and-and mellow. that is all.
ya, you know, rachel … she will do whatever you want. y’know, you can just walk all over her.
oh, okay, (laughing) you are not a pushover.
okay.
that true, i am flaky.
yeah, totally.
that is great. good for you guys.
who said you were?
oh, I am flaky. I will say anything.
really? I have heard better.
(to monica) y’know, suddenly i find you very attractive.
wow! that is a bad audition.
(returning from the bathroom) rach, you are in my seat.
hey, i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
yeah, well, i kind of thought.
hi
oh, he is at the doctor, he did not poop the whole time we were there!
oh, why? what is up?
oui, bien sur je parle français! qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
sure! tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
all right, it seems pretty simple. your first line is "my name is claude", so, just repeat after me. "je m'appelle claude".
well, just... let us try it again.
je m'appelle claude.
uh. it is not... quite what I am saying.
it does, really?
all right, let just try it again. really listen.
(slowly) je m'appelle claude.
oh, mon dieu!
hi!
oh!
ok. what are you going to be doing today?
je m'appelle claude.
noooo! ok, maybe if we just break it down. ok, let us try at one syllable at a time. ok? so repeat after me. "je".
m'ap
pelle
great, ok faster! "je"
m'ap
pelle
je m'appelle!
ok, it is too hard, i can not teach you!
i, i have to go before i put your head through a wall. (she leaves)
hey joey.
listen, i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and, and i know, i was too impatient. so let us try it again.
really, can i hear some of it.
well, you are not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) you are not... you are not... again, you are not speaking french!
how could you possibly think that?
(in a french accent) uh, excuse me. uh, i am reginé philange. i was passing by when i heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my french town of estée lauder.
écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. c'est mon petit frère. il est un peu retardé. (translation: listen, i will tell you the truth. he is my little bother. he is a bit retarded.)
alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (translation: so, would you please just humor him?)
(to the director) merci. au revoir. (translation: thanks, goodbye.)
okay, can you really tapdance?
it is off the resumé. (she strikes it through with a pencil)
archery?
horseback riding?
you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
come on! you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
ready... go!
(checking her watch) you did it!
wow!
no! barry and mindy.
which time?
what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch?
yeah, i had a massage client who worked there and-and he said i had a knack for stocks.
because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought y’know that if I would work with stocks, I would have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
(entering) hey!
what?
ohh that is so sweet! (her cell phone rings.) oh! hang on! (quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) hang onnnnnn!!! (gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (on phone.) go!! no! no-no! i said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it is a number! it comes after 4-9!! no, it is okay. it is okay, you are allowed one mistake. just kidding, you are of course fired.
hi!
hang on! hang on! hang on! (answering the phone.) go!! who is this? (listens) oh okay, you are going to like working for me. what is your name? (listens) what kind of name is brendy? i… whatever… stop talking! all right, from now on your name is joan. you can pick your own last name.
(yelling from monica’s room) no-no!! no!!
no! there-there was a little, a little diff in the market and i lost 13 million dollars.
what am i going to do?! what am i going to do?! i can not call my office they will kill me! i can not call my clients they will kill themselves! great, now my chest hearts.
(louder) my chest hurts! oh, and now i-i can not breathe.
oh, if i were, would-would i have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
then yes that is what I am having. (takes another puff of the cigarette.)
most people do not like their jobs, i love my job! i have not been working for three hours and I am already going crazy. i miss joan.
(to ross) so what is going on with you?
still going through that dry spell with carol?
how long has it been since you had sex?
oh that is not so bad.
that is.
maybe you need to spice things up a little.
i do not know. you could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
y’know, dirty talk, m�nage � trois, toys…
roll playing… you could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. you could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
yeah! or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you are-you are-you are rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! (ross looks at her.) it never happened.
oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
no! it is not a cigarette! the smoke is coming out of me!
okay! okay! (puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I am so glad you are here.
oh, give it to me.
give it!
was it my work? were they mad? was it jack? did he yell?!
thank god.
hey.
well, I have got to get out of this bed, I am going crazy here. crazy!
what the hell is this, herbal tea? i hate herbal tea!
what are you two girls whispering about over there?!
okay, what is this? a stupid contest? because we got a winner here! (points at ross.)
i know! but if i did not work there, what else would i do?
yeah that was lucrative! smart like your brother!
hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do i do?! what will i do?!
i thought I would try to take a walk. would you pour me some water? I will be back soon.
no. I have learned my lesson.
let us go! come on! move it! (grabs her coat.) come on! (to an old man who is holding her shoes and briefcase.) shoes! briefcase! (takes them both.) thanks lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (she leaves.)
surprise! look who is back!
hey!
uh, i do not think so!
jack!! hey!
all better! back to work! except this clown from research told me i was fired. he should do his research, huh?
nu-uh!
oh, okay i did not get that message. so this does not count—anyway, I will be in my office.
that is all right, I will work here. this is goo, next to this plant. (she picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
you are in my office! look, i have made a lot of cash for this company! okay? i am talking big bucks! pesos! yen! rubles! you make one little mistake…
oh, so this is all about money! y’know it is bad enough that—ow! oh, you have got to be kidding!
I am having another heart attack!
I am having another heart attack!! call 9-1-1!!
(to arthur, he is the guy calling 9-1-1) dumbass!
well, they fired me and I am having heart attack.
yeah.
(singing)
because he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it is nice to have a date on valentine's day!
i know i am. that is why i can not wear a digital watch.
oh! you know my friend abby who shaves her head? she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
yeah. so, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. it is valentine's day. it is perfect.
ok. we can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
um, that is ok! (throws it in fire) ok. all right. now we need the semen of a righteous man.
ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) oh, ok.
ok, and i have the, uh receipt for my dinner with nokululu oon ah ah.
see, there you go, the cleansing works!
what are you talking about?!
okay, let us discuss rachel's birthday. i say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it is not a surprise.
okay, great so do you want to do it together?
(entering) hey!
hey rach, you want to get some coffee?
oh good!
oh good.
oh wait, i change my mind! (she slams the door on them.) okay, let us talk about the party! i have so many ideas! (holds up a cocktail napkin.)
oh, look at that.
what happened to the intimate dinner party?
so wow, it looks like you took care of everything. thanks a lot, co-host.
like what?
cups? you are giving me cups?
cups and ice? ooh, i get to be in charge of cups and ice? (thinks of something) all right. fine, okay, i will be in charge of cups and ice!
i got it! mine!
(entering, carrying two garbage bags) hey!
is it okay if i leave this stuff here 'til rachel's birthday party?
umm, cups.
yeah well, that is because monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and monica is going to rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (she goes and opens the door to joey.) oh, hi joey!
(to chandler) check it out! cup hat! (points to her hat.) cup banner! cup chandelier! and the thing that started it all, the cup! (holds up one.)
(following him) and did you notice the ice? (gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) look! we have it all! we have crushed! cubed! and dry! watch! (pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) ahhh! mystical!
(noticing her) oh, look! look! look!
i was in charge of cups.
(to the nurse) hi.
hi, yeah, hi! I am umm, phoebe buffay, and i have babies coming out of me.
not yet. umm, i heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
oh my god!
oh no, none of them are the father. the father is my brother.
oh, okay, umm, hi kids! um, it is me, aunt phoebe. i can not wait to see you. please do not hurt me!
(standing up) okay, so umm, somebody has to call frank and alice. (as she is talking joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) and then my mom wants to know-(notices joey)-joey, what are you doing?!
what?!
oh my god, she is so stupid!
that is easy for you to say, i do not see three kids coming out your vagina!
all right—ooh! oh dead god, save me!
I am having my first contraction!
ooh, it is not bad.
ooh, it is sympathy pains. ohh, that is so sweet!
no-no-no! we have not started yet. where is alice?
oh, okay, I am having another one! this one does not hurt either—ooh, yes it does! ow! ow! ow! ow! ooh! (checks under the blanket.) oh, i was kind of hoping that was it.
umm, sympathy pains. i thought it was really sweet at first, but now i think he is just trying to steal my thunder.
hey.
it is very weird! i do not want some guy down there telling me, I am y'know, dilatedamundo!
(interrupting) what are you doing?!! why are you defending him?! just get me another doctor! one who is not crazy and who is not fonzie!
hi! and you are going into what grade?
(interrupting) uh-huh, me too. ross, maybe i should have specified that I would be needing a grown up doctor.
shh! doogie, shh! does not anybody understand that I am going to be having babies soon? huh? go! go little boy, go!
they are. why?
happy birthday!
i know, it is.
can i tell you a little secret?
i want to keep one. (giggles in excitement.)
why not?! maybe i can, you do not know!
maybe not! y'know? seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they are y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. listen, i-i hate to miss an opportunity just because i did not ask! y'know?
oh, just ask him!
i can not ask him! do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! all I am saying is just talk to frank. okay? just, y'know, feel him out!
you are right.
tell him it is for you.
(to rachel) so did you ask him?
well, I am kind of on a clock here.
undo it. undo it. undo it.
hi!
okay, doctor says any minute now.
sorry frank, I am kind of in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
oo, this is a big one. eww! arghhhh!!
what is that?
oh my god!
i already had a baby. leave me alone.
which one do you have?
but umm, i mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…
oh. it was a long shot. hey, you guys can i just like have a second alone with the babies.
so, here you are. it seems like yesterday i was talking to you in that little petri dish. everyone said labor was the hardest thing I would ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. oh, i had the most fun with you guys! i wish i could take you home and see you everyday. okay, I will settle for being your favorite aunt. i know alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. okay, so we are cool. yeah, we are going to be great. little high fives! (imitates the high fives.) ahh! ahh! ahh! (one of the babies begins to cry.) well, if you are going to cry. (she starts crying.)
i know.
yeah. you will not be able to take it.
they are going to call her chandler.
works on you.
oh, hey, mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
well, it is just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
personal shopping? what is that? like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
that sounds great!
hey!
ooh! how was kathy’s play?
that is a good idea for a business!
hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood.
oh-okay, i get the game now.
oh. (joey flips the pancake and phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)
rachel has a new doll.
ooh, what do i smell?
ooh! (they all go over to her apartment)
what? what?
(getting up) well, i hate to eat and run, but…
yeah, i do not need it.
well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
if you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here!
oh, are we going to trash that place?
wait a minute.
why do not you ask him out?
he just got a divorce right?
so he is probably really nervous around women, y'know? maybe, you just have to make the first move.
(shocked) you have never asked a guy out?!!
thousands of times!! that does not make me sound too good does it?
oh, please!
I have never done that.
no, sorry.
great!
oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?
oh good!
how? how is your fault?
(angrily) that is like the tenth time I have peed since I have been here!
yeah, oh I am sorry, it must be really hard to hear! i tell ya, it is a lot easier having three babies play bringing in the noise, bringing in da funk on your bladder! I am so sick of being pregnant! the only happiness i get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘because—oh! I am pregnant!
(starting to cry) thank you so much.
i have not really had any yet.
(to her babies) stop it!
one of the babies is kicking.
it is not kicking me, it is kicking one of the other babies. oh (looks down her dress)! do not make me come in there!
hey!! get your ass back here, tribbiani!! (joey walks back in, scared.)
i can not believe I am going to have a party! this is so great! (really excited) a party! (really, really excited) yay!! (suddenly, she starts crying and rachel moves to comfort her.) i do not know why.
what the hell is this?! what, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that i can not use for another two months?! this sucks! all right, what is my next present?!
hi, guys.
i-i wanted to apologise if i—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. y’know it is just the hormones, y’know.
anyway, i just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (she goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that phoebe is about to attack them.)
good. y’know—no-no, okay, it is-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what is happening with you?
oh!
wow! this reminds me of the time when i was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him.
well, let us see, it is not. really, like that. because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
alrighty, here come the water works. (rachel starts crying harder.)
(sips it) it is so good. (monica and rachel breath a sigh of relief.) oh, thanks.
(sets the cup down) oh! (grabs her stomach in pain.)
oh! no, i-i think i just had a contraction.
yeah, i thought i had one a couple of minutes ago, and now i know that was definitely one.
no. it is all right; it is probably false labour. they said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
well, do you see any babies?
okay, i guess. i mean… i do not know, it is just, i guess i know it is going to be over soon.
i know. it is just y’know usually when you are, when you are done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I am going to be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
okay that is even sadder. look, i know, i know what i got myself into, it is just that now that they are in me it is like, it is like i know them y’know, i mean-i mean, it is just not going to be easy when these little babies have to go away.
yeah, okay.
cool aunt phoebe. i am pretty cool!
they are going to love me.
thanks you guys! again.
you are the best. thanks. oh!
just kidding. ahh!
got cha again, you guys are so easy.
(on the phone, in new york) uh, hello, this is ross geller’s personal physician, dr. philange.
yeah, I have discovered that ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
no, not phoebe, dr. philange. oh no! you have it too!
hello?
hi, so what happened?
yeah, i know, but i do not think that means anything.
hey!
(to joey) you ate meat! (joey is shocked) (to chandler and monica) you had sex! (they are shocked.)
i know you did not, i was talking about monica.
this pregnancy is throwing me all off.
oh, me too!
oh right, maybe I will just go home.
hey you guys! chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
never mind. but it was going to be really good.
so was it a lot more money?
oooh! i have something you can do! i have this new massage client... steve? (pause) anyway, he is opening up a restaurant and he is looking for a head chef.
hi! (turns back to chandler, then to monica) oh, yeah, no, i know. you are a chef. i know, and i thought of you first, but um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
(to monica's tapping) yeah, yeah!
well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he is looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
yeah, i know! (turns to chandler) so, what do you think?
ok. (pause) oh monica! guess what!
where are you going, mr. suity-man?
ooh! brian's song!
(as though rachel was not paying attention) yummy noises.
ooh! i know what you could make! (runs over to join monica and rachel in the kitchen) i know! oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (monica does not know.) you know, that thing... with the stuff...? ok, i do not know. (sits down)
oh, is this the bug lady?
that is so great! because you already know how to do that!
ten dollars an hour for what?
(excited) wow! it is huge! it is so much bigger than the cubicle. oh, this is a cube.
oh! you have a window!
oh look! that guy's peeing!
(sitting) ok.
(overemphasizing) mmmmmm! everything smells so delicious! you know, i can not remember a time i smelt such a delicious combination of (monica signals her to stop) of, ok, smells.
(whispers) in the cab, on the way over, steve blazed up a doobie.
smoked a joint? you know, lit a bone? weed? hemp? ganja?
yeah! you know all those yummy noises? i was not faking.
you guys want to try and catch a late movie or something?
how is this? (presses down hard)
sorry. how about over here? (presses down hard again)
see, that just means it is working. does this hurt? (presses down elsewhere)
what about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)
there you go! (she continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)
oh! joey uh, were you in our room last night?
hey!
are you going to open the presents without chandler?
a little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
ohhh! my god! for tiny salt!
oh yeah.
okay.
well i guess it is okay to open one more if it is part of a set. y’know, it is probably this one. (grabs another small one.)
yeah that is right chandler does still think I am pregnant. he has not asked me how I am feeling or offered to carry my bags. boy, i feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (monica looks at her.) after you of course.
ooh, is it someone in this building? is it that tall guy from the first floor?
what?! i think he is cute.
believe me I am trying.
yeah. you are just going to knock on his door and change his life forever. you are like ed mcmahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
pretty big? it is huge! god, this guy does not have a clue! he is just walking down the street thinking, ‘i had sex with rachel green. i rock!’ then bam! he is a father and everything’s different.
okay. then he still has this huge decision to make. now he is walking around thinking, ‘do i want to be a dad?’ and then bam!
i do not. he got…he-he-he-he is hit by a bus.
oh yeah. that is me.
yes. yes i am. oh my god, I am going to have a baby! (joey and phoebe hug.)
you do not know him. it is not important. he wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (she sits down like she is pregnant.)
david lynn.
oh some guy from my gym. a little annoying.
hey! ooh, did you do it yet?
oh, well what are you doing here? are you about to do it? (gasps) is it gunther?
thank god, ‘because that hair on a baby…
why not?
bus?
well-well but it is huge.
you are thinking about this way too much. just tell him and get it over with. it is like, it is like ripping off this band-aid. (on her arm) quick and painless, watch. (rips it off.) oh mother of…see?
(entering) hey.
all right. (she sits down like she is pregnant again.)
hell yeah! I will marry you! (she grabs the ring and puts it on.)
hey lady, your day’s over! it is my turn!
i can and i will! (kisses him.)
hey!
it is joey! (joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘i love you’ to him.)
we do not know.
who? who is it?
was that story over?
(gasps) oh my god! i know who the father is… (she walks into monica and chandler’s.)
look, i feel really bad about how i freaked you out before, so i called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. go!
i may play the fool at times, but I am a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that will not quit. (she takes the sweater out of her purse.) i believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
uh-huh. now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the band-aid off. what to you want to do?
really? are you sure?
okay, sorry. yeah. (they go inside to confront the father.)
rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, i believe that this is your red sweater.
oh no. could i get anyone a coffee or…poison? no? just for me? okay. (walks away.)
what?!!
no!!
i can not say that did not hurt. but I will take you back joey tribbiani.
ooh! a salami buddy!
wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
always.
what?!
(running out) wait! wait! hi! listen, ross can i just talk to you for just a second?
oh, there is a cab! taxi!! (the cab stops and she opens the door.) good timing, my god, huh? here you go. (pushes rachel in and closes the door.)
oh, the angelica!! go! go! (she bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (to ross) you did not get the annulment?!!
ross?!
do not be worried about that! your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! it could say, ross geller, good at marriage! y’know? mine’s going to say phoebe buffay, buried alive.
so okay what? you are going to be married to a girl who does not even know about it?!—op, woman! sorry.
rachel is one of my closest friends. (pause) although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. okay!
hey rach!
sorry, mix up. hey, how was the movie?
well then you would better hurry! the angelica! go! go! (bangs on the roof again and off they go.)
hey!
no, why?
(gasps) you are pregnant!
ooh! that is good! wow! but now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? hint: phoebe.
guys, I am happy too.
wow! big day huh? people moving in, people getting annulled… (winks at ross.)
hmm, something bad to tell rachel… bad news for rachel, what could that be?!
ross, it is not that big a deal! so you will been divorced three times, you will still have a life, you will go on dates…
ross, you are being ridiculous! okay? you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
y’know that is really fair. y’know? most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. ross, nobody cares about this except you! this-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! here, I will show you! come here.
(to the girls) hi! hi! listen, my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but would not you date him?
okay, so what do you think ladies? who would not be interested? who would not want to date him?
okay, what about you? (points to karin) would not you want a date?
(interrupting) whatever! what about you meg?
(leaning to him) she said, "he is obviously still in love with this rachel girl." (he glares at her.)
well, i thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!!
yes, and now he is using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. i must say, "well done!" bravo meg.
(to joey and chandler) okay, bye!
so? did you get the annulment?
i knew it! because you love rachel.
yeah, complicated ‘because of the love.
I have never been more convinced of your love for her.
oh we do, but not just yet.
okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it will not work out.
i know. then, I am going to marry chandler for the money and you will marry rachel and have the beautiful kids.
but then we ditch those two and that is when we get married. we will have chandler’s money and rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel’s drinking problem.
i do not want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and i kill him.
hey will you get me tickets too?
you do not want to win the lottery?
(excited)hey you guys! ok, you are not going to believe this! i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely going to win the lottery tonight!
oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it is really not fair either! you know, just because we do not eat the meat does not mean we do not like to play with the carcasses!
i hope i win!
one, two, three!
get a room!
oooh, i like that, "daddy" (in a sexy tone)
(still in sexy tone) oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy going to spank me?
ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.
oh, you guys! we have got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from ross and puts it on the table)
(she takes the bowl from rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) ooooohhhhh!
(keeping on running and yelling) ooooohhhhh! (she stops) fine, i can not take it anymore! I am putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)
if we are not doing it together, we are not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets! (she holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).
do not come any closer!
no, what is more important, your friends or money?
hey monica, what about your extra tickets?
ok, good! (pause) you guys were so scared! there was no way i was going to dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) oh god, no! (pause) i think i broke your bowl.
what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun.
so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i was going to win, remember?
as a matter of fact she said that is how i am going to die. (pause ) so, excuse me for being a little skittish.
well, i bet that was very hard for him to do.
guys, the drawing is about to start!
I am still looking through mine...
you guys, what was the powerball number again?
we won.
we won!
do not tear it.
i know that, but look, we have got the powerball number, we have won 3 dollars!
(still very excited) i do not care, I have never won anything before, i can not believe this!
it is not all mine. we all get 50 cents.
i beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).
(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the "pigeon voice" from before) coo, again. do not blame the pretty lady. it was not her fault. it was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) seriously, stop staring at her.
you have got to get out of here! save yourself!
do not worry about me, I am a robot! I am just a machine!!
(she stops reading from the script) oh my god.
i am extremely talented!
(interrupting) no, i mean i was really acting my ass off.
oh yeah, you are solid. yeah, you are just no me.
(tremendously overacting) fine! I will do it without you! (joey gives her thumbs up) i do not need you or anybody else! I am going to make it on my own! (joey closes the door to his bedroom.) you will see!! you will all see!!
i am.
(overacting with a song this time) (singing) gooood luck! gooood luck! we all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
 well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... (the flashback shows paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)
 and all of the sudden his hands were not the problem anymore. (the flashback shows paulo rolling over and showing phoebe his equipment.)
 oh, boy scouts could have camped under it!
 it is not that bad.
 chandler, chandler.
oh!  all right.  now, let us not do this!
happy thoughts!  happy thoughts!
ok, now I am going to kick some ass.
i know!  i know!  i know!
alright, now i will let go if you both stop.
there we go.you know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
(overacting badly) i can not! my circuits are fried! they are fried i tell you!!
i thought you were excellent! in fact for a minute there i was like, "ooh, where did ross go?"
yeah?
(to ross) he is holding us back.
okay!
okayyyyy, open up!
yeah, it is for our catering business!
no, we are going to paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
and also, we do not know what to do with this. (she turns on a switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)
oh sure, cilantro larry.
how could you say yes, what about our catering business?
oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—yay! (monica looks confused) that was me hopping on board.
wow! okay, dude alert! and who is this guy?
ohh! oh, the chelsea reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
oh, okay! (reading) "would i go back to allesandro’s? sure, but I would have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." (to monica) wow! you really laid into this place.
ooh, i got to go. i found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
no-no, it is okay. but are we sure we do not want the waterbed?
yeah, all right. (starts to leave)
bye!
(on intercom) hey, do you need to get in? here you go.
hey, monica!
(entering) hey!
yeah.
i do not know, it would totally depend on her coloring and… (realizes) you got the job!!
okay, is this the day of good news or what? i got us a job! the wedding reception.
but we have only had one job.
yeah! what are you saying?
what?
you are the cook! with out you it is just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!
for what? i can not believe this! i got to get out of here. (leaves)
okay, I am hearing.
what?!
i wa-i wa-i wa…
monica!
no.
no.
really?! are you sure?
oh! it will be fun! ohh! yay! oh! okay, ooh, let us plan the wedding reception. (she grabs the notebook which monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) wow! you really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) y’know what, i want you to take the chef job.
yeah. that is what you really want. yeah, i do not want to be the reason you are unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and i really do not want to be the reason I am unhappy.
besides, it might be kind of fun to form the new a-team.
what is a movement class?
oh my god! how bad was it?
coming through! (has to dodge a fireman) oh! coming through! (sees a cute one.) oh! hello! hi! (smiles then realizes) no! right! coming through!
oh!
oh, it is bad. it is really bad. the only thing in there that is not burned is an ass. which i do not remember buying!
no, not usually. but yeah, i could use one right now.
yes! i do! all the time! i love them! oh my god! i did it! it is me! it is me! i burned down the house! i burned down the house!
well, since the fire was kind of my fault i guess (to rachel) you should get to stay here.
well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
what is that smell?
so did you sleep well last night?
yeah?
y’know what joey left on my pillow?
gum!
yeah i know, it was my candle. my candle!
i do not use a curling iron.
thanks monica!
what the smell from joey’s? no, i can hardly smell it over here.
i can smell it a little, bake the pie.
okay.
oh! (takes the phone.) hello? (listens) yeah this is phoebe. (listens) really?!
well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
oh that is all right. I am still full from your homemade potato chips.
okay. (reaches for one.)
(gritting her teeth) okay, I will be out in a second.
that does not lock does it?
(entering) hey! hi!
(to rachel) listen umm, yeah okay, i need to talk to you!
now i know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but i think I am partly at fault. you see, i did not, i did not tell you but umm, but i-i had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let us just face it, that is just kindling! so i think it is better that i stay at joey’s.
okay. oh umm, chandler, monica is looking for you.
yeah she said something about crumbies.
(to rachel) okay, you have to switch with me! monica is driving me crazy!
no but at monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
all right fine! this looks like so much fun. (examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)
god, what a mess. (she grabs the bowl and heads for monica’s.)
i started that!
oh i know, I have been there. i remember toward the end…
or you can do volunteer work.
joey, you pick who ever you want. okay? you just listen to your heart. what does it tell you? (mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) phoebe, phoebe.
(still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) phoebe-phoebe-phoebe-phoebe—burrrrr! (mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)
mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
when she comes out, you hold her nose, I will blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
i do not know. i-i think it is still going to be a while.
you are on!
one hundred thousand dollars!
fine! I will call zurich and move some money around.
no one’s here! (monica looks at her.) oh damnit!
oh hey mon? rach is here! ohh, you are still pregnant. oh, I am sorry. i know how uncomfortable you are. y’know what? you look great. yeah, like fifty bucks.
it is interesting that you lost. now, i forget, do you like to lose?
fine! you are on!
until then, general grant, why do not you set up camp (she puts the bill in her bra) right there.
good god man do not anger it.
oh i-i do not know about that. no, i think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
thank you!
okay.
is rachel having the baby?
they are at the coffeehouse.
we know it is a girl! (exits.)
(entering) hey!
i have to tell you this story. okay, i was coming over here and this driver…
what?
oh. ha-ha-ha. all right, anyway…
yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—i do not want to talk about it.
so you still had not heard from emily?
london is stupid! stupid!
oh… no, i did that for someone once and I am not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone is life.
(entering) hey!
(grabs the pictures) oh! here we all are! yeah, there is ross and joey and you and me. (she picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. monica can not watch.)
no. I am sorry. it is just because i could not be there. because all i ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
well, it felt french.
yeah?
yeah?
ohh, that is so nice! how great! well, where? where is the trip?!
(excited) central…(not so excited) park!
that sucks! that is not a trip! i just came from the park! what are we going to high five about at the stupid central park? "well, it is right by my house, all right!"
that is fine, just do not bring it in my mouth.
okay, woo! hi.
ooh, atlantic city! oh, that is a great plan! who is plan was that?
okay! ooh-ahh, I am going to go pack. I am going to go pack my ass off!
atlantic city, baby! let us roll some bones! hey joey, high-five for rolling bones!
all right. well, do not worry, i call shotgun! (she starts out the door.)
wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (they all high-five again.)
oh-ho yeah! a song with rhyming words. oo, i never thought of that before.
(to chandler) why? because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she is done.
oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.
hey leslie, how did you know I would be here?
actually i said she abandoned me to write jingles.
hmm, bummer.
no. but thanks.
okay. no. but thanks.
well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. once you, once you betray me, i become like the ice woman, y’know. very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to monica) can i have a tissue, please?
where is chandler?
oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)
yeah, that was leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. that is the twentieth time today! and good luck leslie!
well, yeah. y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our moms worked on the barge together.
you never run on a barge!
oh my god!! you threw pepper on the fire!
it is just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she has not called. not that i even care, y'know.
you think you know me so well.
yeah.
that is what i said.
i can not. i can not. she dumped me, i mean i totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘okay, bye pheebs’ gone. y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I have ever had in like all my lives.
(singing) i stepped in something icky.
(singing) smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? smelly cat, smelly cat, it is not your fault.
oh, yeah!
i..., a jingle? no, no-no-no, no.
okay, well if i was in this for the money, I would be a millionaire by now, y'know. you just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
that is okay. all right, I am going to play song that is really, really sad. it is called magician box mix up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)
(to leslie) oh, i thought you were not coming. what? where were you?
okay, do not give me a reason to get mad, okay
no, look, i told you that i did not want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. god, y'know what, i think five years ago i probably would have done anything to play with you but, i can do it by myself. and if i can not trust you then just forget it.
okay y'know what you have to choose. all right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have smelly cat, but we will not be partners. so what is it going to be?
yeah. i actually am, yeah. y'know life-life’s going to had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. want to hear a new song?
okay. (singing) ‘jingle bitch screwed me over! go to hell jingle who are! go to hell go to hell. go to hell-hell-hell.’ that is all i have so far.
oh hey ross oh I am so glad someone is here could you zip me up?
thank you. can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
oh umm mike's picking me up for a date.
oh i dunno i dunno, you know i mean i like him but am i ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
i would not say never, you know there is that guy (pause) well what about (pause) ok well there is got to be someone.
oh my god you are right.
i can not believe i never realized this before, I am in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god (starts crying) what is wrong with me.
i want to get married (grabs a tissue)
least you have been married, oh my god! i want to trade lives with ross (cries more)
nothing, I am excited about our date, mike this is ross geller this is mike haaaaa (starts crying)
uh huh (terns to ross) how do i look (all her make up has gone everywhere)
(goes to cry) no
well it was awful every time i thought about what you said i started crying.
would you call this girl? (puts on a crying act) thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
it is open.
hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay! (she dances around with happiness)
what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross!
what!
what! why?
(walks towards ross) if you had not just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
I am not going along with some lie you made ross, no I am just going to be honest with him.
yeah I have nothing to be ashamed of ok so i have not been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i have not had a real boyfriend you know if he can not handle that he can leave. which he will and that is ok. so I will just be alone forever you know alright I will be. it will be fine. it will be fine. I will go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)
ok
uh huh yeah (stands up) there is just something umm, there is something you should know (pause) vicrum just called.
.and i said vicrum you can not just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel.
yeah well (pause) yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee.
i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
oh.
ok i can not do this.
well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have been in a long-term relationship, I have never lived with a guy, and I have never even celebrated an anniversary so. (pause) if that is too weird for you and you want to leave i totally understand. in fact I will close my eye's make it less awkward (she sits with her eyes closed and mike kisses her, phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) you kissed me.
so you do not think I am a total freak
i guess so, can i. can i think it is cool that you kiss me and also want to kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. your in your thirty's and you have never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it does not tern into anything serious.
oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. y'know? like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
oops!
thanks. okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
is not he great?
i know, i know. so sweet... and so complicated. and for a shrink, he is not too shrinky, y'know?
oh, i do not know, i do not know. i think that is a little weird, y'know? vinyl.
yeah, because hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
oh, this is my friend roger.
(intercom) it is phoebe.
is not he good?
oh, okay. feel better, rachel, 'kay?
oh, okay. listen, thanks for everything, mon.
hey.
good. oh oh! roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
so what is going on?
uh-huh. okay. okay, do not you think, maybe, though, it is just that he is so perceptive that it freaks you out?
nothing, nothing.
it is, i mean, it is nothing, I am fine. it is my friends. they-they have a liking problem with you. in that, um, they do not.
but they do not see all the wonderfulness that i see. they do not see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. they just think you are a little...
intense and creepy.
but i do not. me, phoebe.
you are not? see, that is why you are so great!
(entering) hey.
oh, okay, except i broke up with roger.
yeah, right.
i do not know, i mean, he is a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways i think he is so right for me, it is just... i hate that guy!
hey, joey. what is going on?
hey!
you guys you really should get rid of those animals. they should not be living in an apartment.
all right. I am going to go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I am ready to have frank and alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
oh, they are just going to umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
okay everyone, think thick.
hi! wish me luck!
oh! i knew it! i knew it! i felt really thick this morning.
embryossss? as in, "more than one?"
five? okay, where am i giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
that is it! 25 percent? that means that is it is like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
okay, well y’know what, do not worry you guys, ‘because I am-I am going to do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
whoa!! that—okay, that is a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to dr. zane) so, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that i can do y’know just to like help make sure i get pregnant?
wow! you guys really do not know anything!
hello, tiny embryos. well, I am-I am phoebe buffay, hi! I am-I am-I am hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. you should know, that we are doing this for frank and alice, who you know, you have been there! umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. okay, and-and i promise that I will keep you safe and warm until you are ready to have them take you home, so… oh! and also, umm next time you see me, I am screaming, do not worry, that is what is supposed to happen.
uh-huh. (to the embryos) good luck.
(entering) hey!
umm, yeah, uh-huh, they are implanted.
well, freaked. ‘because it turns out that the odds are really sucky. and! this is frank and alice’s like only shot. like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
all right, I am going to go take a pregnancy test, right now.
well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than western medicine.
nope, not knocked up yet.
yeah, all right. meanwhile, I am going to do whatever i can to help this so, I am just going to y’know, lie it your chair, (she climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) y'know? yeah, good, I am let gravity y’know, do its jobs.
(singing) "are you in there little fetus?
oh. oh.
all right, i will. no, i will. but umm, y’know just remember that it is still really early, okay so, if it says that I am not pregnant, that does not mean that I am not going to get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so i do not go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
great. (goes to take the test.)
you guys! you guys! you are going to have a baby! they are going to have a baby!
okay, but this can not be good for the baby.
thank you.
(entering) oh.
(in a nasally voice, from her cold) but I am unemployed, my music is all i really have now. well music, and making my own shoes. (she puts her shoe on the table, and it is horribly decorated) pretty, huh? (sneezes)
before i start, i just want to say that umm, i have a cold, so if i sneeze in the middle of song, it is not on purpose. oh, except the last verse of pepper people. (starts to sing) smelly cat, smelly cat. what are they feeding you? (stops singing) this chick sounds good. (singing) smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) hey gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
(singing, drunk) my sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! thanks for the lights honey.
it is fun, god i love how sexy i am. (coughs really loudly.)
well, i think it is great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
yes, you do. chandler loves kathy.
so, i need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
uh-huh. oh, yeah, i could write about the time my hair did that "woo-hoo" thing.
hey.
hi.
wow, cute one!
yeah, i should go to, `because I am playing in one hour. hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. ooh, (tries to sing) my sticky shoes--eww! eww! i lost my sexy phlegm!
okay, i want to be sexy again so I am trying to catch a cold. it should be easy, supposedly they are pretty common.
what?!
well, how-how-how is that possible? you barely know her!
you mean you stole it! (monica sneezes again) do not cover your mouth when you do that!
(entering) hi! it is me. and soup. (to rachel) hey, i just saw josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
(to monica) here, now i do not eat chicken, so it is just noodle soup. and there is no chicken in the broth either, so it is really just... noodle water.
(picking up monica's used kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) sure.
but, i need your germs! i want my cold back! i miss my sexy voice.
it is okay. how is the soup?
(singing) platting goats are platting. platting down the street. platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to gunther) does it even work without my sexy voice?
gunther, kiss me.
(singing) and I am still waiting for my paper mache man. thank you my babies.
oh, look, he is got ross's haircut!
wow, ooh, you are going to be making money hand over fist!
we have got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... (hands meat to monica)
so how are things going with you two? is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?
hey.
how long did you think this barbecue was going to last?
jeez, you say one thing, and...
oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
hi, ben. I am your father. i am... the head. aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees ross staring at her) alright, this barbecue is going to be very fun.
oh, well, see, there is this guy she met at the...
so you do know who he is! (laughs, ross stares at her) sorry.
oh, hey, y'know what? tell them that bone story.
oh, it is dr. seuss!
remembered what?
oh, it is so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune.
i know. this is really, really huge.
nuh-uh. i do not think any of our lives are ever going to be the same ever again.
here, look, alright, does this help?
yeah, but, y'know, it is... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
no, i mean, i mean, when you are at the fifteenth date, y'know, you are already in a very relationshippy place. y'know, it is... you are committed.
well, i mean, then what happens if it does not work out?
maybe there is someone else.
all right, so, so you went to pete’s...
so monica, what were you going to tell us?
no-no-no oh, keep your name, do not take his name.
well then definately do not take his name.
(intrigued) oh?!
(disappointed) oh.
yeesh, what did you do about it?
umm, hey rach, can i ask you something?
okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if i set ross up on a date?
umm, my friend, bonnie. she just always thought ross was really cute, and now that you two are not together, she asked if i could set it up, but if you are not cool with it...
you remember her from my birthday party two years ago. she is yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
great! okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps rachel on the butt)
um-hmm. oh wait! this is bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
(to bonnie) well i hope you have fun tonight.
yeah, she was bald, she is not now.
i do not know, i hardly ever say that about people.
well I am sorry, i thought you said it was okay.
well, maybe it will not work out. maybe ross will not like her personality.
oh no, bonnie’s the best!
so ross, how umm, how did it go with bonnie?
ohh, that is too bad!
yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
okay, i hear you! are you capable of talking about any thing else?
okay. would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
no! no! look at that! (drags her away from the window) it is a line of ants! they are working as a team!
(looking in the window) right, oh yeah. wow, oh, it looks like ross is breaking up with her. uff, i hope he let us her down easy. let us go.
oh no! that really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
you said it was okay!
what?! what-what-what-what-what?!!
okay, first of all, breathe. second of all, i do not get it. are not you the one that decided that you did not want to be with ross?
well is not he your friend? do not you want him to be happy?
so?
(sits down next to her and hugs her) oh no.
oh, we killed them all.
wait, if that is his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
hey!
hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
wow, i have the spirit of an old indian women living in mine.
the mailman was downstairs, so i brought up your mail.
now what is fabutec?
waxine!!
oh, it is incredible! i so want to be a waxine girl.
god. do think it really does not hurt? ‘because how can they do that?
they have the best stuff in there.
(reading from the instructions) after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
was it not pain-free?
huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial do not seem to think it is that bad.
(removing one of the strips) ow-ow-ow-ow! oh my god!!!
oh!!
ow!!!
we are all right.
we are all right.
for your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
oh yeah, come here. (puts a little wax on joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)
uh-huh.
(to joey) what, what are they talking about?
whe-where did he put it?!
oh, i knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
should we do something?
hi, it is phoebe. listen someone is going to have to take my 9:00 with mr. rehack, ‘because it is like 9:15 now, and I am not there.
we could eat the wax! it is organic.
no, not the used wax.
they are going to get through this, are not they?
yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
they have been quiet for a long time.
hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
are you two talking about the same baby? hey! have you started off thinking of names yet?
me too!
uh huh! if it is a girl, phoebe, and if it is a boy, phoebo!
yeah, by sandrine.
how-how about you each get five vetoes?
i know her! i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show!
is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
(from outside the bathroom) you guys?
oh, hey, monica, i brought back your iron.
uh-huh.
oh, just as well, i broke this one.
what?
okay.
fine.
then it is really too bad that you can not tell me.
(groans) is it chandler?
well, then tell him to stop staring!
really?! joey?! you do not say.
i do not know, i do not know, i do not know. you know, i mean, on the one hand, mother may i? but y’know on the other hand… no. no, i can not. we are friends. no, oh, no. i do not want to risk what we have.
sure, yeah. i mean, it is joey. i do not want him to get hurt. well, i must say, i am on fire! first chandler, now joey!
sure.
hey.
umm, joey, i know.
i knooow.
i know about your feelings.
yes, and I am sorry. i-i know things worked out for chandler and monica, but that is very rare.
for god sakes, it is rachel!
yeah that is rachel. (to herself) beat me over the head with it.
yeah.
joey, i just think you are getting worked up over nothing. this is probably just a crush.
absolutely! y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
that is right, there you go! crushes happen all the time! i know I have had them for all you guys. well, except for ross and chandler. and I am sure you have had them for us.
mm-hmm. (to herself) throw me a bone here.
hi, bubbles. manly. well, i just thought i would drop by and let you know how it went with joey.
well, you were wrong, he does not like me!
yeah! how would you like it if i sent you to lee majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he did not like you? how would you feel?
really? lee majors is hot!
we are in the bathroom!
(checking for herself) (to monica) mazel tov.
tell us what?
hey mike, what is the capital of peru?
no. it starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
what?
(relived) oh, whew, no, that is bob.
well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who i put food out for, you know. kind of like santa. except santa does not poop on the plate of cookies.
what are those?
ok, fine, if it means that much to you I will get rid of bob.
so weird, you think he is so gross and you are willing to eat his crackers. (mike throws out everything in his mouth)
hey mikey
what are you doing?
to kill bob??
no, mike, i do not want to kill him! i thought we were just going to capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
I will find bob, I will get him. bob? (starts looking) bob! robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) oh wait, i think i hear him. oh - oh my god! bob had babies! bob's a mom!
i do not know, i kind of like bob for a girl.
oh my god, we killed bob!
suzie? (runs over there to check)
be careful, be careful! these are my rat babies!
i had to bring them! we killed their mother, they are our responsibility now. you know, they require constant care. you should know that, rachel, you are a mother.
no! seven rats! i think we should take them home, we need feed them.
well I am sorry rachel, but I am not like you, ok? not everyone can afford help. (she and mike leave)
ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we got to put them straight to bed.
well, you know what, they are our responsibility now.
mate? they are all brothers and sisters.
no. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! oh my god, what are we going to do? we have 7 rats. so what if each of them has 7 rats? and then each of those have 7 rats? that is like ... (starts counting with her fingers) that is math i can not even do! what are we going to do?
yeah, ok. i guess you are right. allright, so we should just give them away. but to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. they are bob's favorites.
you must think I am crazy.
good. it is just so hard, it is hard for me to ... let them go. i guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when i gave birth to my brother's triplets and i had to give them up. (mike is shocked) i have not told you about that yet, have i?
(walks in) hey
listen, i think I have left something here.
(likes the jacket) no, but i like it. i think i left one of my rat babies.
(realizes) ooh, maybe that is him!hey!
yes, i do! today is mike and my one-year anniversary.
yeah!
uh-uh. ehm, a knicks game.
hey, you know what, I have never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I am wearing something fancy pants, and... I am going to put on my finest jewelry and we are going to have sex in a public rest room.
excuse me, anniversary. excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they are in my seat. it is my anniversary. (to mike) here we are! (mike nods). can not believe it is been a whole year!
me too! i never thought i could love someone this much!
you are so generous and kind and (crowd stops cheering) you are amazing in bed (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) it is our anniversary!
oh how lame... oh, it is so tacky, and impersonal.
oh, it is the worst way to propose!
hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever.
well, mine was worse than that.
we were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
well, that is what i said, but it turns out, mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was going to propose to me, i do not think he is ever going to ask again! i mean, i said no in barbados and now this!
oh, i do not know, i do not know, is not that a little desperate?
(to rachel and ross) well, do you think i should propose?
ok, ok, so how should i do it?
yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two (points to ross and chandler) like that?
no, I have got work and then I am proposing..
uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)
I am not. I am praying. (looking up) please let the knicks win... thank you thor! (mike is standing up) where... where are you going?
well, i think you should wait.
well, if you do not... if you do not hold it in, you do not get all the nutrients.
mike hannigan... will you marry me? (mike looks bewildered)
that is not very enlightened!
hey, hey! (shouting) boo us? boo you!
that woman at the game did not know what she was talking about. mike, obviously you have balls.
(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) i would love it. consider it forgotten... but just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, i promise I will say yes. whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
it is in the cake, is not it?
what is the matter with me? how do i keep ruining this? I am sorry, I am sorry!
oh my god!
wait! oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. after that mike starts to kneel again, but then...) oh no! (she was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
uh-huh! (and now mike kneels properly)
yes!
i love you more!
(looking out the window) oh hey, you guys, look! ugly naked guy is putting stuff in boxes!
it is amazing! you better hurry up and fill out an application or I am going to beat you to it.
(looking out the window) oh, look! there is monica and chandler! (starts yelling.) hey! hey, you guys! hey! (chandler and monica start taking each other's clothes off.) ohh!! ohh! ahh-ahhh!!
(screaming) ahhh!! chandler and monica!! chandler and monica!!
chandler and monica!!!!
oh!! my eyes!!! my eyes!!!!
no! they are doing it!!!
you know?!!!
(screaming incoherently.) get in here!!! (motions to join her and rachel.)
you mean whenever monica and chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—oh! all that time monica spent on the phone with sad linda from camp!
oh! oh, i can not believe it! i mean i think it is great! for him. she might be able to do better.
okay, so now they know that you know and they do not know that rachel knows?
or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
well y'know every time that they say that like they are doing laundry we will just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
no! you do not have to do anything! just do not tell them that we know!
well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
and then. i would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. my sexuality.
okay, watch, learn, and do not eat my cookie.
hey! ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
(feels his arm) yeah the material feels so soft—hello mr. bicep! have you been working out?
well, if you really want to know, I am—oh! i can not tell you this.
well actually you are the one person i can not tell this too. and the one person i want to the most.
i think it is just y'know that i have not been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you are looking for something and you just do not even see that it is right there in front of you sipping coffee—oh no, have i said to much? well it is just something to think about. i know i will.
i have quarters! (she holds up a bag of quarters.)
but there is a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. which one did you send?
bye chandler! (she walks up to him.) (quietly.) i miss you already. (she pinches his butt.)
yeah, why do not you just find another apartment?
he broke that.
i would not bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
(in a sexy voice) oh? (takes the phone from rachel.) hello you.
eh?
really?
I will have to get back to you on that. okay, bye! (hangs up.) oh my god! he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
no!
god, they thought they can mess with us! they are trying to mess with us?! they do not know that we know they know we know! (joey just shakes his head.) joey, you can not say anything!
all right. all right! if he wants a date? he is going to get a date. all right, I am going to go in.
(laughs) please.
so chandler, i-I would love to come by tonight.
oh absolutely. shall we say, around seven?
good. I am really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
okay, rachel, get me perfume!
and joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (he begrudgingly does so.)
okay.
good idea!
oh now, do not give away the farm!
chandler.
i was going too. (they go inside and he closes the door.) umm, i brought some wine. would you like some?
so, here we are. nervous?
no, i want this to happen.
maybe, maybe I will dance for you. (she starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that is silly at the same time.)
thanks! y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me want to rip that sweater vest right off!
really?
no. no! it is just y'know first, i want to take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
he is not backing down. he went to get lotion.
joey! (examining the dress.) wow, you did not rip off any buttons.
umm, not without you, lover. (she slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) so, this is my bra.
you should be. I am very bendy. (pause) I am going to kiss you now.
ooh.
here it comes. our first kiss.
and why not?!
you are-you are what?!
i just—i thought you guys were doing it, i did not know you were in love!
god! (she turns and buttons up.)
(entering, wearing santa pants) hello!
excuse me.
oh, yeah! you like ‘them? i just, i went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. these are sooo comfortable!
what?
nuh-uh! they are maternity pants. they even came with a list of baby names. (pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who is been naughty and who is been nice.) see, these names are good, and these names are bad. (finally, she figures it out.) ohh.
i do not know! how are the-the-the-the, y’know—you are clothes are not funny.
boy! i did not see that coming!
that is too hard. too hard!
hey, so? are you going to do it?
or you could end up with everything.
ooh, this is so exciting! ooh, god, what are you going to bet?
okay. umm, ooh, ooh—oh, i have a game!
this is great!
oh, well, it does not have a name—oh, okay, phoebeball! no, it does not have a name. umm, okay, monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
good! good! five points!
all right, joey, same question.
ooh, three points. both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
oh, i have cards!
yeah! here! (she grabs a deck out of her purse) oh no, these are the trick deck. okay. here yes. okay.
what make you think i can?! (shields her eyes from it.)
i do not know. ooh! ooh! look it! (she fans out the trick deck.) ah-ha!
(opening the door) i had nothing to do with it. (closes the door.) (opens the door.) okay, it was my idea, but i do not feel good about it.
that is so funny to think if you would just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
okay, scarf’s done. (it is not really a scarf, it is just a bunch of yarn that phoebe has tied together. just then, ross and emily enter dragging with them joey and chandler.)
hey!
what? oh, are you pregnant too?!
ok, so this is pretty much what is happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like "forget about her" but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, "oh my god." so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she did not know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh-oh! so, that is pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been?
oh my god. this is huge. this is bigger than huge. this is like, all right, what is bigger than huge?
yes.
because, you know, (in that voice) if you do not look good, we do not look good. i love that voice.
oh, ok. how, it is been so long since you have had sex, you are wondering if they have changed it?
all right, so what were you thinking?
ohh! no.
because, I am just, I am incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
i know I am not, but you are, and i was trying to spare your feelings.
I am still on "no."
what is going on?
ewww! (gets up and walks away.)
where?
(to paulo) ok, you are going to have to not touch my ass.
all right. ok, but, but!  you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and monica about it.
all right. (talking to monica's hair.) now some of you are going to get cut, and some of you are not. but i promise none of you are going to feel a thing.
all right, that is it, i quit.
yeah, but this (makes monica's face) is not the face of a person who trusts a person. ok, this (makes monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know, does not trust a person.
would you relax? i know what i am doing. this is how he wears it.
demi moore.
well, he was a he in arthur, and in ten.
oh.  oh!
oh my god!
oh my god! I am sorry, I am sorry. which one's demi moore?
oh, she is got gorgeous hair.
it is too soon to tell. she is resting, which is a good sign.
I am not going to lie to you, ross, it does not look good. i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
your hair looks too good, i think it would upset her. ross, why do not you come on in.
(to chandler and ross) thank you.
oh yeah!  oh, i can do that.
you want to do it right now?
(to rachel) ok, i just want to be really sure this time. andie mcdowell's the girl from four weddings and a funeral, right?
oh, yeah. ok, thank you.
hey!
oh, you will not believe who moved back to town.
you know what amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes amanda in a british accent) "oh, so sorry to catch you on your mo-bile!" if-if you do not want to get me on my mo-bile, do not call me on my mo-bile!"
oh, i know! "oh...i slept with billy joel". all right, who has not?
ugh, let us just cut her out!
cut her out of our lives! just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
oh, yeah. could be rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
oh, you are right! i was just kidding about rachel. babysitting is a gas!
ok, do not hold thy breath!
why, why, why did not you just say no!
(leaving) fine, fine! you would not hold up well under torture!
i did!
hey!
no.
oh! well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
(makes a face) are you kidding, i love it!
hi!
musty!
well...kind of.
yeah well, in america you are just an "ass".
(also gets up and starts taking her purse) oh my god. was mike with him?
oh chandler! thank god you are alive. monica, can i talk to you outside for a minute?
please, monica? in the hall?
it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
you are also so generous and kind and scrappy!
exactly! look, no matter what i tried to do, i could not keep you out of my life. of all the people i have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
yeah, you are. and I am so glad that you fought your way back in, because i do not know what i would do without you.
yeah, i guess you are right.
(entering) oh hey you guys!
hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
uh-huh, (to chandler) and you?
okay, good.
well last night, i met monica’s.
yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half.
well he is tall.
he has brown hair.
he works with food!
obviously, and he is british.
yeah? and, he is-he is so centered and mature and confident.
oh, I am so sorry. um, and maybe I am wrong! i but—y’know I am going to go out with him again, I will find out more.
well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s got to eat.
oh! hi!
umm, chandler, monica, this is don.
(mouths to chandler) soul mate.
(cough talks) soul mate.
nothing! i swear to god i did not know you guys would be here! and the good news is you did not believe in soul mates. so…
they are just talking, and y’know what? just because i think they are soul mates does not mean anything’s going to happen.
yeah?
do not worry, we will find you someone else.
I am so sorry.
i do not know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! i do not know how you fight that.
morning.
what is that?
it is a baby chick and duck!
i did not see that coming.
yes.
that is the rule, though.
guess what? you are almost an uncle!
yeah, and i have a definite feeling it is going to be a girl.
have you seen him throw a ball?
what is that smile? did something happen with you two?
but do you want to get back together?
(screaming) yay!
(quietly) yay!
oh, this is like the best day ever. ever! you guys might get back together, monica and chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! oh, i feel like I am in a musical! (singing) "daa - raa... when the sun comes up, bright and beaming! and the moon comes..."
guess we will never know how it ends.
(interrupting) dive. yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
ross, you have got to tell her how you feel!
ross, rachel does not know that you want to get back together. if she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go.
I am telling you! oh, okay! this is the part of the musical where there would be a really good convincing song. (singing) "bam-bam, do not take no for an answer. bam-bam, do not let love fly away. bam-bam-bam-bam..."
can not a girl finish a song around here?
wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? good luck, mom.
unbelievable!
hey, what are you working on?
how sweet! oh, is that the baby?
hey. so, did you talk to rachel?
what?
how can you compare yourself to gunther? i mean, sure, he is sexy in a more obvious way. you have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
uh, joe?
no, you do not! she is going to paris! she is going to meet somebody. do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it is... it is a city of gunthers!
hey! what do you have there?
honey, that is gorgeous!
yeah, did she sound happy about it? because my friend ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
oh, jack bing. i love that. ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "jack bing, morning gazette. I am going to blow this story wide open!"
oh yeah? well, tell me which one, and I will try slip it in my coat.
one? how about a whole bunch?
yeah! ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the von trapp family! only without the nazis. although that sounds kind of dull.
so, you just let her go?
but now she will never know how he feels!
woo!
wait, wait! get your coat! get your coat!
you did not bring one! my cab's downstairs, I will drive you to the airport.
hurry!
that is okay. if - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it is better if you are thrown from the car.
okay!
i - i do not take passengers.
my medallion number is, "get out of the cab!"
get out of the cab!
you can open your eyes now.
yes.
yes, she jumped right back up.
do you want to get to rachel in time?
you should have thought of that before you got in!
toll-booth.
(screaming) toll-booth! four bucks. there are quarters in the glove compartment.
hurry!
okay.
damn, that window is clean.
ross, where are you going?
what? what are you just going to walk up to her at the gate? have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
you have to get a ticket to get past security.
not with that attitude! now, haul ass!
just one? i drive you all the way down here, and i do not get to see how it works out?
we are on our honeymoon.
I am so lucky i married you.
no, did we miss it?
maybe we have the flight-number wrong. god.
hey, it is me. here is ross.
well, I have never gone this fast before.
she is got her cell, you could call her.
you do not have any other choice!
rachel? oh, good. hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
(to ross) for what it is worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
uh, rach, hang on.
uhm, actually no. no, you have... you have to get off the plane.
i have this feeling that something is wrong with it. something is wrong with the left philange.
i do not see her.
there she is!
(screaming) rachel!!
okay, you are on.
I am sorry.
hey.
yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
he went home. he did not want to see anybody.
hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
so, i guess this is it.
(looking up) there it is! oh, look at that! is not mother nature amazing?
well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that is pretty amazing too.
oh! i will not say, ‘no’ to a movie!
shh! get me out of here.
(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) please do not be a space ship. please do not be a space ship. (she turns on the light and looks around and finds that it is the smoke detector that is beeping.) oh thank god! (she moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. she sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets there it beeps again. she opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.) how could you be beeping?! i just disconnected you! i took out your battery! how can…
do not interrupt me!!
okay. so, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (she points at each as she says it.) okay so, to get the beeping to stop all i have to do… (she picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. she then gets up and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) well done, pheebs. (she resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (yelling.) what do you want from me?!!!!!!!
okay, this is where you and i part ways. (she drops the blanket into the chute.) noisy bitch!
oh my god! how did you get back here?!
(scared) fire alarm? (she opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) oh! hi, officer—fireman, can-can i help you?
that is not mine.
how do you know?
okay do you—okay, do you have a search warrant? because the last time i checked this was still america!
fine! (she takes the blanket.) but please god; tell me how to stop them from going off!
there is a reset button?! ugh, thank you! thank you! (he exits and she goes to shut it off.) there is a reset button! my god! why did not i see that! (she takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? (finds it.) oh here it is! (picks it up off of the floor.) oh! (she presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. in frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) ohh, god!
yeah, i think so, yeah.
i dunno, because you are smart, you are funny...
yeah, you have homosexual hair.
oh, that sucks!
maybe that is because she is not really gone.
hm, i mean maybe no-one ever really goes. ever since my mom died, every now and then, i get the feeling that she is like right here, y'know? (she circles her hand around her right shoulder. chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) oh! and debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- i always get this really strong debbie vibe whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...i miss her.
thanks!
y'know, i dunno who this is, but it is not debbie. (hands back the pencil)
(entering) hi, sorry I am late, i could not find my bearings.
what did i say?
god, what a great day. ...what? weather-wise!
okay, do not worry, I am just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
you missed a belt loop.
okay, it is in spasm.
hey, look who is up! how do you feel?
ooh! that is so nice...
does anyone want to watch tv?
monica your remote does not work.
oh. aw, forget it.
wow! see, and i did not think you would be able to come up with anything.
i do not know about that. I have got one that is worse.
oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? yes, mine's worse!
oh, this life! oh okay no, chandler's is worse.
of course you do not sweetie. you are brand new.
oh no, i know! i know! it is the one where joey got monica's turkey stuck on his head!
(surprised) hello?
joey? what is going on?
oh my god!
(walks him to the kitchen) easy. step. how did it get on?
oh my god! monica's going to totally freak out!
well, of course it smells really bad. you have your head up a dead animal.
hey!
no, it is not supposed to be funny, it is supposed to be scary.
all right, hold on! okay, let us just all think.
oh wait! that can not be the one rachel's talking about. she did not even know that happened. so which one was it?
oh, i can not believe you called her fat.
oh, no, i have the cutest christmas story!
fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
oh, yeah!
..then I have already seen this one! (turns off the tv.)
she is already fluffed that pillow... monica, you know, you have already fluffed that- (monica glares at her.) -but, it is fine!
monica- hi! um, monica, you are scaring me. i mean, you are like, you are like all chaotic and twirly. and not-not in a good way.
yeah, it is beautiful.
no, look, do not touch that!
doy! probably right before she lost it!
(while everyone else is stunned) ooh! i found it!
she is so great! i miss her.
y'know, it is even worse when you are twins.
yeah. we do not speak. she is like this high-powered, driven career type.
she is a waitress.
you know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kind of looks like an old potato.
okay!
ohhh, wow.
what?! i thought you were crazy about her!
yep!
oh my god, that is so freaky! turn him off!!
ooh, hey, could we put on the news? i think it might be raining.
(whispering to ross) janice.
yeah, i know, i do that ‘because it makes me look taller.
well, why are you doing this anyway?
you are kidding! and he plays rugby?! that is so funny. (realises) ohh! i see how you did that. all right.
(to the player) hi.
whoa! (the player leaves and to joey) i kind of liked it.
no offence but, y’know sometimes it is hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…
oh, poor baby.
she is right! you have to stop!
now, are you sure you do not want to go see a doctor?
ooh, ice! i am so in the mood for ice! (they go and get the coffee and the ice leaving ross and emily alone.)
see? I am doing it. i am totally doing it. (suddenly it stops working.) i lost it.
(entering) hey!
oh. finally! oh. (sits back in relief.)
I am going to get some coffee, anyone want anything?
(interrupting him) i was just being polite!
hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
umm, i…i just think you do not expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
umm, phoebe buffay.
oh okay, it is p as in phoebe, h as in hoebe, of as in oebe, e as in ebe, b as in bee-bee and e as in (in an australian accent) ‘ello there mate!
get your foot off my contestant! judge!
ohhh.
(turning from ross.) no!! hey-hey that is not a nutter-butter, that is just an old wonton!
ohh, tough call.
hey!
wow! nice! manly and also kind of a slut.
oh, please!
(entering, hurridly) hey, you guys! look what i found! look at this! (she hands chandler a picture) that is my mom’s writing! look.
y'know what that means?
no-no, that is not, that is not me phoebe, that is her pal phoebe. according to her high school yearbook, they were like b.f.f. (ross and bonnie look at her quizzically) best friends forever.
i know! so this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my dad is. so i looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. so maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
so great! okay! tomorrow we are going to drive out to montauk.
oh, i am having the best karma this week. first, i find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
oh, i was not talking about his karma.
and this time, they have ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
oy!!
oh, yeah, bob said there might be flood damage.
(at the door) knock, knock, knock.
(entering) are you ah, phoebe abott?
hi phoebe abott, I am your best friends daughter!
no, i-i mean your-your old best friend, here. (hands her the picture) lily, from high school. remember?
(points to herself) phoebe. (points to her) phoebe. phoebe, yeah. she named me after you i guess.
yes!! yes! yes! yes!! that is my dad, that is frank! yeah! I am sorry I am getting all flingy.
no-no, sorry. cookies are good, thanks.
(goes and gets some cookies) well, so, umm, anyway umm, I have been, I have been looking for my father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
(disappointed) oh, okay. well, so tell me everything about my parents. everything.
oh, what? what was it?
(happily) yeah, no, it was great.
(entering) oh, hey!
oh, so, how are we doing?
I am kind, caring, and sweet. what is monica like?
ohh, i think she knows where my dad is.
she was acting, she was pretending like she has not heard from him on years, but i found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows monica)! is not this what he would look like now?
i do not know, but we are having dinner tomorrow night, so i figured, she is going to tell me then. y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, i do not know! so, you are all bored?
all right, I am going to close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever i point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
okay.
okay. (starts to spin) ooh, y'know we could just do this. (she stops at chandler)
monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. it has not happened yet, but we are all very excited.
come on, take ‘them off!!
shhh! shhhh! joey’s asleep.
after he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
she cancelled! my namesake cancelled on me!
yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. she is avoiding me, she does not want to tell me where my father is. she knows, and she will not tell me.
yeah, well, do not “aww pheebs, that sucks!” me yet. (she starts to leave)
well, she is out of town so, there is got to be something in her house that tells me where my father is.
well, are any of those people here?!
okay, look i-i-i do something nice, okay? I will-I will fill her ice trays.
ow! my ass. okay. okay. (she manages to climb completely inside and the window slams shut.) oh, shhh!
no! no!! it is me! it is me! i-i did not want to make any noise!
I am sorry.
i-i, came to fill your ice cube trays.
umm, okay, okay, look. i took this picture from your fridge. okay, because i know that this is my father. yeah, this is frank buffay and you are standing right there next to him. now, look i deserve to know where i came from. all right? so if you can help me find my father then you should! otherwise, you are just mean! (pause) so, just tell me the truth!
my father is chuck magioni?
oh.
heh?
(dejected) hi, you guys.
well it is just—it is one of those situations that i just hate. y’know? a massage client gave me three tickets to the helmet-pelts exhibit at the morgan chase museum.
no! no! it is just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
okay that is so generous!
great! okay then it is just us girls!
yeah.
it is mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
oh, this is so exciting! you get your picture back up on the wall of fame! eek!
(gasps) ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to matt lauer. look at him, smiling at me. (giggles) yeah i know; we would be great together!
so umm, now do you have any of matt lauer’s clothes here? maybe? just ones that have not been cleaned yet?
hey, and then lunch.
oh wow. what, do you think maybe he is going to tell you that he is gay?
no reason! that would just be a really big surprise, right?
yeah, but there is a two-year wait. and then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. that is four years. chandler’s not going to wait that long. he is going to find somebody else, y’know? someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (rachel agrees.)
me too!
i do not know, i do not have anyone right now. y’know?
do not feel too sorry for me. at least my boyfriend is not gay.
do not even get me started on yours!
yeah?
no! why?
well for the regular guy, it is bad, but chandler, oh dear god!
what are you going to do?
rachel said that!
oh! here it is! (noticing it next to the door.) ooh, joey! why did you sign it, "son of a bitch?" (son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)
okay, maybe ask this guy.
well, what did he do?
joey!
well, we should go.
(entering from her room) hey, did she buy it?
so did heldi show you the place?
i can not believe you are going to ask monica to marry you!
yeah joey that is so gross!
(giggles) I am pretty.
oh i do! (she grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) oh, y’know what? no. (pause) wait a second. (she removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) i know it is in here somewhere.
(to ross) which-which sister is this? is this the spoiled one or that is bitter?
never mind, i got it.
of course, yeah!
ooh, i like cards.
seriously, i do not rachel’s going to think it is a good idea.
i would love that job!
sorry jill.
oh well, all right, i got (ross hands her a bag) (to ross) thank you, i got uh, this y’know "i want a job sweater." (holds up the same sweater.)
and, and then i got uh, these are apartment pants.
yeah, you never heard of them?
what about, what about when i said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was i?
(gets up and sits between them) okay-okay, why do not i sit here and you will both stop it!
hey.
umm, i think there is something you should maybe know.
no. no. it is just i was umm, i was with ross and jill after you left and umm, I am pretty sure i saw a little spark between them.
yeah i mean it is probably nothing, but i just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
yeah!
yeah.
yeah.
okay then.
but great news about the apartment pants, huh?
or, y’know, i used to beg for money. of course it helps if you have got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it) going on. wow! i still have it!
hey!
ohh! we went to a self-defense class today!
now, we can kick anybody’s ass!
yeah it is! it is! it is freshwater eel!
(deadpan) come on ross. we are sorry. please tell us what it is.
you mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
no.
ooh, joey, that is actually a really good idea!
you guys!
oh, i love paper mache! what did you make?
what is that?
ohh! i have! i have! i started making these little sock bunnies! (she takes out a sock that is been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) oh for crying out loud!
now, it is you little bunny friend. (she sticks it in rachel’s face and they both laugh.)
ross!!!
ohh, you are a freak!!
pat sajak?
alex trebek?
chuck woolery?
say we are unagi!
(stopping her) no rachel! they got here first!
why is ross doing that?
we should help him!
all right. hold on. (she starts digging in the chair.) i got it. nickel! (donates it.) how much more do we need?
okay, dime! (donates that.) you guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (finds something else.) oh no, wait! look it! whoa! (looks at it.) oh my god, this is a police badge!
yeah, i should probably take it back. ooh, but you know what? while I am at the police station, i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (she crosses her fingers in hope.)
oh. oh! madam? excuse me, madam?
you can not put your cigarette out on a tree!
no but you should not! do not ever do that again.
hold it! (grabs the badge) n.y.p.d! freeze punk!
yeah that is right you are so busted. (to no one in particular.) book  them.
save it red! unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
you apologize to the tree right now or i am calling for backup. (the woman calls her bluff.) (screaming at no one in particular) backup! backup!!
okay, cancel backup! cancel backup!
…so this guy was all (mumbles.) and I am all, buffay, homicide. (flashes the badge.) it was just so cool!
i know but I am having so much fun doing good deeds.
you could get arrested, right now! (flashes the badge and they glare at her.) all right, yeah, i got to take it back. I am totally drunk with power. (she heads for the door just as joey enters.)
(to joey) hey.
excuse me, is this your car?
well i do not think it is very nice of you to park here, y'know you are blocking the entrance.
well, it is a problem for me, which means it is a problem for you because I am a cop. (shows the badge.)
ohh, no. (pause) oh okay, so you are a cop which means you can park anywhere, because i know that because I am a cop too. so, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. (tries to leave.)
i-I am with the umm, the 57th.
I am in vice. yeah, in fact I am undercover right now. I am a who are.
umm, do you know, umm sipowicz?
yeah, big guy, kind of bald.
(starts to walk away, but stops) do not try to call him or anything, because he is not there, he is out. his umm, his partner just died.
i-i sure will, take care. (starts walking off.)
oh. (she starts laughing. then she throws the badge at him and runs away.)
ooh, god, it is him! it is that cop! god, i can not believe it! he found me!
well, if I am going down, I am taking you (points at all of them) with me. (they all look at her.) harboring a fugitive? that is one to three years minimum. good luck chandler. (she opens the door to the cop from before.) okay, you can arrest me. fine. but you will never make it stick and you know it!
yep! as long as you understand that I am going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he will make you look like a fool. a fool!
i would love it if i were not here!
me?!
wow! i did not see that coming! you are-you are asking me out!
umm, yeah, I would like to go out with you officer…
gary.
yeah! so--ooh, i got to ask you though. how did you know where to find me?
ohh, impressive.
yeah, we will talk at dinner.
all right, i can not wait!
(overdoing it) oh my god!!
okay, this is inexcusable. i am shocked to my very core!
another lie. you have a sickness!
(coming in from the bathroom) oh, good, good, you guys are here! listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
okay, well I will bring them by tomorrow morning. okay, and uh, by the way, they are not actually puppies, they are frank and alice’s triplets. okay, see ya! (exits.)
(stops) please! please! please! please! oh please! please! please! frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I am nervous ‘because I have never done that before by myself!
what about me? i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while, i do not have a roommate.
maybe you could be my roommate!
yeah!
umm, she said she would be back december 26th.
(rapidly) I am doing okay. i think it is going well. do you think they are having fun? am i talking to fast?
na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
yeah? (checking the final diaper) well this is not what i ordered.
hey!
i do not know why i was so nervous about this. and i do not know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy.
no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, that is just going to mess them up.
what?!
oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.
oh, i can still do that.
how did that happen?!!
yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
what?! no, you can not, you can not leave me here with them! we are baby-sitting!
but you-you can not leave me with them! we-we are a team! we are playing a zone! they are going to triple team me!
but no, because a doctor will not be able to help him, it is just going to y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
I am pretty sure it is gun.
a real man would not just run to the hospital! (they do not stop.) no! what would, what would krog do? (they ignore her and phoebe is left alone.)
me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, I am going to take that spit bubble as, "yeah, i do!" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, I will set you up with a clean one. (she throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) okay, I am sorry. i did not mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? ‘because let us face it, we are at monica’s. (she crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) i broke it. all right. well, that is just the way that goes. (she throws out both the flowers and the vase.) okay, good. (she turns around and only counts two babies.) why are there only two of you? where is leslie? well, you can not answer. (she starts looking for her) leslie? where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (she turns around and finds that leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the tv cabinet.) well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh! (she picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) oh, you are a lot mischievous! well, it will dry. (closes the drawer with her foot.) (to leslie) okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who are not there! (they both have disappeared as well.)
(exhausted) how do you feel?
okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed ‘them, bathed ‘them, and put ‘them to bed.
i know, the babies are asleep.
i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself!
how come?
okay, i did not hear that.
wow! and hey, it is cool if you are a lesbian! (gives her a thumbs up)
that is weird.
your nails.
oh, no, i meant that it is weird that you only have nine now.
okay, do not panic. I am going to go to the store, I am going to get you another set of nails, no one’s going to know, and you are going to look great. (she runs over to get her coat.) oh! oh, it is ‘because they are going to eat—that is the problem.
and! whoever finds it wins the prize!
i do not get it.
op, the ruined quiches are ready.
hey!
this used to be your room? (she nods ‘yes’) wow! you must have been in really good shape as a kid.
well, who cares what your mom thinks? so you pulled a monica.
no but, why does that have to be a bad thing. just change what it means. y'know? go down there and prove your mother wrong. finish the job you were hired to do, and we will call that pulling a monica.
okay, umm, if a kid gets straight a’s, his parents would say, "yeah, he pulled a monica." y'know? or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "yeah i know, he pulled a monica." or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "yeah, that one’s outta here." though some things do not change.
wow! my breasts are really strong. (she goes and joins monica.)
they are not even touching the lasagna!
oh, they love your casserole.
it is hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
umm, you might even say that she pulled a monica. (they both look at her) (to monica) she does not know we switched it. (monica nods her head ‘no.’)
oh.
oh god, korea is such a beautiful country.
huh?
sure. yeah, he is kind of sexy.
okay so, we will just come up with some kind of signal if it is going well you can take off.
oh. why not?
oh rachel, this is all so ‘papa do not preach.’
wow! oh well, i will be there!
gosh. I am not going to let that man make you eat your baby. (they both sit down by the rest of the gang and phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) oh. hey! who is that guy? i think i know him.
oh my god!!! monica!! he is the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
your secret bachelorette party…
she untied his g-string with her teeth. (pause) somebody stop me!
oh, i-i do not eat meat.
yeah, i do not eat that either.
he is right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.
rachel!
why, so he can get mad at the baby?
it is slang for pregnant.
I am sorry i will not be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I am really busy that day. yeah, i already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
it is lafite. the ’74 latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
I would better go. (she goes and sits down in the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000, the chair that sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at her.) just over here: i do not want to miss the fight.
that is it?! you call that a fight? come on! "we were on a break!" "no we were not!" what happened to you two?!
(entering, quietly) wow, you told your dad the truth.
want to go see a movie?
i know. but do not you think that it should be called order and law?
do not get me started on that.
sounds like somebody wants to be mr. pizza delivery girl.
(looking through the pizzas) okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay ross, i know she is pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! she forgot my vegetarian!
see? vegetarianism benefits everyone.
this is so cool!
but i like it here!
okay, well i think that they are in my purse. why do not you go get dressed and I will look for them.
okay! (walks over to rachel) rach, hi, i need those earrings you borrowed.
i guess so. (see, the brief possession did not affect her at all, like we could really tell.)
wait, rach! where is the other one?
rachel karen green, where is the other earring?!
well, what am i going to tell monica? she wants to wear them tonight!
these are her earrings.
why not?
(entering from rachel's bedroom) i found it!
on your dresser.
(smiling) maybe your scene's coming up?
(smiling) this is terrible, what are you going to do?
(not smiling) that is not good.
but i already gave them back to you!
all right, i already did not give them back to you, that is what i said. (walks away over to rachel.) where is that other earring?
make sure you check chandler's jewelry box.
okay, we have like ten minutes. do you want me to get into that now?!
(she just looks at him) why are you being weird?
no, that would be, "why are you being cute?"
ohh! i did not get that.
did you find it?
okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
(to rachel) what are we going to do?!
all right well, we are just going to have to tell monica, that is all.
i suppose i could tell her it is just all my fault.
mon, can i talk to you for a sec?
umm, i lost one of your earrings. I am sorry! i am so, so sorry!
i will replace it, i promise. i feel so terrible.
no.
yeah! you are the best!
oh, right! (hands monica back her sunglasses.)
i-i-i found it interesting.
(walking over to ross) ross?
what else do they add smell too?
oh no!
i am definitely going to watch that!
definitely!
oh, then no.
no, no, it is just my tooth.
no thanks, i have a good one too. i just, i, i can not see him.
because, every time i go to the dentist, somebody dies.
yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt mary, and then there was umm, john, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘albino bob’.
yes, while i was in the chair! that is why i take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it is not about oral hygiene, i floss to save lives!
well tell that to them. oh! you can not, their dead.
(trying to bite into an apple) ow! ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
all right, fine, fine, but if you are my next victim, do not come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the tv set.
although, do not feel like you can not visit.
well, you could wait ‘til i go to the dentist, maybe I will kill him.
well, I am going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... all right, just look out! okay, and um, i also just want to, i just want to tell you all that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
(running through the door) no! oh! you are alive! you are alive!
yeah, well, we will see about that. can i use your phone? i just want to call everyone i know.
(on phone) ‘hey! you are not dead! okay, see ya!’
(rushing in) okay. if you are alive you answer your phone!
woo-hoo! the curse is broken! i called everybody i know, and everyone is alive.
what?
oh my god! i killed him! i killed another one! and this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
I am telling you he is dead. what we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
he is alive! he is a-live!!!
(joining him) love....
i know.
I have found....
why?! what is happening to the coffee house?! (monica looks at her.) oh! (realizes.)
what are they?
that play?
the movie?
ohh!
oh, yeah! back then y’know, we called the great war. it really was!
congratulations!
go ahead.
yes! very good.
ross, please! my make-up! (he walks away angrily.)
(walking up) what is up? (rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) tell monica I am sorry. (pause) tell her yourself!
oh my god! chandler just left though!
or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he is changed his name, y’know? tell monica I am sorry.
do not be so negative! good god! is not it possible that sorry is sitting in there (joey and rachel’s apartment) right now?!
(pointing at ross) okay but if you do not find him and bring him back, i am going to hunt you down and kick your ass!
oh man.
okay. well there is one down.
y’know she might not even notice he is gone.
shhh! stop it! stop it rachel! you can not do this here! (she drags her into the bathroom.)
yeah, but you have got to pull yourself together! monica can not see you like this! then she will know something is wrong!
yeah. (looks.) oh, that is gone too. this is monica’s bathroom right?!
no-no! i-i…i found one.
(looking into the trash can) sure. (reaching into the trash can.) do you need some floss? (grabs a piece of it.)
oh here is a whole bunch.
(finding something interesting in the trash can) oh my god!
there was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it is positive. monica’s pregnant. (rachel covers her mouth.) so i guess she will not be totally alone.
i know! monica’s going to have a baby! hey, can this count as her something new?
hey, do you think this is why chandler took off?
oh god, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! the bride is pregnant. the groom is missing. and I am still holding this. (she throws the test back into the trash.)
right.
yeah, okay. hey, wait. do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
you told them he was missing?
okay. I am going with you.
ross, you are tired. you have been looking all night. and clearly you suck at this.
okay. wait, do you know how you are going to stall her?
all right. good luck.
oh my god! is that him? (she points at someone.)
he could be in disguise, y’know.
what the hell are you doing?!
why not?!
but look chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than i do. but i totally believe you can do this.
(entering) found the vest! i mean we are going to have to keep an eye on it, y’know make sure we do not lose it again…
so-so you two were married huh? what happened? you just drift apart?
oh my god monica!
(to rachel) wait! maybe, maybe you are overreacting! you do that y’know.
okay. oh but do not tell them monica’s pregnant because, they frown on that.
okay.
yeah!
what is going on?
oh my god! why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
hey! oh!
you know?!
what? you will hi-ya?
well you obviously did not see chucky 3.
what?
oh and they are going to have a baby.
it starts?
that is so smart! (to chandler, under her breath) break it off. break it off now.
hey! ross!
i need to talk to you, it is pretty urgent. it is about monica and chandler.
well, umm, not much. but, i was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? so, could i just move in with you for a couple days?
nothing—why?!
oh yeah it is! I am going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
(to the students) oh, I am sorry. I am so rude. does anyone want to come to the movies?
oh ross, hi.
I am sorry, I am with a client right now.
okay, let us talk outside.
what is the big deal? i did it at monica and chandler’s!
(pause as she considers it) okay, well ross, what is this really about?
okay, i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. i just do not know what the big deal is!
(gasps) my god! what did you order?!
look, why do not you just pay for it yourself?
(reading the slip of paper) wow! (in a sultry voice) hello, mr. chandler.
wow, money and a firm hand. finally a chandler i can get on board with.
(entering) ross! how could you do that to an old man?!
my massage client, arthur? his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
he said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
well, he is never coming back! okay? you just cost me eight dollars a week!
oh, it is my fault?! you did not have to massage him! you could have sent him away! you could have not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back!
(entering) hey!
i brought you my old maternity clothes! (sets a bag on the counter.)
yeah! and look, (grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (there is a stretchy part in front.) and then after the baby’s born, they are great for shoplifting melons.
turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!
(entering) hey!
happy thanksgiving!
anything i can do to help?
sure!
okay. (she starts folding the napkins in half.)
yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (monica exits.) (to chandler) so how is the game?
what?
i do not believe you! that is…brilliant! and monica has no idea?
well i want to get in on this. hey mon? i do not think i can help you after all, i did not realize this game was on.
well normally i do not, but y’know…(looks at the tv)…green bay is playing.
well it is only like my favorite bay! {actually, it is not bad. it just gets a little cold in winter, but in wisconsin winter only lasts from august to june. j }
(nonchalantly glancing) hey. (turns back around.) wow! (looks up.) well done.
oh okay.
noooo!! damn you ref! you burn in hell!!!
yeah.
(simultaneously) green bay.
well the lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the green bay…mermen.
i think you do.
what?! what else did you do?
oh, come on will! just take off your shirt and tell us!
oh! (they all look.) wow!
so how did this happen? did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
i want to join!
I am sorry. I am sorry. i never got to be in a club. i-i did not go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french. bonjour.
okay. (goes over and hugs him.) it is exactly how I would imagined it would be.
joey! those are my maternity pants!
is there anything we can do for you?
no! joey, you are going to be great!
(in a sexy voice to chandler) I will be waiting.
no, I am just deciding which one to use—I am going to start writing another book!
well, if you must know i have written 14 books. and as i am the only one who has read them, i can tell you that they all have been very well received.
oh, rachel and i have appointments to get our hair cut.
i want to see what he wants first.
you are elizabeth’s father, huh? i can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
yeah. not looking for dates. (monica turns in horror.)
(writing frantically) you guys, I am sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
yeah, it is about relationships. y’know? the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. this stuff is great!
and how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (chandler and monica kiss.) and how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it is a compliment.
hey!
well, why do not you just get him fired?
(writing in her book) "you wish."
I am not writing about you! I am writing about other people.
marcia and chester.
i see what you are doing!
ooh, i have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
(turning around in the chair) hi!
i know what time you said.
well actually, i know what time chester and marcia said.
quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it is my book to the rescue, huh? (reading her book) ooh, very interesting. yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
thanks! so are you.
(reading from her book) mon… (pause as she restarts) marcia and chester are planning on seeing a movie on sunday night. marcia thinks they are supposed to meet at six, chester thinks it is at seven.
that is right.
(writing in her book) marcia and chester are mad at phyllis.
ready?
okay.
it is...
and…
please...
leave…
yeah, i know because you have all the good words. what do i get? i get "it is," "and" oh I am sorry, i have "a." forget it.
all right, so let us switch.
okay.
hi…
it is…
and…
please...wait, how did you do that?
oh, you are no ordinary roommate are you?
really?
okay, let us go running!
let us run towards them!
all right, wait just one more second. hi, it is phoebe and rachel's. please leave a message, thanks!
uh-huh. you have met your match rachel green.
i have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I will catch up.
okay. (starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far apart) come on! that is not running! let us go! (rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)
hey!
why? why would you do that?
(jumps in front of rachel) hi! oh yeah, uh-huh, it is me. i saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. you lied so you could run by yourself.
please rachel, i am not an idiot. (runs off)
sure
so, what should you have done?
uh-huh, which is...?
so?
why do you care?
but people that you do not know and will never see again.
well, i did not get embarrassed running next to miss (panting). but no, okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you are uptight.
that is okay rachel. I am not judging you; that is just who you are. me. I am more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, because that is the only way it is fun. y'know, i mean did not you ever run so fast you thought your legs were going to fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan? (rachel looks confused) the neighbor's dog.
hey!
see? and you do not care if people are staring, it is just for a second because then you are gone!
yeah?
he is awfully short and i think he is talking to himself. and to be completely honest, he is not that good in bed.
wait a second! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
this is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
oh absolutely yeah! oh and keep in mind, now, i was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms i was-i was thrice as randy.
yeah. yeah, i remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of evander holyfield from a foot locker.
yeah.
yeah. yeah, that is what you need a good…pill.
(sitting down next to ross) y’know she has a face ross!
bye.
wait, I am-I am sorry. what is the big deal about a holiday card?
oh hey! so, how did your doctor’s appointment go?
oh my god.
okay, remember that little problem i was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
you wish.
oh yeah? come and get it.
ugh! women!
give her a key to your apartment.
no, we hate that.
(entering with some guy) hey. ooh ross! how did the conversation go?
where?! (ross exits.)
hi! okay, monica, rachel, this is my friend roger.
so umm, I am going to get us some drinks. (to rachel) would you help me out?
umm, he is here to have sex with you.
you are welcome.
it is okay, he is a virgin.
yeah, okay let us leave these two alone.
fine! then you tell roger because he was really looking forward to this! (phoebe exits.)
hi. listen, I am sorry about that whole thing with roger. it really was not right, and i, and i want to make it up to you, so umm, i brought you something that i think you will really enjoy. (goes into the hallway and returns carrying the evander holyfield cutout.) now, this is just a loan. okay? I am going to, I am going to want him back. so… (looks at him longingly) I am going to go now. (exits.) (pause) (entering) I am sorry, i thought i could do it and i can not! (she grabs the cutout and exits for good.)
have fun. oh wait, no, do not! i forgot i am totally against that now.
no, no, i am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to joey) hey, how do you sleep at night?
really?
(walking up to joey) hey.
well, i-i thought a lot about what you said, and um, i realilized duh, all right maybe i was a little judgmental. yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...
destiny.
yes.
okay. (one of joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) yikes! that one does not look very fulfilled.
you keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
so, what happens to the old guys?
why, do i have a feeling that is not as happy as it sounds? (joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) no! nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
(running up carrying a tree) wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! no, no, you do not want that one. no, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)
okay but that is why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it is christmas destiny, otherwise there going to throw it into the chipper. tell him, joey
well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours! ahhh.
all right y'know what, nevermind! everyone wants to have a green one! I am sorry, I am sorry, i did not mean to get so emotional, i guess it is just the holidays, it is hard.
oh, i was not even thinking about that.
this is the worst christmas ever.
oh! oh my god!
you saved them! you guys! oh god, you are the best!
oh, god bless us, everyone.
since when are you into swing music?
what is your job?
(wearing a veil) am i crazy or does this totally go?!
(to rachel) thank you rachel but, look at monica!
ooh, is that spelled with a ‘c’ or a ‘k’? oh my god! it does not matter; they are both great!
got it.
(coming back out) hey! rachel! come on!!!!
(hearing the signal) I am coming! I am coming! (she takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
okay! (runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) hey! (heads the other way and hears another blast.) what do i do?!! (she runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. she moves the dresses out of the way to find rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) what are you doing? (rachel does not stop.) did you find the dress? (rachel will not stop so phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
did you find the dress?
i—we got to get monica. (she starts to leave.)
oh my god!! (she grabs rachel’s hand and drags her towards monica.) excuse me! excuse me! (she is knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
i know. hand me a tissue. (monica hands her one.)
what?!
(gasps) does that mean carcass is available?
well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
yeah, swing music is so out.
yeah but the swing kings? y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—they just stop living.
i think david would probably want to hear a few lectures.
no, no, because, you know, he is been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he will die.
oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys want to share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there.
mike?? who is mike?
that is right! oh, yeah... well, I have totally forgotten about I am! ah! that is-that is... a blast from the past!
really, it does not mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time!
I am sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! I am crazy about david, and we are having so much fun together. why-why do i miss mike? that is-that is going to go away, right?
yeah.
you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone!
(shouts after david) oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling!
not joey.
yeah?
are you leaving "the supremes"? (monica and phoebe go to one side)
wow? really? that is fantastic!
oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let us just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it: "mike, do you take phoebe..." (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout "no! no!") you know, it is every girl's dream!
sure! look, ok, bottom line: i love mike... david! david. i love david. do not look at me that way, roseanne rosannadanna!
sure, ok, yeah.
oh my god, mike!
no, mike's here.
what are you, what are you doing here?
(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) no!
i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
david, I am so sorry, I am sorry.
yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
yes! (they hug)
well, on the bright side, now you will not have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) not you guys. you got it going on!
... and...?
all right, all right... I will play if we do not keep score!
nobody wins!
yeah, I am out.
mike, you do not know, you do not know what you are doing!
no idea! i though he was soft like you!
(picks up a coin from her bra) monica, you call it.
tails!
(smiling proudly) he was a lawyer!
(looking at mike) oh, yeah! (turning to chandler) are you telling me you... you are not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?
c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head!
(pointing at mike and shouting) i sleep with him!
(to mike) ok mike, better come back mike, better come back.
mike wins?
you can not do that!
ok, we are taking that paddle home, mister.
it is like watching porn!
she is made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
yeah well, we will see.
hey!
(sees the table) ooh, what a great table! where-where did you get it?
umm, a flea market?
wow! oh you can just imagine that this is where (she is opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
y’know? ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
how much was it?
500 bucks at a flea market?!
oh no.
a dollar?
ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
well, what period is it from?
yes, yes i do. god, oh it is just perfect! wow! i bet it has a great story behind it too. did they tell you anything? like y’know where it was from or…
(gasps) white plains. oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
(entering) hey!
okay. hey—ooh, cool sheets! (notices the sheet over the table.)
sure!
you bought your sheets at a flea market? ross come on, you got to loosen the purse strings a little.
oh sure! (she goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) noo!
what?!
ross, where did you get this?!
wow! oh my god, well if they have ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
well this does not even smell like opium.
oh ross, calm down, I will give you the 80 cents. (ross glares at rachel)
(entering) hey!
(sees ross) oh ross no. be careful, that is very old! okay? early colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
(gasps) another amazing find! wow! oh i bet this has a great story too!
ah!
yeah no, I am telling you rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—and i think that you should. you should, you should ask rachel to help.
oh, come on! i think he is ready to get rid of, what did you call it? the cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
no! i do want to!
yeah!
well at least i got these sheets for ross.
uck, look at this! pottery barn, yuck!
no! look-look! there is the coffee table they stole from us!
that fan kind of looks like ours. and the birdcage and the…wait a sec! this is our exact living room!
oh my god. this is where you got all our stuff, pottery barn! oh my god!
no-no-no, but i am mad! i am mad! because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! and it is all sitting up in my living room and all i can think about is how i do not have that lamp!
i can not! i can not! unless… well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if i did not buy that lamp?
but are you saying that you would move out if i did not buy that lamp?
okay then i do not have a choice! i have to buy that lamp!
but at least the apothecary table is real.
(entering) hey!
what-what is up?
really?! i looked into that. yeah, but, i mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. and, you would die!
so you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
oooh look! is not this adorable, ross let ben address mine!
hey! hey, did you get your invitation to ross’s wedding?
I am so jealous you are all going! i can not believe i never knew that you can not fly in your third trimester!
remembered what?
oh, it is so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune.
see, he is her lobster.
wow, it is like a dirty math problem.
oh, that is so unfortunate.
cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
you did not leave lipstick marks on the phone.
(angrily) bye-bye! (to ross) that is why i moved out.
i think on some levels she already knows.
okay, well maybe not on those levels.
why, nobody good?
oh, really?
so what are they doing?
(to monica, who is entering) hey, you are early.
I am just taking it to be re-wired.
no, no, mr. heckles no one is making any noise up here.
you do not play the oboe!
then I am going to have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.)
huh?
it is not in the apartment? (monica gives a ‘come on’ look) oh no. i can not believe this is happening again.
okay, enough with the third degree! i-I have, i do not live here anymore.
I am sorry, i-i-i-i do not live here anymore. i-i did not know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
that was supposed to be a good thing, i forget why. just listen, monica, i, do you know, okay, do you know, i could not sleep for like a month because i got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
yeah, i would have except i had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
okay, this is what I am talking about, this. i-i need to live in a land where people can spill.
aw, honey it is not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and i love you, and i want us to be friends, and if i keep living here i do not see that happening.
aww, good. (they hug) what?
no you are not, you are wondering which cushion it is.
oh, it is already closed, chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
oh no! why?
oh my god! i do not believe it! oh, you poor bunny.
aw! hey, do you think that susan person is her lover?
I am sorry.
aw, god ross. oh.(goes over and hugs him)
i know no, no, y'know you do not deserve this, you do not ross. you are, you are really, you are so good. (kisses him on the cheek)
and you are so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) and you are kind (kisses him on the lips)
huh?
okay, it is okay.
oh. (they start kissing again)
what?
what?
well, that is not something a girl wants to hear.
what?
you have chalk on your face.
oh, ross you are right, i do not know why i always thought this was real grass.
oh willie’s still alive!
oh my god! that is the creep that you are with at the statue of liberty.
hey, why do not you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
yeah that is great! next to that, chandler will not look so stupid.
(returning) hey you guys, hums while he pees just asked me out!
he is! but he is getting divorced—ross! maybe you know him.
you do not have to be back for a half-hour!
so you would not mind if he was dating someone else?
I am having a really good time!
ohh. no that is okay, he is a friend.
yeah, i… well y’know i-i mean i missed the-the semi-finals, so I would just be lost.
okay, do not freak out. I will go.
okay, i know. hold on. (she walks over to the couch.) hey ross?
yeah, umm that is whitney (points), kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?
well okay but i have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (she holds up the tickets that kyle gave her.)
hi ginger.
i do not have it!
ugh, okay sherlock! (hands over the key.)
all right, well i just wanted to say thank you though for diverting kyle’s ex.
okay.
(to ross) kyle’s ex-wife? you were supposed to divert her not date her!
watching ballroom dancing?
well look-look, okay ross, kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
like she is really mean, and she is over critical, and-and—no! she will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
and! she uses sex as a weapon!
you are still going to go out with her?!
well, did not you just hear what i said?!
(interrupting him) no listen to me! she is crazy!
you see? nothing is good enough for her!
hi.
so, how are things going with crazy? has she cooked your rabbit yet?
yeah well, maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
you think he is emotionally unavailable?
well, maybe he would not be she did not bring the office home every night!
yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing new year’s eve 1997.
(gets up and starts to leave) we want the last six years back!!
oh, I am sorry. is that annoying? and speaking about being selfish in bed, how is whitney?
oh he knows! (quietly) for the most part.
both of you together?
what about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
oh right, because you are so capable of change.
yeah, and y’know what? i do not give a tiny rat’s ass.
oh. y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
and y’know, even if they break up again, you would better not let him in your sad men’s club!
potato, potaato. (she is pronounces potato with the both the short and long as.)
ooh, let us see it!
you guys make a very attractive couple. (the camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that monica is posing with joey instead of chandler.)
i-i can not find anything that i want to eat! everything i eat makes me nauseous! I am telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! cake! (chandler shrugs, and phoebe grimaces.) no.
god! ooh! what is that smell? it is coming from the bathroom. ooh! (she goes to the bathroom.)
it is me. it is phoebe. listen there is something in here i want to eat, what-what smells so good?
(she smells his head) no!
yes. yes. yes. i can not believe it! the baby wants bologna! maybe he wants me to eat meat? i can not eat meat!
(angered by the rubbing) yes! i know! i know! yeah! so the baby is totally craving meat. this afternoon i tried tricking it, i made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? and i got nauseous.
being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
that is sweat. you throw up all morning, you will have that glow too.
ooh, yeah. then what are you going to put on top of that?
ooh yeah! then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
oooh, yeah. you are a genius.
oh my god!! the baby just kicked!
y’know it does not matter how much I am craving it. y’know why I am never going to eat meat? because it is murder, cold blooded murder.
i can not help it. i need the meat. the baby needs the meat.
yeah, totally!
yeah, but at what cost? six more months, three meals a day, I am going to eat like, y’know millions of cows.
what?
yeah.
joey, i can not believe you would do that for me.
pastrami.
hm-mm, corn beef.
okay.
six months.
not if i get there first.
yeah!
if she says no, can i have the ring?
if!
(with her mouthful) hi monica.
it is gone.
(to chandler) we are practically kissing. (makes a kissy face and winks at him.)
open bar?
i can do that for the kids.
y’know, you are 12 years older than her.
oh! oop! (hands him back the ring.)
here.
so now what is going on here?
no, i know what a silent is i meant, what is going on with your hair?
no! it is nice!
oh, hi. (they shake hands.)
hey you guys! look!
i got me some drinks!
open bar!
you just can not stand anyone else enjoying themselves can not you?
forget her! you enjoy this!! (pulls him back up and starts applauding again. joey waves and does a salute.]
well, just buy the damn boat! (she is still working her way through her tray of booze.)
I am just helping the kids!
because the more i drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
oh, okay.
it is a trip for two! (she gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she is wearing over her dress.) excuse me. (she walks over to table four.) excuse me, is the person who won the paris trip at this table?
oh, en chante. (she holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)
ohh, let me see it! let me see your hand! (chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)
i want to see what is in your hand. i want to see the trash.
eww! oh, it is all dirty. you should throw this out.
what happened?
well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…
good one! yeah.
look, she only suspects something okay? she does not know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
yeah! yeah! convince her that-that you are scared of commitment! convince her that you are a little coward!
no, you are too late!!! she already took out the trash!!!
i know, they are going to be so happy together.
not that often!
me too! so happy for them!
oh no! no god, definitely not jealous!
totally. I am like 90/10.
definitely!
what do you mean?
you mean a backup?
yeah, yeah i got that.
hm-mmm.
joey.
yeah!
yeah, i locked him years ago!
yep, we shook on it. yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
ohh, yeah. i think his exact words were… (she makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
well hey, it is just a backup.
of course i can! it is just good sense to backup your backup! look, I have already lost chandler!
i do not—look i do not know what you are complaining about now? you were both aware of the situation!
okay, this kind of back talk is not going to fly when we are married!
all right well let us see, ross is a good father, but joey has a boat—this is hard!
no wait! just—okay—just wait! you guys! wait you guys! do not make any rash decisions, okay? just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
(to rachel) I am talking about massages.
good!
left! (rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) thank you.
(reading) ross!
yeah absolutely! (they both switch.)
oh no wait no, this is wrong! ross is not here!
hey.
what were you modeling for?
you know, the asthma guy was really cute.
yes, and her boyfriend. but we are celebrating thanksgiving in december because he is lunar.
yeah. oh, can i come?
ooh, ooh! why do not we invite her?
oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we will all talk, and you will hear everything we say.
no, we were just laughing. you know, how laughter can be infectious.
look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
(stirring pot) ok, all done.
oh, I am sorry, oh, i just, i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
well, because then they would be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
almost never.
yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean.
ooh, ok, that is it. enough with the keys. no one say keys.
ooh.
ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. oh my god. he is not alone. ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal.
it is nice that he has someone.
ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
come on, you know, thanksgiving. ooh, you got the bigger half. what did you wish for?
what is it?
i know, i know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
hi!
oh, you are a paleonthologist, too! (pause) oh, ok, now, what do you think of ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
ah, ah.
yeah, i saw the article on your coffee table and i memorized the title to freak you out!
joey's having a party and he was not going to invite us?
and that horrible museum tour!
we know about your party joey.
hey!
monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where is chandler anyway? (looks around)
hey ross!
oh, what is the matter?
worse?
(still laughing) no. (points to rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just going to let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper?
go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she is looking to, you know, slum it with some average joe phd.
you are so much more than just brains! you are sweet, and kind, and funny...
ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch!
hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler.
what?!
i call their apartment!!!
it is so weird seeing ross and rachel with a baby. it is just so grown up.
look at you all grown up.
you know, i might know somebody. hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
done. oh good, really?
let us see! (opens her address book.) oh, you know who is great? sandy poophack.
yeah... all right, well that rules out lana titweiller
(enters) hey!
so how is this for our big double date tonight? (she is all dressed up)
ooh, great! just the reaction i was hoping for.
of course not! and you are going to love mary ellen. she is really smart and cute and funny, and i can not tell you how i know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. so tell me some about my guy.
come on, give me something. what is his name?
mike? okay! what is his last name?
all right, we will se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
joey, this is mary ellen jenkins. so, mike, how do you and joey know each other anyway?
wow, you guys go way back then. so what are you up to these days?
wow, that is great! i liked that better than the law thing, so...
you know, it is so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and I have never heard about you.
what?!
do you not know each other?
mike, let me ask you something. how many sisters does joey have?
joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
(to joey) you are unbelievable! i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
who are you kidding? (to joey) you just find some guy off the street for me? oh god! this is humiliating!
I am out of here (she leaves)
sure.
why did you go along with that?
that is true. (pause) well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
prove it.
that would not stand in the way of a true pianist.
you are really good! i play a little guitar myself.
uhuh.
well, like acoustic folksy stuff. you know? but right now I am working on a couple 'iron maiden' covers.
it is okay. go ahead, ask me out.
(to mike) oh, you just caught me off guard! yeah, that would be nice.
bye chandler.
okay, bye-bye! (pushes chandler out the door.) good trip! (slams the door)
if you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
ross, how about you. what would you give up, sex or food?
ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
oh, how cute!
oh, she looks just like a little doll!
oh, thank god, because that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) look, there is chandler. (he is on the street, talking to a woman)
oh! he is having an affair.
you know, I am always right about these things.
well, I am sorry but it is hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) see, there is something going on with them. look, he is getting into the car with her!
oh yeah? well, let us see. (she takes her mobile phone) ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. phoebe calls chandler)
oh, hi chandler. it is phoebe. uhm... i know that monica is working today so...(back to central perk) ...i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel.
(shocked) oh, well, it is a shame that you-that you miss the movie because we were going to see, you know, either "liar, liar" or "betrayal", or... "an affair to remember".
ok, then maybe it will be, uhm...
(glancing at her) what?
(to chandler at the phone) okay, we-we will talk to you later. okay, bye.
ok. quick. we got to find a cab and follow them.
(patting her bag) i got them!
so, should we tell her?
why? who would you seen him with?
tell me what you know!
all right. (she releases him). he is a good guy. you are right, he would not cheat.
well, look, whatever happens, we are here for you and we love you.
they went in together. so sorry.
what?
why do you have a realtor?
so you are going to move?
have you thought about what you would be giving up? you can not move out of the city, what if you want chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door?
wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers?
yeah, but so is this.
you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?
[looking outside the window] eww, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.
hey, it is your thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
(walks him to the kitchen) easy. step. how did it get on?
oh my god! monica's going to totally freak out!
well, of course it smells really bad. you have your head inside a turkey's ass!
ok, you guys, i do not mean to make things worse, but umm, i do not want to live with rachel anymore.
you are just so mean to each other! and i do not want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!
what else?
that is nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.
yeah, you do not want to live in westchester. that is like the worst of the chesters.
(to monica) you are going to be okay?
oh! these are the ones i was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)
hey you guys, guess what?
ohh, you and your ways. (she shakes the bell at him and sits down.) since it is christmastime. I am going to be one of those people collection donations.
(excitedly) yeah, i already have my bell and later on...i get my bucket.
yeah, yeah, I am going to be out there spreading joy to the people. i mean, last year, i spread a little joy but not really enough. so this year, I am going to do the whole city.
ohh, they gave me a great spot. right by macys. yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I am the only one who can sing "merry christmas" in 25 languages. (she smirks.) i lied.
happy holidays. feliz navidad. allo, and merry christmas. (a man put some change in her bucket.) ohh thank you sir. here is some joy. (she waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)
hey!
well, it is going okay.
oh, thanks!
wow!
is that a new swede jacket? it looks really expensive.
just get your nails done?
okay! thanks! happy holidays, here is your joy. (she waves her arm and spreads her joy.)
thank you! and happy holidays.
wait, you can not take the money out.
but, can not you leave the dollar? this money is for the poor.
okay, seasons greetings and everything, but still…
oh, I am going to give him something else besides joy, just… (she scowls at him.)
thank you, happy holidays.
now, that is trash. young lady, you can not… (the lady ignores her and walks off.) hey! stop that young lady, she donated trash!
hey!! (the bucket starts smoking.) the charity's on fire! help! (yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which phoebe grabs.) oh good! thank you, i need that. (she throws onto the smoldering fire. suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) whoa! what is that?! (she sniffs the cup.) (to the guy.) it is nine of the clock in the morning!
nobody! nobody respects the bucket! you would not believe what people put in here! look! (hands it to monica.) okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
does it look like an ashtray?
does it look like a urinal?
well, yeah! but I am not going to take anymore crap. okay? no more mrs. nice bucket!
yeah, I am going to go back to being street phoebe. yeah! oh but, y'know what? i can not go totally back because street phoebe really would not be friends with you guys. sorry. (leaves.)
oh whoa-whoa-whoa! wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. (the lady opens up her hand.) quarter. dime. lint? not interested in that. (she throws the lint away.) what is this? a canadian coin? get outta here! (the lady walks away.)
whoa-whoa-whoa! no drinks near the bucket! set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (the guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) and you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (her boss and a co-worker walk up.) hi bob! (the same old lady from before walks bye.) (to the old lady.) i thought i told you to get outta here!
what?!
that chick can not handle my corner.
fine. (she hands her bell to ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (the same old lady walks by again.) all right, I will give you one pointer. look out for that bitch. (the old lady.)
that is nice and we are done. tada!
yeah, chandler why do not you take a walk? this does not concern you.
no-no, we do it every year!
no, yeah, we never find them! she is always best at us that wily minx.
but we have to!
well then, you should look with us.
oh, that is it? (mimics chandler) a great idea!
ooh ooh, we have a live one!
ooh, who is it for?
uh-oh. she may be onto us.
yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they are all crap!
ohhh. thanks chandler they are great!
oh, okay, I am sorry, thank you for my azzz.
hey! look who i found!
y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and i thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? no! did not think so! okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!
hmm, how about my azzz?
what?
no, do not look directly at them!
alright, no, we could look at them!
oh, this one’s for chandler. here.
and the big one’s for me!
hee hee!
will you get us better gifts?
oh yes, i see what you mean. that look is priceless.
okay, okay. if i were omnipotent for a day, i would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...and bigger boobs!
(waking and startling them) oh! what what what! ...hi.
i got no sleep last night!
my grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they are both kind of insecure in bed. oh, and deaf. so they are constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they are having a good time. you have no idea how loud they are!
thanks.
i remember the day i got my first pay check. there was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
i worked in a dairy queen, why?
(to monica) look, look, i have elbows! (they scream.)
ooh! ooh! and i brought operation! but, um, i lost the tweezers, so we can not operate. but we can prep the guy!
you are just like jack.
no, jack and the beanstalk.
yeah, right! see, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. and then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. and he lived in a village, and you live in the village..
oh, see, jack did love the cow.
floopy?
oh, like that is a word.
oh, well... because.... you just... i do not like this question.
what?
i do not even have a 'pl'.
and-and a power tie?
big bird's friend.
oh, i want to see! lemme see! lemme see! (she runs up and takes the binoculars.)
ooh, wait.. wait, i see a woman.
definitely not his mother.
oh, wait, she is walking across the floor.. she is walking.. she is walking.. she is going for the pizza- (yelling) hey, that is not for you, bitch! (phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
yeah?
uh-huh.
oh! oh! oh! okay, fine, fine. now i do not feel so bad about sleeping with jason hurley.
you would already broken up.
a couple hours.
there he is! there he is!
right- where we have been looking all night!
oh no, let her stay out there. it is sweet.
so have you decided on a band for the wedding? because, y’know, I am kind of musical.
well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
oh, 19! we thought you said 90!
oh honey no, you ate it all.
check it out. okay, i can play this when the guests are coming in. okay. (singing)
if you would have let me finish, it goes on to say that he is probably not gay.
I am sorry, but i just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. check this out. (gets ready to play.)
really?! oh that is so exciting! thank you! thanks mon! oh but mon, if you touch my guitar again I will have to pound on you for a little bit.
okay. (she goes to get ready.)
you guys kissed!!!!! what does this mean?!! are you, are you getting back together?! can i sing at your wedding?
what a great night, chandler can not do it, these guys kissed… (points to ross and rachel.)
well yeah, that and chandler’s problem.
okay, so the plaza! okay, we will get us some mai thai’s, (to chandler) maybe no more for you though.
why?!
(she is strumming something) yeah? (joey nods yes.) okay, i think I will play it at the wedding.
well, i do not think monica is going to take this away.
would she?
okay, you said i could sing at your wedding so, I am just going to need a small deposit.
y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
oh, i see. (exits angrily.)
y’know, i do not really their permission.
yeah! and if you want to look 19, then you… you got to do something about your eyes.
they give you away! there is just-there is just too much wisdom in there. (joey nods in agreement.) just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
maybe just 10 minutes for you.
(singing, angrily)
(singing)
oh thank you.
now… (starts singing again) "who will perform the ceremony! who will perform the cer—(chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)—oh—oh! all right, I will pound on him in the morning.
oh good! (and there is general excitement.)
now was not joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
ursula! (ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) wait! err-err, it is me! phoebe!
wait a second! so, what is new with you?
what?!
huh. okay. well, I am really happy for you. (starts to walk away.)
really?
yeah. okay. umm, y’know, my friends are having a halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. maybe i could meet the guy you are marrying.
by the way, it is a costume party.
(looks down) no. but thanks. (walks away.)
ah, catwoman. so we meet again.
no, it is me. phoebe!
(to chandler) that is so you!
no wonder your pregnant.
okay, i will. but right after you tell me who the hell you are.
ursula’s fianc�e?
yeah.
yeah.
my mother killed herself.
no-no! that is okay, we will just start over. okay? hi! I am phoebe.
why are you looking at me like that?
okay. (hands him a napkin.) so, what are you?
(laughs) no i-i meant your costume.
i love the second grade!
yeah! it is so much better than first grade when you do not know what is going on and definitely better than third grade. y’know with all the politics and mind games.
umm, I am a masseuse…by day. (stands with her hands on her hips like a supergirl pose.)
no I am having fun. I am really—and I am really-really excited for you and ursula.
thank you.
(walking over) hey. ursula’s fianc�e is really sweet! he is a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. y’know normally y’know, i do not like really sweaty guys. but this one? i could just mop him up!
what?
no I am not! you are!
hello handsome. (sees ursula over her shoulder) oh god. (walks away in shame as they kiss.) oh look at you two. so when did you guys meet?
two weeks? that is it?
oh really?
huh? (ursula motions for phoebe to keep quiet.)
peace corps, really? (ursula motions, "i do not know.")
hi liar!
y’know the only reason he is marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
but they are not!
why are you lying to him?
you too. and ursula?! it was really nice meeting you tonight!!
hmm?
oh.
sure it does. yeah, yeah.
umm listen, i do not think…i do not think I am going to make it to the wedding. so i just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
okay i can not let you do this! she is lying to you.
she is lying! and i bet i can prove it. excuse me. (she grabs ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) okay. okay. yeah—not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (holds up her nametag.) okay, here is the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! not a teacher, a waitress. all right, here is her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. how old did she say she was?
oh, i almost do not want to show this. (hands it to him.) just remember I am a minute younger.
no. you are not, you are not stupid.
that is good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. just…you did it with the wrong person. (he looks at her.) what?
yeah, you should. (they shake hands.)
ohh, give him a kiss for me!
bye!
(after he is gone) i am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. i did not mean to be so out there. i am furious with him!
I am trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
look, i do not want to talk about it. okay?
you want to be on my list too? keep talking! has anyone seem my list by the way?
uh, it is a piece of paper and it says, "ross" on it.
ohh-oh, chilling!
oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
no! no, her cab! she probably will not be using it; you can drive it to las vegas.
oh hey joey! what is up?
yeah, I have been around.
ooh, if you take the northern route there is a man in illinois with a beard of bees. {okay, i must protest this, I have lived in illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
but on the southern route there is a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
oh, i know a way that you can decide! all right, I am going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
good, but wait. okay, all right, here we go. now i want you to relax. take a deep breath. clear your mind. (quickly) which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
who would you rather sleep with monica or rachel?
no thinking! no thinking! tie or ascot?
north route or south route?
bamn! there you go! huh?
oh, this guy again. (she ignores him.)
umm, no thank you. (she gets up and moves to the couch. they were at a table previously.)
thanks a lot! i just got that jerk out of my mind!
bye!
oh, I am sorry. i did not see you there.
well, if you do not know i can not help you.
well, i can not help you.
apology accepted.
uh-huh.
(quietly) bye, fat ass.
i do not know! i do not remember!
oh no, i am mad at you. i know that much. but, i am sorry about the fat ass thing. you actually have a very sweet little hiney.
no.
no that made me feel precious.
that game should not be played without my supervision.
what is in the bag?
i do!
ooh that is definitely chandler, joey, or ross. (thinks) or-or rachel!
hey, dude!
oh that is my grandma. (joey holds the box away from him.) and thanks joey she is having a really great time. (joey is happy now.)
okay joey? chandler's here, he was wondering… (we hear the dial tone as joey hangs up.) okay, i guess he ran out of change.
no, do not-do not say I am sorry with porn!
y'know what you should send him? a cartoon of cigarettes. because that why he could trade it for protection. no. that is prison.
uh-hmm.
fauna.
garfunkle.
you said i was boring--ohh!
oh my god, i remember now! we were playing chess!
oh, come on! yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? we were playing chess, you said i was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were cameron diaz! (realizes) okay, there is a chance this may have been a dream.
hey what are you guys looking at?
yeah, come to papa.
oo! is it for my birthday present?
yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just has not come yet?
'kay.
yeah, and what a great way to say, "i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
it is got to be better than that book. oo! like a crossbow!
wow, what is with all the negativity? you sound like monican't , not monican... (monica looks almost puzzled) ...monica. look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. do you want to be a caterer or not?
there you go, that is the spirit! okay! now, if you need money, i will lend you money, but just get moving!
okay! it is worth it, if it will get you moving. you have not worked in months.
yes, but I am doing this.
ooo, a crossword! can i help?
fine. but you can not help me develop my new universal language.
mon! I am so happy for you!
I will have one, please. plus my money.
oh. okay. oo, sorry i acted like a bank.
yes. did you settle the bill?
oh, look what we almost left. (picks up a coffee maker)
oh, all right. oh! look what we almost took!
but mon, you have to get our money!
i know, it is tough. you know what the first thing i did after my mother's funeral was?
pay the caterer! look, I have had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. it is either, you know, "that massage was not long enough, or, "i do not recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros are not big enough. bad little white girl!"
well, it seems like there were not any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
she seems fine now.
you did not get the money, did you?
no! hey, we are not leaving until we get paid! i do not know who she thinks she is! enough is enough! (phoebe goes into the living room.) hey, widow?
okay, widow!
excuse me. excuse me! (mrs. bukart stops singing) thanks. um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we are paid every penny. because you know what, lady? we are part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
good. (phoebe and mrs. burkart go into the other room, leaving monica with everyone staring at her.)
uh... yay!
yeah. I am a hard ass.
yeah. hard ass and wuss. we could fight crime!
okay!
yeah. oh! it will be like i have a wife in the fifties!
how can people do that?... (all but phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) oh, you guys, look! ugly naked guy got gravity boots!
oh, god, just do it! (grabbing the phone.) call her! stop being so testosteroney!
so, uh, why did not you say anything?
okay, they are just talking...
no, no actually, he is smiling.. and... oh my god, do not do that!!
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (rachel enters.) oh!
not a good day for birds...
oh my god! (walks to the window) go away! (gesturing.) stop looking in here!
you cook naked?
y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably did not get her messages yet.
how many beeps?
how did he take it?
sex in his chair.
where are you going?
radiator.

lusts of the flesh.

hey! I have got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone is names in them and inside is everyone is individual birth stone.
okay. okay! well okay, who do we know that is coming? me. are you?
hey!

uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (holds up $40.)
hi!
how are you? (the woman nods) good. (she goes over to another couple of women.) hi, thanks for coming.
thank you. (to the other woman) no? (she nods.) all right. (she goes to another pairing.) oh, it is so nice to see you.
okay. (goes over to rachel.) hey rach?
who the hell are all these people?
hmm, y’know there is another word for people like that. losers!
you were supposed to tell her!
fine, I will go call her.
and then for forgetting to invite you to it.
yeah. well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
we ruined everything.
sur-surprise.
cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
oh! no problem! i… (cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion barry white background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on, only this time phoebe is entranced. for more information on denise richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)
(in her head) say something! say anything! ask her out! she is not your cousin!
oh, oh! it is on again!
hey.
yes, it was! it was him! uh huh! (they all stare at her) okay, it was me!
well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. i mean, chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and i had not found a place to hide yet. i-i-i meant to tell you, and i wrote it all down on my hand. see, all of it. (shows him her hand)
yep, and that is why we do not invite you to play.
that is unfair. I will call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
what a sad little life she must lead. okay, ooh (starts dialing).
no, no, no, i know, i know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice) 'hi, this is katelynn, from phoebe buffay's office. um, is um, ann there for phoebe, she will know what it is about.'
(on phone) 'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office? estelle, no, i do not know what I am going to do with her. no. all right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
(on phone) 'right, well look, um, if joey loses this audition, that is it for estelle. i do not care! annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to monica) i need a pen. (chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she tilts chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)
oh, it is your audition from this morning. can i use the phone again?
(on phone, in 'katelynn's' voice) 'hi, i have phoebe buffay returning a page. okay, well, um, she is in her car I will have to patch you through.'
(in voice, on phone) 'okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) um, hi annie. (listens) fantastic! (to joey) you got it. (on phone) oh, okay, um, 'will he work for scale?' you ask me. well, i do not know about that, (joey clears his throat to signify yes) except that i do and he will. great, oh you are such a sweetheart. i would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) op, went through a tunnel.
it was really fun, i mean I have never talked on a car phone before.
oh, i do not know. i mean it was fun one time.
two?
okay, I will do it, but just these three, right
(entering) helloo! oh! (sees joey and starts to leave)
no it is not, sorry.
oh, joey! oh, okay, see i did not recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
yes! they called and you did not get it! okay, i mean you did not get it, I am sorry, I am sorry.
but they should not happen, you know what, you are, you are in a terrible, terrible business. oh god, i do not want to be the person who makes your face look like that.
oh, now you are sad and creepy, oh. you know what, i, I am sorry i quit, okay, i just quit.
not personal, really, well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent.
yeah. ooh god, there is that face again! see i can not do this job! i...
yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. yeah.
okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
no. they said you 'were not believable as a human being.' so, you can work on that.
um, the off-broadway play people said 'you were pretty but dumb.'
oh no wait, I am sorry, that is 'pretty dumb.'
oh.
yeah, no, i understand.
yeah. sorry. (she starts to leave)
what?
(in a coy tone) oh, you caught me. i am so busted.
oh, hey joey.
listen, i need to ask you something. ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
yeah. well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he would come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing iceman in the exercise yard just could not wait till monday.
no, and so there is no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, i would just really love it if you would do it.
yeah, you have... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. i mean, you have always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
so... what do you say?
oh, thank you. i hope... i hope you know how much you mean to me.
oh.
(her mobile phone rings) oh, it is my wedding planner. she is driving me crazy! (she answers) hello... hey, ok, stop screaming! ok? so, halibut. all right, so salmon, either way. i do not-i do not... it does not matter to me!
well, i do not care, so you pick!
uh-uh. ok. what time is that.
why, i must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
ok.
ice sculpture? that sounds really fancy! i told you i just want a simple wedding.
what harpist? my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums.
she did? why?
(looking angry) hey! she will shower when tibet is free.
hey!
okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
rehearse it!
so rach.
where is emma?
what is up?
uhm... well, they are not in the wedding.
I am sorry you guys but, you know, mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
oh! i though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
i do not have a fax machine.
i decided to pee.
oh no, no. i can not choose between you two! i love you both so much!
oh, i do not want to choose! it is (rachel is walking by). oh okay, wait. rach! listen i have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
well, there is a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between ross and chandler. so good luck with that.
all right, i guess I will have to find a new bridesmaid.
ok. hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. so tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but mike and i did not get off to the best start. (she reads a note). my friend joey and i decided to fix each other up with friends so i, i... (monica is twirling her hands in order to make phoebe speed up her speech) oh i... hum... i gave it a lot of thought and i fixed him up with my friend mary ellen who could not be here tonight because... (monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it is not important... she is in rehab. anyway, so, ok, joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike, only he did not have a friend mike so he just brought, uhm, my mike and, and (monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. ok, i want to take a moment to mention my mother, who could not be here...
and... moment's over! (rachel, joey and chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards monica but she just shrugs it off) so, ok, uh, i can forget that. i can forget that and uhm... (she is flipping cards skipping half of them) oh this is funny! oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... oh, ok, well, uhm, i (monica is miming cut). ok, ok, i, ok, i.... monica i can not do it like this! this is my wedding! okay, i do not want this (she mimes monica's when she was twirling her hands) or this (she taps her watch) or this (she mimes cut) ok? i just wanted a simple wedding! where my fiancee can go to the bathroom anytime he wants! (pause) you know what? you are done.
you are fired! (mimes the cut again) (pause and she raises her glass) cheers! (chandler raises his, smiling and monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)
hey!
oh, happy my wedding day to you!
oh, well that is ok. i think you and i will do much better if you are just... here as a bridesmaid.
wow, this is a lot!
you won awards?
sven i do not understand what you are saying! what is wrong with the flowers? lorkins? what the hell are lorkins?
listen, mike, if you were swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
right there! that is why I am marrying you!
no! we are going to do it my way. (listens) because your way is stupid! alright i got to go, i have another call, reverend. (switches calls) hello?
okay.
oh my god, what is it doing here?
(starting to panic) oh my god, everything is such a mess. why is this happening to me?
alright, wait, so what you are saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? are you, are you freaking kidding me!?
(to monica) help me.
i want you to be crazy bitch again.
(nearly in tears) please?
more than i want to get married.
(sounds scared already) about what?
i know.
what?
(turning to mike) what do you think?
me too! (turning to monica) monica, do you think we could do it?
oh, okay. hi new dad. (chandler waves)
uhuh, uhuh... oh my god! this is really happening.
oh, thank you.
i love you guys.
(nervously) okay.
oh wait, oh no. wait.
i do not care... I will be my something blue.
thank you.
na-ah.
when i was growing up, i did not have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and i always knew that something was missing. but now I am standing here today, knowing that i have everything I am ever going to need... you are my family. (she puts the ring on mikes finger)
oh wait, oh i forgot... and uhm... i love you... and you have nice eyes.
i do.
i got married! (everyone applauds) could someone get me a coat, I am freaking freezing.
hey!
you guys you really should get rid of those animals. they should not be living in an apartment.
all right. I am going to go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I am ready to have frank and alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
oh, they are just going to umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
okay everyone, think thick.
hi! wish me luck!
oh! i knew it! i knew it! i felt really thick this morning.
embryossss? as in, "more than one?"
five? okay, where am i giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
that is it! 25 percent? that means that is it is like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
okay, well y’know what, do not worry you guys, ‘because I am-I am going to do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
whoa!! that—okay, that is a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to dr. zane) so, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that i can do y’know just to like help make sure i get pregnant?
wow! you guys really do not know anything!
hello, tiny embryos. well, I am-I am phoebe buffay, hi! I am-I am-I am hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. you should know, that we are doing this for frank and alice, who you know, you have been there! umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. okay, and-and i promise that I will keep you safe and warm until you are ready to have them take you home, so… oh! and also, umm next time you see me, I am screaming, do not worry, that is what is supposed to happen.
uh-huh. (to the embryos) good luck.
(entering) hey!
umm, yeah, uh-huh, they are implanted.
well, freaked. ‘because it turns out that the odds are really sucky. and! this is frank and alice’s like only shot. like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
all right, I am going to go take a pregnancy test, right now.
well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than western medicine.
nope, not knocked up yet.
yeah, all right. meanwhile, I am going to do whatever i can to help this so, I am just going to y’know, lie it your chair, (she climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) y'know? yeah, good, I am let gravity y’know, do its jobs.
(singing) "are you in there little fetus?
oh. oh.
all right, i will. no, i will. but umm, y’know just remember that it is still really early, okay so, if it says that I am not pregnant, that does not mean that I am not going to get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so i do not go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
great. (goes to take the test.)
you guys! you guys! you are going to have a baby! they are going to have a baby!
okay, but this can not be good for the baby.
i hope it is you.
yes!!! oh!!
still.
yeah, I will do that. so who gets to be yours?
wh-why is that the best part?
aww, and good luck to you too! (to monica and rachel) what a nice lady!
hey rachel?
umm, when i get married will you be my maid of honor?
uh-hmm.
oh! well, if that is what you want…
but why does it even matter?!
because this one is now! and-and it is two of our best friends! who knows what you are going to marry!
(gasps) you would not! okay look, rachel i know you really want to do this, but i-I have never been maid of honor to anyone before! and i know you have done it at least twice!
and no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (rachel stops talking.) oh i guess that was it.
oh, thank you so much! (they hug.) okay.
oh i know.
see? this is exactly why you should not lie!
na-uh, i am!
because i cared enough to lie!
what are you talking about?
okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
(to rachel) well, it is better than us deciding.
no! coins hate me!
hey there, you handsome thing. (rachel and phoebe exit.)
ugh, what a kiss ass.
yes! your honor?
oh!
hey! do you want do you want a little taste of pheebs?!
okay, i can not believe that monica and chandler are getting married. i remember talking about this day with rachel while we were showering together, naked. (raises her glass and drinks.)
really?! i won!
the coins have finally forgiven me!
(running after her) rach, it is going to be okay! (to ross and joey) you guys are the best!
hi!
that is ridiculous rachel, we were all babies once. (rachel looks at her.) oh, you mean today.
oh yeah!
oh that is so sweet thanks.
ohh.
this stuff is great!
y’know rach, i think that, i think you should be monica’s made of honor.
because i think it means more to you.
its fine. i mean, this is something that you have been thinking about since you were what, 14? (she is referring to the halloween picture.)
(looking at the picture again) man alive!
well, we just decided that rachel is going to be your maid of honor.
(entering) hey. i need an atlas! i need an atlas!
i have a date with this diplomat i met while i was giving free massages outside the un and, i do not know where his country is.
oh!! that is my new thing. i figure bodies at peace, make peace.
ick-neck-tree-anis..... there is a ‘g’ in there.
in your atlas!
oh.
oh.
umm, well he is very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he does not speak any english, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
what is this?
me too. although this city is my home, so. so that is dumb what i said, do not tell him i said that. umm, you make something up. (mischa does so and sergei kisses her hand.) nice, (to mischa) thank you. this is me. here.
(to mischa) thank you, very much! oh! (to sergei) thank you!
(to mischa) okay, y'know what, you do not have to do that now. (mischa translates that to sergei) no-no-no-no!! not him, you do not! (mischa tells sergei he can proceed and steps away) well the moment’s over.
oh.
(pointing to the globe) see there it is right there.
yeah. but sergei said it took the germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
yeah. except for, y'know when you are on a date and you are getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.
(to monica) anyway, I am going out with sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? so that when we, it is time for our alone time, you two could split off. y'know, he is really, he is kind of cute.
hey, do not call him that! his name is spackel back harry!
(laughing and banging her spoon on the table) knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. um, could you please tell sergei that um, i was fascinated by what boutros boutros gali said in the new york times.
you did not say boutros boutros gali.
interesting.
okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell sergei that i really like his suit.
monica, can i talk to you behind my menu, please. (behind the menu) what are you doing?
yeah but, mischa is so interested in you, that sergei and i have not been able to say two words to each other.
that would be great. thank you.
oh, yeah, sure. i just hope you, hope you do not accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
well, tell him, apology accepted.
excuse me, but umm, is not he paying for your dinner?
plate! yes, plate.
see, we do not need them.
yeah.
ameri-can.
ameri-can. y'know it is a very hard language. let us do it again.
oh weird, chandler just told us he is got a conference there!
wait a minute! so when emily comes you are just, you are not going to see rachel anymore?
yeah that is better than my way.
(to chandler) can you hear anything?
ooh, madlibs, mine! (grabs it.)
i know it is le poo right now, but it will get better.
hey.
oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though.
ehh!!
come where?
okay, but try and get joey too.
oh, sure! (she gets up to leave.) bye ross! (whispering behind his back.) forever.
hey!
oh hey, monica, i heard you saw donald trump at your convention.
we are so stupid! do you know what is going on in there? they are trying to take joey!
the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe. and if you win, you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, "hi, phoebe!"
count for what?
so is joey going to have to give up the apartment?
well, how much do you think he needs?
why do not you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want.
and also, my birthday.
what a mean thing to say! i would never tell you it is not your birthday!
hey! so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
my god, i can not get a minute of peace around this place.
oh my god! monica’s just going to kill you.
well, what you are wearing is fine for that.
i have plans.
that is right.
okay.
hurry! monica’s going to make you pack! she is got jobs for everyone! now, it is too late for me, but save your selves! (the guys scramble for the door.)
you guys, we said we were going to have fun! come on, hey, remember the time… (she starts laughing hysterically.) you do not remember?
well, this does not have to be so sad though. y’know? maybe instead of just thinking about how much you are going to miss each other, you should like think of the things you are not going to miss.
come on, there is got to be something.
good! great! you can go first.
good that is a good one. okay, monica, anything? y’know? does rachel move the phone pen?
okay, good. there you go. does not anyone feel better?
great! it worked! no one’s sad.
yeah, i think it was better when you guys were sad. hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
hey! i call her!
yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations. (phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
well, one of you has to take the first step! and it should be you, because she is the one who is leaving. it is harder for her!
i know, i took it hard too.
hey, how are you guys doing?
okay, you guys. you guys i think i know what is going on here. okay, you guys… stop!! (they stop.) i know that, i know that you are acting mad because you think that it will make it easier to leave. but deep down you are still really sad. deep-deep down.
well, deep-deep-deep down!
then keep running. (they resume the chase.)
hey you guys, i do not mean to make things worse, but umm, i do not want to live with rachel anymore.
you are just so mean to each other! and i do not want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!
what else?
that is nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.
okay rachel, i can not wait to live with you! and you know what we should do? bring monica and then we could all live there together! we will have so much fun!!
oh that is right. you are still set on that?
hey!
well, okay, mike's taking a shower, which by the way there is no law against. and then we are going to grab some food, so if you want...
is that ross?
sounds like he is with someone.
oh that tart... floozy... giant...
yeah, you are right. this is none of our business.
oh, I am not going to do this, okay? I am not going to eavesdrop on my friend.
(whispering) rachel and joey! it is rachel and joey!!!
get over here!
we have got shoes being kicked off over here.
you got to hear this, it is great... it is like free porn! (chandler eagerly rushes over)
that is the door. he is gone...
oh, we are just... we are sad to go so we are just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) i love you... paradise hotel, golf resort and spa... (she walks away from the wall)
shhh... this is the listening side of the wall.
now, what is this?
oh no... have you thought about it how complicated this could get? what about ross?
hey, have you guys seen monica?
oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
who is day just got better? chandler!
uhm... you know, once we are in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
aaah... you are not good at this...
no, i think i can come over. it is saturday, right?
what?
why not?
you have a... you have a date? with who?
(let us go of his hand) you have... have a girlfriend?
for how long?
three months? okay... this is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you are going to keep seeing her?
oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you get home, maybe there will be a special delivery package waiting for you.
you know what, we are going to have sex. let us just leave it there.
hi, mike's place.
ooh, that was fast.
yeah, you can not do that! oh, come on mike, strap on a pair.why do not you just tell her that we got back together. you know, women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. just f.y.i.
her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
(stunned) i... I am phoebe.
enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)
okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... does not really matter who is right or wrong. point is... I am going to take off.
alright... susie, can i call you susie?
yeah, i can not say that. uhm... susie, I am going to be straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he is very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
well, i do not...
nothing, there is nothing wrong with you.
damn it woman, pull yourself together! have some pride, for the love of god.
okay, not a fan of the tough love.
but he did not really know, you know. he was not planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me...
look, precious... mike's not worth this. you are an attractive, intelligent woman and let us face it, mike's kind of a wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was going to break-up with you on your birthday? and, i do not like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
you are welcome!
so good!
i-I am sorry it was not one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
(entering) hey.
whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
oh no, how?
which one?
no, which one? the right or left? because the left one is lucky...
why would you leave your belgian waffle in the hall?
okay, thank you, mr. heckles. (they move off)
oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
oh my god. you would put that poor little creature in jail?
yes, but there is not always time!
dun-dun-duuuur! sorry.
marcel?
marcel?
oh-my-god!
something just brushed up against my right leg!
oh, it is okay, it was just my left leg.
yeah! oh, c'mere, marcel! oh, marcel, c'mere!
yeah, think so. oh! (she notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) huh. (sways back) whoah.
oh, this is so intense. one side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
nope.
oh. oooh! ooh! ooh! (she stands up and starts to dance around) ooh! my butt cheek is waking up! oooh! ooh!
oh you made it!
(looking at the clock) oh wow, three hours and still no baby. ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
sure! what?
oh, this is fun.
yeah. (pause) why are not you with rachel?
but y’know what? it just seems that you two belong together.
right. and with who again? (ross exits.)
i know!
oh, it ate your money?
all right, I will see you downstairs then.
all right.
hi.
oh down please. (the guy tries to reach the button, but can not.) i-i hate to be a ball buster can i just do it? (she pushes the button.)
sure! i feel so bad for you; i broke my leg once too.
well, it is a long story. it is kind of embarrassing. let us just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (the guy laughs.) how about you?
oh.
uh-huh, yeah.
oh yeah! i-i would like that.
wait! what?! no!! elevator!! no!
(to the nurse) excuse me? could you help me with something? the patient I am looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. and umm, he is like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
oh yay! great! okay, what room number is he in?
hands.
thank you. (starts to exit.)
(coming back for joey) no! (grabs joey and drags him away.)
ooh, this is it! (looks in the window.) oh, that is him! that is him!
wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
no not you, dr. drake remoray. you can ask him questions and see what is he like. people tell doctors everything.
but lately all the guys i meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
what else? what else?
oh. ah-uh.
oh.
enter pheebs.
okay I have got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
somebody went to college. wow. (cliff gets uncomfortable) what is it? I am sorry. (she moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
oh, I will get it. (she gets up and grabs a spoon.)
relax, it is not like we are forking.
y’know what? this one is. (eats another spoonful of pudding as cliff sees something on tv.)
huh. okay, mr. perkazet.
cliff, do you really believe that a character from a tv show was here in your room?
okay. okay. i—okay umm…this…i-i sent my friend joey in here to find out stuff about you. umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. a lot better than I am coming off right now.
you are right, that was wrong. I am sorry. I am so sorry. it is just that i liked you so much. can we just, can we just start over?
uh joey, we are trying to dial down the crazy.
umm, look we do not, we do not really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. and i do not know about you but that does not happen to me a lot.
can we come in?
hi!
oh, she is so beautiful.
okay, my turn. my turn. (joey hands her to phoebe.) oh! you are so cute! oh, i could squeeze your little head! (pause) i will not.
ohhh. (hands her back to rachel.)
oh, wait a minute it is not going to be baby girl? i thought that was so original!
yay!
is she in there?
oh!
i just can not decide who she looks more alike, you or rachel?
I am sorry, for the last time, why are not you two together again? (silence from ross.) no, i know. i know, because you are not in that place. which would be fine, except you totally are.
yeah that is true. yeah, you love her. you always have. you have a child together. there is no right answer.
i know. i know. i know. i know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
right. (pause) or you might get everything you have wanted since you were fifteen.
(she enters) hey...
oh, I am just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) huge engagement ring!
well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
thank you! (to rachel) oh, and i have something for you!
it is, yes, my little black book. it is got the numbers of all the guys I have dated.
i would, but you are the last one.
oh, my first love!
dead. (everyone is a bit upset) oh, it is ok, no, he was old, yeah! and he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at omaha beach.
(proud of herself) oh yes, they are.
(looking at monica entering) hey!
well, i told you i had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so mike could move in.
yeah.
oh, it is so hard to get rid of stuff! did you and chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
a bunch of stuff. and the worst one... he wants me to get rid of gladys.
yeah. i really hate to give her up. oh, i know!! oh, you should take her!
why, you do not like her?
really? you think?
ok, I will fight for her. ok! oh, wait, oh i just realized... if i do that, that means you do not get her.
hi! sorry, I am late.
no, he really hates it. but he is going to let me keep my box of human hair! so you got to pick your battles. but the good news is, gladys is yours!
oh, she is that work of art i made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
oh, i did not know you wanted her too!
girls, girls, stop, ok? we will flip a coin. heads, she is rachel's, tails she is monica's. (she flips the coin). tails! monica, she is yours!
(smiling from ear to ear) well, gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')
(genuinely excited about it) yeah, yeah! and you can get rid of that french poster.
really? it does not have anything coming out of it. or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
hey! (there is a pause)
you guys! you guys! you do not have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. one of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) whoever does not get gladys gets glynnis. (rachel and monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
i knew it!
who is singing?
ewww! oh! it is the mattress king!
hey!
yeah, i can not say croissant. (realises) oh my god!
ugh! i do not know monica. it feels funny just being here. i mean if you buy a bed from janice’s ex-husband, that is like betraying chandler.
(sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) hi. y'know in england this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) woo!
eh, monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, chandler’s your friend... (hops onto the bed) oh! oh my god! aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
hey! ooh! how was teaching last night?
ooooh, nice.
oh, yay!
oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)
okay.
oh, do i have a middle name. all right monica velula geller. it is that bedroom there. (points to monica’s room)
yeah, so please, please, please, do not say anything to chandler.
is that a problem?
oh, hey, hey nick the boxer let us see what you got. all right ya, put ‘them up. come on. (they start shadow boxing)
yeah, well i had to learn, i was staying at the y and some off the young men were not acting christian enough.
oh! oh! oh!
wow! and I am a vegetarian! all right, all right, well I am sorry, we will put some ice on it.
‘kay, put your head back.
all right, i have ya. oh god.
oh, it is the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
I am, I am freaking out! monica kind of trusted me with something and she should not have! all right, i have not lived here in a while, so i have to ask you something. does monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
i am soo dead. (goes to monica’s room)
is not it cool! varoom! varoom!
i know, you must have won like a contest or something!
I am sorry, okay, i-i was not looking, and the store says that they will not take it back because you signed for it...
when i was you! y'know what, it is all joey’s fault, ‘because he left his nose open!
it is monica’s bed. what?
so. this has always been monica’s bed, what you are just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
well, if you really, really want it, then it is okay.
look everyone, it is the spirit of thanksgiving!
speaking of christmas, umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret santa, and then we each only buy one gift. and-and there is the added mystery of who gets who.
i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh!
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it is like impossible to get her something she likes. come on, let us trade!
ohh.
you do not have to do that, ross and joey are not here, you can watch the parade if you want.
god, what happened?!
open it up, let me see.
ooh, god it looks bad.
honey, you have got to go. what is his office number?
(on phone) hi! yeah, I am calling on behalf of monica geller’s eye, and is um, is richard burke in today. (listens) (to monica) he is out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
yes! she is very excited about that.
this is so cool, ‘til monica gets back, it is like I am head chef and i get to make all the decisions. (she looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)
okay, get out of my kitchen!
all right i… i got to call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
yeah, i can see where I would be your best shot but, no. I am sorry, but i think it is twisted.
yeah, but monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "that is not how your dad used to do it."
oh, I will get it. (goes over to the door.)
oh, he-he can not talk right now.
he is just trying to show joey how much he means to him.
they were threefold.
oh, she sees him! oh, they are hugging!
oh, there they are!
all right, get a room.
