(she bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) oww!
I am fine, I am fine.
yes i am!
look, I am fine. watch. (she picks up an aspirin between her toes) look at that. (she lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.) whoa-whoa!

(with a hurt expression on her face) okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
(she drops the brush) y'know what? i cannot do this with my left hand! would you please, help me with this too?
(taking the brush back) okay. let us use this brush. (hands him another one.)
yeah.
careful. light. okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. okay? just sweep it.
oh-ho!
hey! that is just poking me in the eye!
okay, just sweep it.

okay, now make it even, ‘because we do not...
we do not want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
since when, since when do you think i do not wear enough of this?
blow it.
sophisticated like a hooker?

sure, I will just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
oh wait, ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
okay. okay, great! umm, okay, just turn around.
i do not want you to see me naked!
yeah, but that was different. y’know? i mean, we were, we were going out then, now i think it is weird.

(entering) hi!
oh my god! (notices the boots) oh monica! those boots are amazing!

(pause) he is talking to the baby.
okay. well, i got to go you guys. I will see you later.
bye. (she gets up to leave but is stopped by joey)
hi.
no, forget it! no way! i am not sending anymore ralph lauren clothes to prison. it is a waste.
i guess i can talk to one of my supervisors…
really?! oh my god! I am successful!
yes! I would love to! have her come by the office.
yeah.
hi monica!
hi boots.
ahh…
well-well you can give them to me! i have not felt my feet in years!
oh joey, I am hardly a…
right! hi dina!
nice to meet you. (they shake hands.)
okay. all right dina, well let us talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. let us see, there is design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. uh, there is-there is sales, which is great because you get to travel…
(stunned) and there is marketing…
honey, it is going to be okay. he is been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that is what the meatball sub is for. (she gives dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
okay.
honey, why do not you sit down? dina has something that she wants to tell you.
joey…there is something that you…should know. dina?
(to dina) now! give him the sandwich! give him the sandwich! (she quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
what?! dina…
i know.
what college was that dina?
joey, what are you doing?
oh joey this is crazy!
all right joey! that is enough! (grabs him and pulls him away from bobby and dina) listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it is not legal. okay? they-they do not have a marriage license, they do not have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
you are supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.
heyyyyy! contraceptives are not always effective! (to bobby and dina) right?
oh, come on kids! a little help here!
joey, just because they are not getting married does not mean this is going to be a disaster. maybe they have a plan!
hey, now wait a minute! i get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! now come on bobby, why do not you tell us a little bit about your band?
(to dina) really? (nods her head at bobby.)
oh excuse me! am i ruining my life?
so forcing her to marry bobby is going to make that happen?
okay bobby, why do not we just come over here and let them have a little moment. (drags bobby away from joey and dina.)
no! seriously! what is wrong with you?!
yeah, what?
yeah-yeah, did-did not you use to have a pair? they were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…
yes!
oh, y’know what you should get ‘them? one of those little uh, portable cd players.
yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means joey.
y’know joey, i could teach you to sail if you want.
yeah! I have been sailing my whole life. when i was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
what?! what?! he was trying to cheer me up! my pony was sick.
that is the coast guard.
joey, just ignore the boats all right? we are not finished with the lesson yet.
okay, I am just going to go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
oh, okay. is that what you want to do? you want to go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? okay, let us do that sailor joe. quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what is this called?
wrong! how do you get the mainsail up?
no. what do you do if i say we are coming about?
time’s up, now your dead.
okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. am i getting through to you sailor?! (she punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
do not just say yes! this is not a game, joey you can really get hurt out here. okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
(laughing) yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
i do not know. y’know, they did not get us anything.
well hello! so, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?
why not?
what? i was just trying to teach you.
excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you could not move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
look joey, I am sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but i got to tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher.
well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
yeah, i did not want you to get hit by the boom!
all right, y’know what? i-I am sorry. i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
i will not boss you around.
and, I will be nice.
and—joey!
okay joey honey, you are doing really good! all right, now I am just going to need you to step to the port side. (joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) remember? remember how we talked about the port side?
right?
it is left sweetie, but that is okay sweetie, that is a tough one.
okay, go to the left. (joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) the left!
(yelling) just sit over there!! (points to the port side.)
no! no-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
okay joey, we are luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (the mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
joey, come on! we just went over this! (she does it instead.)
(angrily) no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
what do you mean you quit?! you can not quit!
because you are not finished yet and i will not have it! greens do not quit!
oh my god, wait did i—i just said greens do not quit did not i? (pause) (angrily) did i just say greens do not quit?!
no! no! no! I am not yelling at you, I am just yelling near you. oh god joey, ohh I am my father. oh my god, this is horrible! I have been trying so hard not to be my mother i did not see this comin’. oh, joey, I am sorry. I am so sorry. i just wanted you to learn.
really?
awww…
left.
well joey, i hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
ohh we are not sailing.
all right. (she does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) hey-hey-hey!! (sees what is in the cooler.) sandwiches!
(hands him one) here you go.
oh wow! (she takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)
ohh, sorry.
ohh whoops.
(entering) oh good you are still here!
i want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (hugs monica.)
and i also wanted you guys to know that i am telling the father today. (they all look at her expectantly) what? what? what?
how?! how do you know?
oh, i so wanted ross to know first, but I am so relieved you guys know.
i know! (they hug.)
(breaking the hug) you are all going to be aunts and uncles.
okay. great! so now that you guys all know you can help me. give me some advice on how I am going to tell ross!
well i was going to tell him that I am-I am going to have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
yeah but how do i start? i mean, what is-what is the first thing that i say? (they all pause to think.) okay great! thanks. (she starts to leave.)
(seeing him) hi!
hi. (he helps her up.) umm, i think there is something that we really need to talk about.
you do?
(warily) okay.
(confused) what?
seriously. what?!
okay, y’know what? can i, can i talk now?
(touches his knee) I am pregnant. (ross stops.) ross? (ross is staring off into space.) ross? (ross is still frozen) okay, whenever you are ready. (sits back and opens her magazine.) and you are the father by the way—but you got that…
(closes her magazine) can i get you some water?
ross, there is no pressure on you. okay? i mean you can as involved as you want. (ross nods.)
i know. i know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
they do!
okay ross come on let us just forget about the condoms.
listen, y’know what? i was really freaked out too when i found out…
y’know what? let us, let us talk later.
okay, y’know maybe i should come back… (starts to leave.)
(stops) okay.
(sighs) if i said i was, would you judge me?
okay. (the nurse exits.) oh man, i swear if they sold these at pottery barn…
(shocked) hi!
uh-uh-uh, right now? because I have kind of got an el fresco situation going on over here.
okay ross that is fine, but can you please stand near my head?
okay. head ross! head ross! head ross!
what married?
what, because that is your answer to everything?
yeah, maybe if you are in love. but ross, we are not in love, are we?
excuse me?
what?!
i can too eat by myself!
when certain people leave the table and i am not finished!
oh please, you inhale your food!
oh no dr. long, please come in. this is ross, he is the father.
i do need you! i need you to stand near my head!
wow. there it is, i see it.
okay.
i do not see it!
i can not see it!
i know, i lied! i did not want her to think i was a terrible mother! i can not even see my own baby!
oh. oh, it is beautiful. i see it now.
no, i do not see it!
yeah.
that is it? well i saw that! ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
wow! i can not believe that is our baby.
hi.
oh, everything went great.
oh no, i know i could not see it either at first, but it is right umm… (starts to cry) ross, i lost it again.
(freaking out) oh my god!!
you may need to use this year to teach ben about phoebe.
(to monica) did you know he was in there?
(entering) hey!
drums?
(stopping at phoebe’s entrance) ha!
joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
what are you talking about? i love them! (looks into the cage) yeah, i had a tarantula when i was a kid. but it-it died, because my cat ate it. and then, then my cat died. but joey, is not this cool?
oh, is not that adorable? joey is afraid of the tarantula.
what? wait-wait a minute, what? phoebe, what is the matter?
and that makes you angry because…
where did you get that?
phoebe?
did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
it would not have mattered anyway, phoebe, you and i are, are going to live together, we are roommates; that is the deal.
oh, it is so much more fun with you.
we did!
oh, i would love to!
good, good, good, good, good. (she runs to the drums and gets the sticks)
(with the sticks in her hands) um... (she goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) done!
oh wow! look at this place!
(yelling from another room) oh my god!
(returning) okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
and remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
do you really not know where I am going with this? (phoebe nods, "no.") it left! it is one huge room!
see?
you can not, because of the new skylight!
so what should we do? should we start looking for a new place?
oh yeah? startin’ to feel her again there are we?
pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
phoebe, it is okay. i like living with joey.
oh please, i hate packing, it is closer to work, and we do have fun. although, I am really going to miss living with you.
i know. (they hug.) oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? listen, I am gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair?
(entering with phoebe) hey!
(seeing the collection of characters.) wow! it looks like the easter bunny’s funeral in here.
oh.
i got it!
its back in cage!
joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
(entering) joey! you never going to believe it: she called.
(enthusiastic) you got it!
your agent called. you got that audition.
yes.
yeah, and lennart haze is starring in it…
(disbelieving) you saw that?
oh, yeah. oh, i loved him in those cell phone commercials.
oh, anything yet?
joey, that was formula.
okay, first of all, that is stupid and second of all, I am not allowed to talk to ralph.
what?!
so?
oh, good point.
(to joey) happy new year, joey!
but your divorce is not even final yet.
op, look! claire forgot her glasses! and she is going to be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, i hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I am talking about.
i do not gossip!
well, maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y'know kind of like a public service, it does not mean I am a gossip. i mean, would you call ted kopel a gossip?
what? they were like this!
i did not! even when i found out…umm, all right, well let us just say i found something out something about someone and let us just say she is going to keep it. (goes into her room.)
i think they are very nice.
awful, absolutely awful. (plus other negative comments from phoebe and monica.)
(entering, singing) "baddest man in the whole damn town."
arghh!! (she quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
(entering) joey, do you have a minute?
oh, joey, i have such a problem!
okay. okay. okay. joey, i have got to tell you something!
oh my god, it is so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
yes! yes! yes, you do want to know! this is unbelievable!
what? what secrets? you know secrets? what are they?
i know, i know! i just can not keep this one in, so i pick up the phone… (joey in a childish attempt to not hear what rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that joey's not going to listen, and as she exits chandler walks in and sees joey in his current state.)
that really is something; that is really cool.
good luck, honey!
hey, uh, joey?
remember that big thing i was going to tell you about?
I am not going to tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. right?
(quietly) yeah. well. (pause.) hey uh joe, would mind going over to chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
yeah!
do you know something?
i might know something too.
oh no, i can not tell you until you tell me what you know.
well then i can not tell you what i know.
all right, how about i go over there and i will walk into chandler's bedroom and i will see that thing that i think that i know is actually the thing that i think that i know! (note: kudos to ms. aniston on the delivery of that line. she said it very quickly and did not screw up a word. try it yourself, it are not that easy.)
and you know!!!
chandler and monica?!! oh, this is unbelievable!! how long have you known?
ohhh, yeah, me too.
hey, mon, i was just doing the dishes!
oh! it is you. (she stops doing the dishes.) hi.
yeah, yeah, i was just about to take a break anyways, so…
oh.
yeah. yeah. definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I am okay.
yeah.
oh, that is sweet.
(breaking the hug) uhh, hang in there?
i mean maybe you did not hear about a serious relationship called me and joshua?
oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. oh no, those were four great dates.
yeah. oh, yeah. and i mean, the connection, i mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…
i know is not it? it is like I am right there with joshua.
you are right there with emily. and it is y’know, it is kind of like…. it is a tie! well, i got to get, i got to get back to the dishes.
oh yeah? fine.
oh yeah, no, what is that?
that would be great!
(to the closed door) hang in there. you hang in there. (gives him the raspberry.)
no, just singing. (does a little song.)
(entering) hi!
handling it? what do you mean, handling it? there is nothing to handle. now, maybe i would have a problem with this if it was not for me and joshua. y’know, they are not going to get married anyway!
come on! they rushed into this thing so fast it is ridiculous! i mean, they are going to be engaged for like what? a year? and somewhere along the way, one of them is going to realise what they have done and they are call the whole thing off. I am telling ya, you are going to be dancing at my wedding before you are dancing at there is.
why not?
nothing.
in a month?
you mean, you mean 30 days?
from now?
well, that is great.
hi!
ohh, nothing, i just wanted to see you. see you and hug you. (hugs him) see you.
yeah! (she sits down) sit!
I am more than okay, i am really, really happy! want to know why?
‘because i am really happy about us. i think we are, i think we are so on the right track! y’know? i mean, i think we are working, i think we are clicking. y’know?
yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where i—that i think we need—we would need to work on; i-i would think it was we are just not crazy enough!
well, yeah, right, y’know what? yeah, you are right, i mean, we no, we have our fun. yeah! but if (grunts uncomprehensively)……i mean, i mean like craaaazy! y’know? okay, all right. this is going to, this is going to sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. umm. ugh. what if we got married?
oh, i know, i know, it is-it is so, it is so totally like, "whoa! can we do this?" y’know, i mean, but i mean it just feels right! do not you think? it does! i mean, it just feels right, do not you think?
(entering from her bedroom) well, i just called joshua…
well, i did my best to convince him that I am not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I am just going through a hard time.
well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. ugh. i feel blue.
yeah, maybe, but i do not think i even care. i do not think he is the one I am sad about. y’know, i know that i said that i am totally okay with ross getting married, but as it turns out, i do not think I am handling it all that well.
and i-i am just trying to figure out why.
well, yeah, y’know how ross and i were on again, off again, on again, off again? i guess i just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
three people. joshua’s not going to be there.
uh, well, i think, i think he broke up with me.
well, apparently he scares easy.
it is okay. sometimes, things do not work out the way you would thought they would.
(breaking the hug) oh, hey, do not you have to go pick up emily?
yeah.
yeah! i got my girls.
ugh. (she goes over and lays her head on phoebe’s lap.)
what?
y’know, i got to tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
oh, okay! (she goes to answer the door.)
I am not going to marry chandler!
okay, you guys, just relax. (she goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) i doooo. (sees that it is joshua, not chandler that knocked on the door.)
oh, wait, joshua! joshua! (pause) (comes back inside) yeah, well, that oughta do it.
oh, you are welcome a million.
(softly) oh my god.
whoa! what?! why?!
here?! now?!
well, can not you tell her that you are not in the mood?
(interrupting) whoa-ho.
i do not know.
oh, making it worse!
oh, was it awful?
i wrote you a letter.
(handing him the letter) it is just some things I have been thinking about. some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, i just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
well, I will be waiting for you, just come up when you are done.
(coming down the stairs) hey! (ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) what happened to you? why did not you come up?
you just finished?
so umm, does it?
does it?
what are you talking about, ross, you just said that you read it twice! look, y'know what, either it does or it does not, and if you have to even think about it...
are you sure?
i know. (hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)
how was the beach?
ooh, i have to go pack. (gets up to do so.) it really does?
all right, that is it, you guys! what happened out there?
oh-hooo, i missed you.
ooh, i was soo nervous about that letter. but the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you have grown. y'know?
you have! ross, you should give yourself credit. i mean my mom never thought this would work out. it was all, “once a cheater, always a cheater.”
ooh, i just wish we had not lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
yeah! you and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
what?!!
you fell asleep?!
y'know i can not believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you are at home on saturday nights playing scrabble with monica!!
(to monica) sorry!! (to ross) i just feel bad about all that sleep you are going to miss wishing you were with me!
and hey! just so you know, it is not that common! it does not happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!
all right! who is are they? who is are they?
well, get  them out of here! what is wrong with you?
(waving them in his face) take  them! (joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.) joey, you can touch them! they are your underwear.
hey, pheebs!
what are you reading?
honey that sounds like fun.
okay.
oh, i read that in high school.
(to phoebe) sorry I am late, but i left late.
so pheebs, what is the book about?
well yeah, but then i remembered i started it and there was this pep rally and i was, i was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?
umm, well i would have to say that it is a, it is tragic love story.
oh-oh-oh, symbolism! and uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which i think is-is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff's character.
well, honey that was pretty obvious.
be-because i did not want him to think i was stupid! i mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
joey, is what she just said umm—oh my god. (looks around the room.) you were actually going to… (chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (rachel stares in shock.)
and with chandler in the next room. what are you, what are you sick?
hi!
(sitting down) so umm, what is this book about?
well, i was going to, but i accidentally read something else.
vogue! hey, so tell me about this jane eyre woman.
come on phoebe! do not be such a goodie-goodie!
a cyborg?! is not that like a robot?!
uh, thank you phoebe. umm, well, what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
(entering, angrily) ugh, that was so embarrassing! i can not believe you let me go on and on like that!
that was not funny!
phoebe, come on! what is the big deal? i thought this was going to be something we could do together! y'know, i thought it would be fun!
ohh. oh, so you really wanted to learn. yeah, y'know, pheebs i just wanted to have fun. ohh, you know who you should go with?
(sees the picture) oh my god! that is monica!!
you get away from me!! you sick, sick, sick, sick-of!!
joey has got a secret peephole!
yes! he has a naked picture of monica! he takes naked pictures of us! and then he eats chicken and looks at them!
look! (shows ross the picture.)
well, what is the truth?
monica, is this true?
okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
and the video camera?
hi joey, how ya doing?
huh, yeah i guess we are roommates now.
I am not paying for half of that! I am only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
that refrigerators do not live as long as people.
you are jokin’ right?
thank god you are pretty. (exits.)
hey!
do you guys know any cute guys?
anyway, there is this big charity ball this weekend and ralph lauren bought a table, so i kind of have to go…
i do not know, something either trees or disease—ralph mumbles a lot.
yeah! it is weird. but the thing is need to find a date.
well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
oo! when is her birthday?!
well, y’know it is just been so long since I have been to chuckie cheese.
hey! you guys umm, i want you to meet sebastian.
we just uh, we just met at the newsstand. we both grabbed for the last field & stream. (chandler’s shocked.) what? i read that.
oh yes! thank you! (he does so and rachel sits down on the couch.)
(shocked) what?
you found me a guy?
well, y’know what though you guys? i really appreciate that but i think I am just going to take sebastian to the charity.
oh, thank you.
what are you guys doing?
oh, but y’know, no, you did not give me your phone number.
i cannot believe you guys! he was really nice and he left because of you!
all right.
yes, I will meet ‘them.
hi!
oh…
i do not know. i know i do not work late tomorrow night.
what?
well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.
i—ohh! (moves over and let us eldad sit on the couch.)
yeah?
oh, hi.
yeah?
oh-okay, but pheebs?
I am just sort of in the middle of something.
okay, y’know what? maybe i should go!
yeah, I am good.
no-no! do not dance for me! please? do not! (she gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) what is the matter with you guys?
i… am i the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I will tell ya who should be embarrassed! it is you guys! come on! this is ridiculous! thank you very much, but i do not need you to get me a date!
i am still talking!! and then you chase away the one guy that i actually liked! i mean, no offense to you guys. really! i mean (to patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (he nods) and-and y’know—(feels eldad’s hair)—wow! you do have very soft hair! but i would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! good-bye! (grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to eldad) now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
thank you! (storms out.)
oh that is all right! y’know, i ended up having a really good time. y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
i want to say a disease.
huh. all right.
oh-oh professor geller.
oh, ross, relax. it is probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
what, it is ok when chandler does it?
hi, i thought you might like some ice chips.
and if you need anything else, i—(notices the handsome dr. franzblau)—do not believe we have met. hi. I am, uh, rachel green. I am carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
oh, that is funny!
hey.
yeah, well, it is an important day. i want to look nice. um, has uh dr. franzblau been by?
well, where is he? he is supposed to be here. (pause) what if the baby needs him?
yeah, why?
no, honey, they are not, but do not worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
ok?
(to dr. franzblau) ok, so anyway, you were telling me about paris, it sounds fascinating.
(anxiously) no, no, not at the moment, no, I am not. are you?
right, yeah, I have heard that about cute doctors.
oh.
I am a waitress.
(getting the point) yeah. gotcha.
ok. that is fine. (takes her earrings out)
yeah, honey, they would not miss this.
oh, god, i can not believe one of us actually has one of these.
oh, i know. look at him.
you guys want to get some coffee?
hi! hi ben!
oh, yeah go ahead.
no. no.
ben, its rachel! (he closes the door.) but whatever.
awww, just like his daddy.
what-what about monica?
(nervous) so it would just be, me alone?
huh umm…
well that—y’know it is just uh, I have never done that before. me and him alone.
okay. okay. okay. uh, what do i, what do i do with him?
okay.
yeah i think so.
bye. (ross exits.) ahhh… (silence) so this is fun, huh?
okay. uh, want something-want something to drink?
uh great! how do you feel about diet coke?
okay. well that is pretty much all that we have—oh! oh! have you ever had a virgin margarita? (holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)
water it is.
ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and i used to hang out all the time. ‘because i was, i was your daddy’s girlfriend.
no, I am not.
hey! we were not on a—okay. that is fine! fine. y’know what ben? one day when you are a lot older i am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
(checks her watch) fifty-two minutes. (pause) so no-no brothers and sisters, huh? that must be nice. you do not have to share stuff.
oh, you are one of those. but y’know what? i have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we would jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they would put salt on their cereal.
yeah? you like that one?
I am funny? oh thank god! well hey, I have got a ton of these! umm, oh hear—do you want a good one? here is a good one. umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. right? (does so.) and then you say to person, i bet you can not roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. and then when they do it, they are left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
yeah, i-i-i-I am funny ben, but I am not stupid. okay?
coming.
uh-oh.
oh yeah? did he pull the old… (she is waving her hand up and down her face. she is thinking about the pencil mark.)
oh that.
oh, come on! saran wrap on the toilet seat, you do not think that is just a little funny?!
(looking at his mark) yes.
hi!
well y’know i was just in the neighborhood and i passed by your building and i thought to myself, "what is up with carol and sweet, little ben?"
okay.
I would love that. i would loooove… (carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) so uh, so where is sweet little ben? i would love to have a little...
i found him! (to ben) very funny, come here! (she sits down on the coffee table and ben walks up.) that is exactly why I have come here to talk to you okay?
yes oh—(to ben)—do i want sugar in my coffee? (ben nods no.) no, just some milk would be good carol. thanks. (to ben) okay, do you remember all that stuff i taught you yesterday?
do not do that.
seriously, your dad does not like pranks.
oh damnit!
no! do not say that! do not say that!
no do not! go back to repeating!
oh crap!
so now what have we agreed?
and-and what else?
very good.
I am just visiting my good friend carol.
yeah!
carol…lesbian?
what line?
all right, I am sorry. I am sorry i did not tell you but you were so mad already!
okay, maybe they are not funny to you…
or carol! but they are funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
that was you?! we heard about you in junior high! did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "i will be revenged?!"
fine. fine, but I will have you know that once i taught him that stuff he called me fun aunt rachel. and i loved being fun aunt rachel but I will go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel if that is what you want!
look he does not have any brothers or sisters, somebody is going to have to teach him this stuff! and i have not taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old does not know anyway!
i got to go! (runs out.)
hey!
ohhh! well of course i will watch him! we have fun, do not we ben? (he nods yes.)
ohh, okay. (ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘poop.’) wh—ah-ha! (ross stops and turns.) wait a minute. uh ben, i can not do it.
i can not let him go out that way, he is got a meeting. (to ross) you have got something here on your back.
oh i…
no! wait! come on!
no you guys… (she walks out into the hallway.)
ehhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! my god!!!!!!!!!!! oh my god!!!!!!! (she runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
hi! hey, happy valentine’s day!
it is good. except he makes us watch the discovery channel all day long. did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the middle ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) oh, thank you. I will see you guys later.
(entering) hi.
i accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) who is this?
(talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it is hard to explain. just use your imagination!) oh, well, you are so cute! i wish i could play with you more, but I have got to go to work! i hope i stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes i do. yes i do. (still talking like that) bye-bye, joey. oh, i seriously can not stop it. (exits)
oh, I have got big valentine’s plans! I have got my chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
ooh! my chinese food! let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)
(entering) oh, hey, mona!
I will be watching tv if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
I am not here! that is just my chinese food!
you know what I am going to do? I am going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)
(entering) I am just going to grab the phone.
oh, I am sorry! do you need the phone?
(as ross enters with a present) but, but, mona, i live here.
(entering) hi! I am so sorry to barge in on your valentine’s, but i had to get away from all the yelling. mona is dumping ross.
why? you saw it? is it scary?
well, now, wait. now I am all freaked out. come on, you guys will watch it with me.
c’mon, seriously, you guys, you are not going to make me watch this alone!
okay. (watching the tape) ooh, my! (rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) woah! why is that baby torturing that woman?!
uh! it is horrible!
oh, my god!
what? did her ass explode?!
oh, screw you guys, you do not have to do it!
(thinking) you are going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. now, you are going to make yourself watch the whole thing. just do it! (rachel puts the tape in the vcr)
(thinking) hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
i did not know there were docks.
did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
monica's making jam.
mon?
(reading) 'gone for more jars. back later. monica geller.'
what?
what, what, what?
oooh.
honey, come on, i have to be at work in like ten minutes (ross starts kissing her neck) oh, all right, well it is not like I am employee of the year or anything. (they fall onto the couch)
oh, oh, that is what you are talking about. (to chandler) hey.
okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
nooo!
well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kind of catch on.
oh honey, I am sorry we can not help you there, because we are cuddlily sleepers. (chandler makes an 'ewww' face) okay, I am late for work.
all right are you guys going to come down?
good luck chandler.
bye hon.
(looks at him) you are so pretty.
well, what happened to your jam plan?
are you serious?
down at the docks again?
honey, I am sorry, but he is right. i love you, but you are crazy.
when did you go to a sperm bank?
phoebe, what are you doing?
pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for god knows how long, okay, you do not just give up something like that.
oh my god, what happened? (points to the cast on janice's wrist)
wow! spinning that sounds like fun.
(turns around, not amused) ross's what?
honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)
yeah.
hello.
we were not doing anything!
shhh.
no, come on, that is a lie. we also kissed in barbados.
yeah, you started it! I have got to chill.
we feel so terrible about this, ross.
ross? (to joey) can we just close the door?
ross, say something. anything.
no, no, no!
ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. you have every right to go nuts.
no, but you know what i mean.
calm ourselves?
well, what would we be doing?
feel me up?
hey.
oh, you bet.
okay, well, we brought you some wine.
well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
no awareness.
look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally does not drink like this.
ross, you do not even have oven mitts on!
ooy.
oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
ross, you do not seem okay.
oh, that is okay, girls tend not to like me.
you know what, ross? i think we are going to take off too.
no, no, it is just that it is getting late...
yeah, that is probably a good idea.
uh-huh. okay. you know what, joey, i do not think he is ever going to be okay with this.
(entering from her room) pheebs, i want to ask you something.
well since I am movin’ out and-and you are so beautiful…
…how about i move in with you?
you have a roommate?!
oh, that is true.
yeah, yeah i think I am going to find my own place.
pheebs, i have to ask you…
you are just staring into space.
this one? (picks it up.)
pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this; (points to one and starts to read it.) "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." it is just, there is nothing! the city’s full!
hey.
yeah! why?
that sounds great! I would love to live at warren’s!! i love warren! thank you!
oh, this is great! i am going to call him right now! (jumps up.) oh, thank you!
(returning from calling warren) ugh!!! well, the apartment is already subletted! i mean, this is just hopeless. I am never going to find anything.
what?!
oh my god! are you serious?!
i would love to live with you ross; that is-that is great! thank you!
ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me! i mean, i mean i was going to be homeless. you just saved me! you are my hero!
oh, i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has! (kisses him on the cheek and exits.)
hey!
oh thanks, but listen, i was just at monica’s and she and chandler had a big fight and they are not moving in.
no-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
yeah, i feel kind of bad for them, but I am also really psyched ‘because i do not have to move in here!
no-no, I am staying put.
why, where are you going?
hi!
oh wow.
yeah. y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but do not you think it is going to be weird?
well, because of us! because of our history.
no?
no! not at all!
okay, but ross, eventually you and i are going to be dating.
yeah! I am going to have a boyfriend, you are going to have a girlfriend…
but y’know what, if you think it is going to be okay we will just work out a system. y’know, it will be like college, I will hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "come back later, I am gettin’ lucky." (laughs.)
umm, well let us see monica and chandler are occupied.
no, the other thing. i really think it is great they work things out.
hey, can i borrow the key to your house so i can run across the street and make a copy?
thank you. (gets up) now are you sure? because once i make a copy, there is no turning back.
all right, well the place was closed. I will just copy it later.
well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. wait a minute, unless you are thinking about naked wednesday’s.
(entering) hi!
so what is the final head count on my baby shower?
what?! you mean they are not coming to a social event where there is no men and there is no booze?! that is shocking! i do not care, as long as my mom’s here.
what?! my mom’s not going to be here?!
my god!
so my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
please, make sure she comes. it is really important to me, i mean it is my mom!
i do not know.
okay. (mrs. green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
oh well actually going to use a nanny and uh, i do not even have a housekeeper.
mrs. kay! oh yeah, she was sweet. she taught me spanish. i actually think i remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (i think that is your mother’s crazy.)
well, however great she was i just can not afford that.
what?
wh-wh-what? what?
yes. yes i do.
why did you invite my mother?!
she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby.
eight weeks. i mean i love my mother, but my god, a long lunch with her is taxing.
what? you guys, come on! what am i going to do?
you are right. you are right. i mean I am about to have a baby, i can tell my mother that i do not want her to just be sleeping on my couch! oh my god! she is going to want to sleep in my bed with me. this cannot happen!
okay. (she goes over to tell her mother.)
mom that is okay that you did not get you a gift!
oh yeah. okay, see mom, the truth is i can do this on my own.
but mom, i really know what I am doing. i can handle this.
he was a hamster! i am not going to vacuum up my baby!
wow!
oh my gosh! oh wow! oh, i know what this is! (she is holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) wait a minute. that can not be right. is that a beer bong for a baby?
did i say i was done guessing? okay, thank you for that. oh wow! what is this?
oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
well that is gross, why do not you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
what?! it goes ten times a day! what are we feeding this baby?! indian food?!
i do not know, I would leave it on the changing table? (everyone gasps.) what?! what did i do? what did i do?!
oh come—(stutters)—of course i know that. i mean of course you never leave a baby alone! i mean who would—she would not be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. oh god, okay. y’know what? i think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. so i think umm, I am just going to maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. and for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
okay mommy, do not ever leave me. (hugs her.)
so umm, you are going to stay with me as long as i need you?
oh mom, i swear I am not an idiot. I have read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but i-i just did not think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. and-and then guess what? the baby’s coming and i do not know what to do. oh, can i throw up in my diaper genie?
wait-wait where are you going? where are you going?
okay.
oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
no. she is going to live with us for eight weeks.
yes! she is going to help us take care of the baby! woo-hoo. (sees that ross is not happy.)
i do. i really do. i do not know anything.
oh no? pheebs? monica? do i know anything about babies?
hello?! i still do not know what the hell I am doing!
i hope you are going somewhere with this.
really?
thank you. (hugs him.)
(closing a book) okay! I am ready.
yes, I have done my studying and i really know my stuff.
uh, put your elbow in it.
full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
check if it is wet, check if it is hungry, burp it!
a card! a card! i pick a card!
(starting to cry) ohh…
yeah, it is just y’know…
oh! i would love to read a poem.
(crying) it will be a short one.
ohhh…
wait, what do you mean you are getting a new brain?
she is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, i mean i do not think I have ever seen her finish a beverage.
oh!
cecilia monroe man, what a great actress.
(they both look behind them.) well, I would have to say gay.
well mainly because he is kissing that other guy.
oh yeah he is too cute to be straight.
all right, straight, and not subtle. (the man gets up and leaves.)
oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he will put it in lost and found.
what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love. i mean would not that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
what? wait! why…why do you get the story?
phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
okay. okay, see? i get the phone.
yeah! (breaking up) and until now, i did not think I would love again.
oh hey-hey wait! how do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
well umm, maybe we could uhh… (grabs the phone) ah-ha! too slow!!
no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; that is not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why do not we, why do not we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone.
i do not think so.
(checking the speed dial) all right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
yes okay. (checking the speed dial again.) well now see this is not telling us anything. (reading the speed dial) joe. carlos. peter. ooh! peter luger! t hat’s a steak house!
(looking at the speed dial) oh, i win! he is got barney’s on his speed dial.
(showing phoebe her phone) his new girlfriend!
hi pheebs!
how are ya?
umm pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that i was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?
and remember how i said i was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang i could just pick it up?
and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
you stole the phone!
no? so you are saying that if i called it, it would not ring?
umm, okay. but while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (rachel dials her phone and phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) oh, it does work! (rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of phoebe’s handbag.)
phoebe!
oh is it?! (she answers the cute guy’s phone.) uhh, hello? (on her phone) yes hi, is rachel there? (on the other phone) yes she is, just one moment please. (to phoebe, holding out both phones.) it is for me!
oh my god! i bet that is him. my digital fairy tale is about to begin. i wonder how i should be? should i be uh (in a sexy voice) hello? or should i be (happily) hi! it is rach… (phoebe knocks the phone out of rachel’s hand, catches it, and answers it.) would you stop doing that?!
phoebe! you can not do th…
you do know that i will be here when he comes over.
you just said it!
oh phoebe!
ohh! (exits.)
hey! hey!
well why should not i?!
well, then i get to give him the cell phone.
(laughs) you are not the man who left the cell phone.
is-is he coming? (looks hopefully out the door.)
we will be right back sir.
i do not know!
i know! (realizes what phoebe said.) what?!
(turning and looking at tom again) no-no they do but, you just have to wait.
(fake disappointment) all right. all right phoebe i will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
ohh…
hi.
oh my god! oh my god!! ohh, jessica lockhart!! in my apartment!! i am such a huge fan! i am such a huge fan!
(screaming) monica!!!! monica!!!! (runs to monica’s.)
god. you seem really, really nice.
i mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
okay.
you are so beautiful.
(giggles) (to ross) i can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
no!
hey, look, you guys, I am going for anything here, ok? i cannot be a waitress anymore, i mean it. I am sick of the lousy tips, I am sick of being called 'excuse me...'
uh... yeah, why?
(upset) oh my goood! oh, do you think it is on all of them?
hey... hi, ladies... uh, can i get you anything? (to monica, quietly): did you bring the mail?
(to monica): really? (out loud): sure, we have scones left! (to monica): ok, read them to me.
(out loud): we have apple cinnamon...

(grabs the bill) give me that!
hi! how are you?

well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
really.
but you could teach us.
oh, good for you!
oh wait, i have the ten of spades! here! (gives it to phoebe)
oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that is ok, i do not need them. I am going for fours.
ok, sorry to break up this party, but I have got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)
settle what?
oh. right.
(to ross): so basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
(opening mail) can you believe what a jerk ross was being?
oh, i beg to differ. the pictionary incident?
oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): oh! i got an interview! i got an interview!
(in disbelief): sak's... fifth... avenue.

no.
why?
oh my god!
hi!
guys! guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
noooo... the interview! she loved me! she absolutely loved me. we talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and—oh, i went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. i can do this. i can do this well!
oh god, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
no, no, that is ok. y'know, i think I am going to give it a go.
alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)
mmm-hmmm. oh, so typical. ooo, I am a man. ooo, i have a penis. ooo, i have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)
hmm. kind of stepped on my point there, mon.
ooooh, that is fine. we will see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
oh no-no-no-no-no, I am still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
your fly is open, geller. (he checks it, and zips up)
I am in.
well, well, well, hop back in bucko, because i got four sixes! (lays down cards) i won! i actually won! oh my god! y'know what? (collects chips) i think I am going to make a little ross pile. (holds up a chip) i think that one was ross's, and i think—oh—that one was ross's. yes! (starts singing): well, i have got your money, and you will never see it...
and your fly's still open...
ha, i made you look....
i could not be inner. monica?
uh, i will see you... and I will raise you. (throws chips in pot) what do you say... want to waste another buck?
I am not telling. (collects chips)
no..!
get your hands out of there! no!
(deals new hand) boy, you really can not stand to lose, can you? your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
oh, you are losing. definitely losing. (phone rings)
(answering phone) hel-lo, rachel green.
(on phone) excuse me. (covers up phone; to ross) it is about the job.
barbara! hi, how are you? (listens) uh-huh. (listens) no, i understand. yeah. oh, oh, come on, no, I am fine. do not be silly. yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea—hello? hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)
yeah...(sigh)....ok. where were we? oh, ok... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
yes, we do. (pause)
i see your fifty cents... and i raise you... five dollars. (throws it in)
well, i just lost a job, and I would like to raise the bet five bucks. does anybody have a problem with that?
(to ross): loser?
what do you mean, you fold? hey, come on! what is this? i thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I am not a nice guy.' i mean, what, were you just full of it?
how many you want?
dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) what do you bet?
ok... see your two... and i raise you twenty. (throws it in)
see your twenty-five...and...uh, monica, get my purse.
ok, then get me your purse.
(to monica): thank you. (to ross): i saw your twenty-five, and i raise you... seven.
(lays down cards) full house.
oh, time's up.
ok, ok, it is my turn. (reads the answer)
yes!
who is it?
hide my rings.
oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>
um... hi.
aw.
i have not seen you in like.. a year.
oh well yeah me too. um.. i had a baby.
oh.. yeah? well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.
mh hmm..
uh.... its emma.
oh amy, you remember ross.
amy! <pause> yes i do.. i really do. <grabs ross' hand for support>
yeah, no. ross has a phd.
god she is unbelievable.
oh sure ross, yeah. if i have a heart attack in a restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush.
what? what happened?
oh amy, do not cry amy.  um.. ross, could i talk to you in private?
um look i was thinking.. if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving.
look i know she is a little tough to take. she has no where else to go, and she is my sister. alright, she is emma's aunt. and i would like them to bond.
ross, you know what? she may need one..we are just going to have to make our peace with that!
hey you guys, this is my sister amy.  this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon.
oh we just put her down for a nap.
honey, i do not know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to ross or to myself <ross and rachel knock on wood> um you would not get the baby.
see look amy, we are a lot closer to monica and chandler. we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you do not seem very connected to the baby.
monica is ross' sister.
hey. amy. you have got to stop doing that.
well actually...
honey, you are taking this the wrong way. we think you are going to be a wonderful parent. it is just.. you are more the fun parent.
uchh! <much louder and longer then amy's>
yeah.. yeah right.. remember in high school when i died and did not give you my baby?
what? what carrer?
ok. you decorate dad's office and so now you are a decorator. okay! i went to the zoo yesterday and now I am a koala bear.
sup.. you want to talk supportive? you did not even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby.
i did the first time! oh. oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> and you know what. you want to know why I am not giving emily to you.
uh huh.
jealous of what? of your lack of responsiblity? you, your immaturity? your total disregard of other people's feelings?
timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
i cannot, i cannot believe that i invited you here today.
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> it is forty five.
you take that back.
take it back!
heey man, i work out.
i do pilates.
bring it on!
did you just push me?
alright. that is it! <pushes amy back>
ew! gross.
mon, I am so sorry.
are you okay mon?
look amy, it got a little of control..um.. and I am sorry. you are my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
uh. no.. i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount.
she needs changing.
hey! hey, pheebs, check it out. yeah, for my desert, i have chosen to make a traditional english truffle!
(worried) nothing?
so, if-if i mess this up, there is nothing else for dessert?
wow, monica, i love that, you really have faith in me. thank you. technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?
her dancer friends?
really?!
i dunno. y’know to me he will always be “jack geller, walks in while you are changing.”
(looking at her truffle) look at it, is not it beautiful?
it is a truffle. it is got all of these layers. first there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch, [joey and ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [joey and ross look like something is wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!
the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, y’know, i thought “well, there is mincemeat pie,” i mean that is an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [to joey] oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place?
(teasingly) and while I am gone do not you boys sneak a taste.
joey, god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
no!
yeah?
(sarcastically) no, i did, but tell me again, because it is so romantic.
joey! come on! i do not want to make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's going to be like “oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle?”
so why do not you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
okay...
what is up, ross?
yeah!
oh no. no ross, do not do this.
i just- i do not think us getting back together is a good idea.
i thought this might happen today. ross, i know the holidays can be rough. y’know? and it is probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
no, i-i live with phoebe. i mean you are [pity-tone] alone, alone. and i just-it is just not the time for us. I am sorry.
joey, you are going to have to stop rushing me, you know what? you do not get any dessert.
no, I am just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, it is trifle time!
it sure is.
beef.
alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste.
oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya got to take a bite with all the layers!
op! wait, you dropped a pea.
well?
really? how good?
okay, now what was that all about? is it-does it not taste good? let me try it.
...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
oh, phoebe, do i want to hear this?
(humoring phoebe) oh my god, he dream-cheated on you!
(reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) i was not supposed to put beef in the trifle!
you guys! it was bananas, cream, and beef! i-i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i would not feel bad!
hi!
hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
i, uh, think you already are.
yeah, yeah i like him a lot.
yeah, otherwise I am not going.
this is such a great party! 35 years. very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
hmmm….
thank you…we are so excited
yeah, if you are going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
no, i know i do not either, but ya know what, it is their party, and it is just one night. and we do not even have to lie; we just will not say anything. if it comes up again, we will just…smile. we will nod along.
oh…
(looking at the check) unbelievable!
open it! open it! open it!
but it was beautiful. i mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
on a cliff, in barbados, at sunset, and stevie wonder sang is not she lovely as i walked down the aisle.
yeah, stevie’s an old family friend. (hits ross’s chest)
so would i. you would not think that annie liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
what? I am not you. this may be the only wedding i ever have. i want it to be amazing.
okay, ross, it has to be realistic.
and my veil was lace, made by blind, belgium nuns.
well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
well, i do not know about that, but some said that i looked like a floating angel.
oh yeah. that is a great story.
shhh! i want to hear the rest!
and the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
ross, it just would not have been feasible.
it was really fun being married to you tonight.
okay ross, can i uh, can i ask you something?
that proposal, at the planetarium…
are you kidding?! with the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! it was…really wonderful! did you just make that up?
well, that would have been very hard to say no too.
goodnight
i will think about it.
(entering, happily) gooood morning!!
well, why should not i be? i have great friends! i have a wonderful job!
come on, it is not a big deal! we stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
(pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) we… we are not… …going to let it… be a problem.
well y’know, we did other stuff too. (joey and chandler start to giggle.)
oh monica come on, y’know i do not sleep with guys on the first date!
anymore!!
hi. tag, i have a conference call today is that correct?
okay, thank you. that will be all. (the mail guy leaves and tag starts to follow, but rachel stops him.) (excitedly) wait! wait! (rushes over and closes the office-door.) did you see that? that mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (they kiss.)
okay, you hard worker! I will remember to put that in your evaluation.
well, you have been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. but y’know, there is one thing that i have yet to evaluate. (she turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
no, I have just always wanted to do that. can you help me clean this up?
(hugging him) so did you read your evaluation yet?
(worried) okay please, you are kidding right?! i wrote that one as a joke for you!
I am thinkin’ no.
umm, i said i thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that i like your tiney-tiny touchie.
well, it gets worse. when asked if you take initiative i wrote, "yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under problems with performance i wrote, "dear god, i hope not," and then uh, then i drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
maybe it is not as bad as i think. y’know, maybe they did not take it the way i meant it.
ugh, i just got to get the thing back!
yeah?
oh my god! joey!
ugh!
okay, i think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we are going to have to get into mr. zelner’s office. now, he does not get in until 10, so he is no problem, but his assistant, betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
yeah, well betty’s kind of sad. which is why i believe i can lure her away with these chocolates. (holding up the box of chocolates.) now, while i distract her, you get in the office.
let us roll!
(worried and shocked) yeah, sure mr. zelner, for you anything—minute. okay. fine. (to tag) abort the plan, abort the plan. (she start to usher tag out.)
okay. uh, well can we, can we get you anything mr. zelner? maybe some chocolates? (holds up the box.)
(laughs) oh my god. can you imagine if there was?! i mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.
well…
oh no-no-no…
you are lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) it does not matter.
whoa! i can not believe you did that. that was really sweet.
no, you could have lost your job.
thank you! you are great! (they kiss.)
what?
i… it just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
(looking at his butt) there it is. (they hug.)
hi! oh, how was your date last night?
oh good. (she walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) ahhh! my god, sorry! (she closes the door and confronts joey.)
what-what?! you are going to leave this person with me?!
why?! what?! are you kidding?!
y’know what? that is a lot to remember, can not i just tell her you are a pig?
well forget it, I am not telling that girl anything. that is not my responsibility.
hi.
yeah, joey kind of disabled it when i moved in.
hi.
(pause) would you like some pancakes?
yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
i know!
oh and I will call ya too!
bye!
oh joey, I am sorry i just could not tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. and y’know we got to talking and i…
cupid.
look joey, come on she is so perfect for you! i mean she is sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
fine. (they start to walk away.)
phoebe!
I am sorry?
oh my god! did you get to see anything good?
yeah, there was. it was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—yes, there was.
well now what is the rush?
well look who is here!
hi! well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. oh no!
oh phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
(does a retching sound) wait a minute! why do not you guys do something?!
how did it go with erin?
(gasps) oh my god! listen to you talkin’ about having kids. oh my joey. (she goes over and hugs him.) oh, please do not get married before i do.
so how is it going with joey?
okay? wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? i mean tell me that you like him.
but you said that you liked him! i mean what happened?! did ya just change your mind?!
ugh, tramp!
yeah, see ya.
wow. well, i guess it was cupid who brought her here.
hi!
jo-joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? umm, i kind of got the feeling from her today that uh, she is not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
well, she told me. she said she is kind of a loner.
joey…
yeah and honey i promise next time that i will just say good-bye and tell ‘them you are not looking for a relationship.
well that too. (joey goes into his room.) joey?
do you want some pancakes?
(comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) hi.
oh, y’know I am not that much of a sweet tooth. i—(chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—wow. my god, so creamy. oh my god, this is the best cheesecake i have ever had. where did you get this? (she reaches over to look at the label on the box.)
chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs. (gasping) thief.
why, why not?
chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong.
(taking a bite) oh, I am sorry what?
umm, i think he is still out. what is wrong?
(reading the note) "pheebs, can not make it, got a date. talk to you later. big daddy." (laughs) big daddy?
hi!
so just bring it back downstairs, what is the problem?
are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (pause) wow! my whole mouth just filled with saliva!
yeah and we will drop it off downstairs so that we are not tempted.
momma’s little bakery, chicago, illinois. (they exit with the cheesecake.)
what? wait a minute, i did not pay, i thought you paid!
(gasps) its still there! (the cheesecake they returned to mrs. braverman is still lying in front of her door.)
she could be out of town. maybe she will be gone for months.
no that could kill her.
no so we are protecting her.
but we should move quick.
because i think i just heard her moving around in there.
(taking a bite) oh my god! that is so good!
hey!
oh it is umm, it is tofu cake. do you want some? (he makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, chandler follows him in.)
(with a mouthful) mm-mmm. (nods no.)
oh, what are you going to do?! are you going to go run tell monica?! are you going to tell joey?! no! because then you will have to tell them what we did! we are desert stealers! we are living outside the law!
what?! what?!
wait a minute!
oh no-no-no-no-no, no you do not!
you think i trust you with it?! no! we are going to split it! you take half and i take half!
what? oh, well then y’know what? i think monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
okay! (grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) all right, pick a half.
oh for god sake just pick a piece!
that is also the smaller piece. (puts the piece onto a plate.) okay, there you go. enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. no sharing. no switching, and do not come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (as she is saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) oh!!!!
okay, you got to give me some of your piece.
oh! yay! look! there is a piece that does not have floor on it!
hey, come on now!
(running from the guy's apartment with joey in tow) hey, what is-what is going on?!
awww, no, it is okay, we have actually known for a while.
well, ross, we were worried about you. we did not know how you were going to react.
oh! oh, i just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
okay.
she is so cute! you could fit her right in your little pocket!
aww, joey, come here. (she takes his hand.) look honey, i know this must be really, really difficult for you and i--oh, I am sorry. am i hurting you?
hmm. look, ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why do not you just pay the hundred bucks? the party's going to cost you way more than that.
okay, i thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head.
well, because she loves you and because you love her.
hey, chandler, do not freak out! I am telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he did not want to have babies. and she is a woman, and she is almost 30, and y'know it is monica.
no, you are right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different.
not unless different means the same.
hi! wow! you look, you look…big.
uhhh, yeah. but it is not obvious why.
hey! hey, cute jacket!
oh! ow! (joey motions, "you see what i mean?!")
whoa! (laughs) y'know what katie? i got to tell ya i-i-i-i think you are the one who is too much. (she punches katie back.)
ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (she retaliates.)
ohh, you are so sweet! (she kicks katie in the shin.)
ohhhh, i cannot look at it! (she does not move.)
oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but I am not sure, chandler?
(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) okay. hey. umm. does everybody hate these shoes?
(to ross) tell him.
(running into the living room) thank you, thank you, thank you, pheebs.
no, no, no, no turtles scare me. i do not need that today.
oh honey, thank you, but mark's taking me out.
yeah, it is kind of like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to phoebe) is this actually a lunchbox?
oh.
yeah. what kind of discount do we get?
oh!! i love this job! (her phone rings) wow! my first call.
hi honey!
oh, he is just goofing around.
oh honey, this is his office too. i told you we are joanna's two assistants.
oh! oh my god! what did i just do?
i think i just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. oh honey, i got to go. (to mark) mark, i need you!
ow! ross!!
oh, yeah, sure, it is umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from love story)
oh no, no-no-no, that is not, not, not, what he is doing. he is just, he is just really romantic.
yes.
all right ross!! i get it!!
you are hurt!
oh, please, ross it was so obvious! it was like you were marking your territory. i mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
look, i know what is going on here, okay, mark explained it all to me. he said this is what you guys do.
ohhh! that is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)
(now standing behind ross) ross!
so ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
right.
hello.
a big idiot.
honey, why is it hard, i mean we have been together for almost a year now?
honey, that is very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there is no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)
where ya going?
ohh, with who?
there was a woman at the... (realizes) the stripper?!
you have a play date with a stripper?!
sure, is she married?
oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)
noo, i y'know i do not see why she has to play with you, that is all. i mean does not she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
I am not jealous. all right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. and y'know, and um, i...
ugh. wait, wait, wait.
(to chandler) well, there is a kiss that he will not forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
oh, phoebe, are you still on hold? i was supposed to call my dad back like two hours ago.
what is flimby’s?
okay. hang up! that is it! come on!
no. no, not at all, not at all. i actually was going to bring someone myself, so…
i meant, me plus one!
okay, bye-bye!
okay, i need a date! (runs to her bedroom)
oh, hi!
how are you? (she goes to kiss him on the cheek, but stops because of the dates and pats him on the shoulder.)
hey.
yeah, looks that way. first ones here! wooo!!
oh! tommy, this is ross. ross, tommy.
okay, uhh, i think I am going to run to the ladies room.
oh, hi!
hey. gosh, you look soo familiar.
we are not actors.
hey!
what time is it?
tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we are going to lunch.
you do not?!
umm, or, maybe, i should stay away from all men.
(not seeing ross) what is your favourite thing about summertime?
yeah…
tommyyyy! say, what is your favourite thing about summer?
ross, would you just stop it! it is getting really old.
phoe-be!!
hi! i just want to-(sees monica)-ahhh!!! oh my god! (she runs out in horror.) oh my god!
since when do take naps in that position. oh god monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
(gasps) that cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening ray liotta?
y'know what, just give me a second and I will be out of your hair. I am just going to grab a jacket. when i get back, i want every little detail. (there is a knock on the door.) maybe that is him. (goes to answer the door.)
why are not you guys at the movie?
so chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend?
so mon, when are we going to meet this new secret waiter man?
i do not care! i want to meet this guy who is the best sex she ever had!
what-what-what are you going to do?
maybe joey's right. maybe all good deeds are selfish.
chandler! (pause) is he?
(entering) hi! are you ready? we are going to be late!
for stella! remember? she is gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
sure. i guess. hey, i hear you do not have to go to london. yay!
like what?
well, why do not you talk to me about it, maybe i can help.
well, i-i know you can do that too. I am just, I am just saying if you need somebody to talk to… hi!
ross? look, whatever this relationship stuff that emily wants, just give it to her. come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. so just fix whatever she wants fixed. just do it. (the phone starts ringing.) i mean, you are going to have to try. you will just going to hate yourself if you do not. (the phone keeps ringing.) oh come on answer it! it is driving me crazy!
yeah, i mean, you should play in public!
oh, i can not believe i ever let him touch me with those fingers.
why not?
phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
yeah, phoebe you are… awful!
i know, i remember that!
well, chandler, you are going to have to tell him.
because you do.
phoebe, his music could not get any worse. there are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
what?
hey! out of all of us, who do you think is going to get married next?
(to the gang) oh my god, melissa warburton. i do not think i have the energy for this.
(screaming) melissa!
wh—(turns and looks at the gang who is staring)—why do not i tell you over here? (she walks melissa away from the gang.)
oh no-no, no! it is good! it is all good! i-i actually work at ralph lauren!
i will not! I am the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
oh please…
no.
oh tomorrow, oh i do not know. um…
shut up.
oh, wow thanks! (reading the card) oh you are in real estate!
wow! what do you do now?
okay! (joins the rest of the gang.)
shut up that was my friend melissa from college.
she is actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
(to monica) yes.
it is not a big deal!
no we were not! it was nothing! it was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.
oh wow. why do not we just take me (grabs her pin) and put me with a manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (puts her pin at the bar and laughs. monica just glares at her.) these pins are not for playing are they?
hey!
stop picturing it!!
that is not a problem.
oh, get out of here! (jumps back and walks away.)
(motioning to a rack) so now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there is anything that you like, we can make you a deal. anything at all. (grabs a few) but these are the three that monica pre-approved.
I am monica’s maid of honor. okay? do not try to blue pin me!
oh they are nice. we-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they are done with them they just send ‘them back.
some of them.
honey, might i suggest watching a little more espn and a little less e!?
umm, well let us see uh, this one is tom brokaw.
(reading a tag) this one is uh paul of’neil.
he plays for the yankees. seriously, espn! just once and a while, have it on in the background. (chandler nods and rachel grabs another tux) ooh, this one was pierce brosnan!
uh-huh.
yeah.
yeah.
it is a pretty cool tux.
(entering) hey!
so joey i just hooked ross and chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
well, what are you going to wear?
huh. does monica know about this?
can i please be there when you tell her? (joey nods yes.)
oh, y’know what? i can not. i have to have dinner with that melissa girl.
well, do you want to hear what actually happened or joey’s lewd version?
hey, come on! i had this friend from college and i made the stupid mistake of telling joey that one time…she and i y’know…kissed a little bit.
it-it did!
yeah, it was senior year in college. it was after the sigma chi luau and melissa and i got very drunk! and we ended up kissing! for several minutes!
yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
I am not saying that I am a lesbian! I am just saying that this happened!
(shocked) vanilla?!
I am not vanilla! I have done lots of crazy things! i mean i got-i got drunk and married in vegas!
all right, y’know what? if you do not want to believe me about this, why do not you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
oh. oh, that is great!
(changing the subject) anyway, speaking of drinking too much. i was uh, tellin’ phoebe about that one crazy night after the sigma chi luau where you and i uh, we made out.
remember?! we—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
…we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
how can you not remember us kissing?!
wh… come on! remember? we were on the sleeping porch! we could not stop giggling? and our coconuts kept knockin’ together?
yeah—but come on—listen, I am sorry i do not want to make you uncomfortable, but i told phoebe that it happened and she does not believe me.
no!!
thank you phoebe.
it happened! i am telling you it happened!
what?! wait a minute! no wait a minute! (she does so.) okay? look, that night was the one wild thing i have ever done in my entire life, and I am not going to let you take that away from me! okay, so if you do not remember that, maybe you will remember this! (she grabs melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
(shocked) what?
(moving away) whoa! whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! whoa! whoa!
(moves away again) i-i-i-I am just…I am just a good kisser!
I am sorry!
wow! i mean i had no idea that that was going to…
what the hell was that?!
and?
well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. (chandler enters.) aww, look at you all handsome!
oh does it matter?! all that matters is that you look so handsome.
i do not want to say.
diane keeton.
monica what?
what is the emergency?!
well, i like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
okay. okay. okay. umm, maybe you can start with, "chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew i wanted more."
well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (she realises what that could have meant.)
hey!
hey, what have you guys been up to?
i can not believe they have been together for three years.
i do not know why they did not just tell us.
arghh!! (she quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
what?!
oh my god!
oh my god!!!
phoebe!! phoebe!! it is okay!! it is okay!!
i know!! i know!! i know!
yes, i know! and joey knows! but ross does not know so you have to stop screaming!!
(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) hi!! hi!
nothing! oh god, we are just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
all right honey, we would better go if we want to catch that movie.
are you kidding?!
i can not believe he would do that to mon—whoa! (she stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at joey. joey is avoiding her eyes.) joey, do they know that we know?
joey!
ugh, i knew it! oh i cannot believe those two!
joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner phoebe breaks chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
okay!
you really think it would be that different?
well, things change.
hey, who is this little naked guy?
aww, look at the little thing.
wow, monica, you look just like your grandmother. how old was she there?
well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.
oh, can we read them?
okay.
(to monica) monica, will-will you marry me?
wait a minute! (to monica) you let ross drive the porsche and when i ask you, you say you are the only one who is allowed to drive it.
(shocked) you let joey drive it?!
wow! i can not believe you lied to me.
take the top down did ya?
come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what she is talking about! i am an excellent driver!
well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.
i think she is checking out your beehive ross.
give me the keys!
well no brush!
(to the woman) alimony. (runs outside.)
ahhh! (gets in.) ooh, nice!
my god!
just washing the windshield. (she turns on the wipers forcing ross off of the hood.)
oh.
look ross, if you are so freaked out, just get in the car!
all right. (she starts off.)
what are you doing?! get in the front!
oh my…
god. i forgot how much i love driving. i have got to get my license renewed.
oh ross you are so tense! you just got to relax okay? just need to relax all right? just need to relax… (she takes her hands off of the wheel.)
i am not horsing around okay? i am porsching around.
uh-oh. (she starts to pull over.)
really? you think so?
okay. switch places with me! switch places with me! come on! I will go under, you go over!
oh come on ross!! (she tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)
(sexily) hi officer, was i going a little too fast?
oh yes, absolutely! y’know, it is weird uh, but i had a dream last night where i was stopped by a policeman. and then he uh…well i probably should not tell you the rest.
(handing it to him) yes. here you go officer uh, handsome.
oops sorry, my mistake.
really?! you think so? y’know, i had just rolled out of bed.
y’know you are-you are probably wondering about the old date on there.
yeah.
i bet you are a gemini.
taurus?
virgo?
sagittarius?
i knew it! i knew it, ahh….
yeah?
i will not speed.
i promise.
yeah!
oh well…

fourth gear!!
well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two of the clock position.
it is a different guy!
oh my god!
(pause) you have a son!
oh, she is coming up! she is coming up! (turns on the tv)
no way, forget it.
chandler, i got to tell you, i love your mom's books! i love her books! i cannot get on a plane without one! i mean, this is so cool!
oh, hi sweetie. (they kiss)
hi! sorry- sorry we are late, we, uh, kind of just, y'know, lost track of time.
mrs. bing, i have to tell you, I have read everything you have ever written. no, i mean it! i mean, when i read euphoria at midnight, all i wanted to do was become a writer.
hey.
what are you guys doing out here?
well,sounds like you two have issues.
goodbye, baby.
hey.
yeah. thought I would give it a shot. I am still on the first chapter. now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
hey.
okay. (writes a little more) i am so hot!
(into microphone) central perk is proud to present miss phoebe buffay.
(into mike) okay, that was phoebe buffay, everybody. woo!
okay. now this is just the first chapter, and i want your absolute honest opinion. oh, oh, and on page two, he is not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
alright, alright, so I am not a great typist...
alright, that is it! give it back! that is it!
come on joey!!!
i can not believe you would say that!
no! i mean come on! this is a huge deal! (she sits next to him on the couch.) fine i want—i need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
is he romantic with her?
are they in love?
you do not know anything.
what?
pheebs, i do not think anyone's mad about that.
oh umm, y'know i lent it to joey and i never actually got it back.
(to monica) hey!
what is up?!
well yeah, i do, but i decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend monica. y'know i-i feel that we do not talk anymore. how are you? what is new with you?
oh y'know what, we do not have to talk about work. we can talk about anything!
hey! y'know what? let us talk about relationships!
nothing! you go!
wow that is uh, juicy. umm, (checks watch) y'know what though mon, i actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there is just not anything else?
no! (gets up to leave.) (under her breath.) if there was i would not tell you.
ross could not fit down the trash chute.
there he is!
ohh, out, oh god, i do not know why we did not think to check there!
you walked around all night in the city by yourself?
yeah! no that is what i was thinking.
ross! janice?!
(entering) okay, i have to tell you something that i have never admitted during our entire friendship! but, when we were in high school i made out with james farrell even when i knew that you liked him! wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! okay, you go!
ugh, monica, i know about you and chandler.
i overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I will just tell rachel that I am doing laundry for a couple of hours." and he said, "laundry? is that my new nickname?" and you said, "no! you know what your nickname is, mr. big."
well, i would not know because i got so freaked out that i hung up the phone.
what?!
all right. so you are telling me that there is nothing going on between you and chandler.
sure! why?
what?! she just called and said that she was going to be working late! she keeps lying to me! that is it! y'know what? I am just going to go over there and confront them right now!
hey! hi!
well, i was actually—i-i came over here to-to borrow this lamp. to umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
yeah!
oh! what a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
that is good enough. right? (pause.) okay, well umm, I am going to go look at my books!
okay.
'kay. (pause.) congratulations on your new job. (she goes and hugs monica and is almost in tears.)
well do not—what happened to jessica’s body?!
you do not know do you?
oh! (motions to joey’s co-star.)
hi.
well, joey probably thinks I will just embarrass him. y’know, he thinks I am some kind of a soap opera nut—which I am not! I am not. although i do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (starts stroking his arm) and uh, and that your-your dog’s name is wally. well look at that, I am just stroking your arm.
oh, we are leaving. bye kash.
say hi to wally.
hi!
i thought i was a complete idiot.
oh! oh, i think I am going to throw up a little bit. what did you say?
what?!
okay joey, first of all kash ford is not people. second of all, what did he say when you told him i was pregnant?
good-good, do not tell him. do not tell him. just have him call me okay?
okay, you go do it! I will come back to that set! I will meet more actors! I will meet ‘them all!
hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I am not drinking on this date tonight. "umm, I am a recovering alcoholic. I am a mormon," or "i got so hammered last night I am still a little drunk?"
hi!
oh no, i can not. i got a date.
yeah. why? is that weird for you?
yeah—ooh! earrings! (goes into her room.)
(entering from her room) hey guys do you think this is too slutty—hi kash!
yeah! all right, I will see you guys later.
thank you.
hi!
well I am alone and i just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
i made the mistake of telling him that i was pregnant.
well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.
he got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "yeah, i hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
does not he?
yes.
okay.
(thinks then gasps) chandler m. bing?
oh my god. (laughs)
oh it is all right. I am guess I am just done with the whole dating thing. it is one more thing in my life that is suddenly completely different. this is hard.
thanks sweetie.
oh no, i think I am going to go home and eat ten candy bars.
oh you did, there are twenty in here.
good night.
joey.
(seeing the ring) oh my god. (pause) okay.
so uh…i guess we should…make it official huh?
hey you.
uh yeah, actually i kind of need to talk to you too.
i know, i still need to talk to you.
hi.
uhh… i think i just got engaged.
well…did you know he was going to ask me?
and you really think this is a good idea?
i just do not know! it just does not feel right.
really?! even ross?
i guess so.
i can not say that I am surprised.
of course! oh joey, this ring i…it is beautiful i love it!
hey!
yeah! hi emma. hey, why do you think she will not take my breast?
okay sweetie, you can do it. just open up and put it in your mouth.
I am sorry honey, what were you saying?
oh look, she is pulling away again! do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (joey gets embarrassed.) she looks scared. does not she look scared?
it is just so frustrating! why does not she want my breast?!
hey. i need to tell you something.
joey asked me marry him.
joey proposed to me.
well, i-i said yes.
i know. days of our lives, thank you very much.
why not? i do not want to do this alone! and he is such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
sure.
yeah, i mean whatever.
no. no, i do not. could you be a dear and go tell him?
hey.
surprised?
i know.
you did not propose to me. joey did.
uh… you did not propose to me, chandler did not propose to me, but joey did.
yes you did!
well then why did you give me a ring?
yes, you did!
yes, you did!
yes, you did! and do not you say, "no, i did not!"
he was right there. he got down on one knee and proposed.
yeah, what did happen?
yeah, but you said, "will you marry me?"
yes, you did!
yes, you did—oh my god you did not! (screams) well then why did not you tell me that before?!
well then joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
you were going to propose to me?
okay.
oh my god!
she is doing it look, she is breast-feeding look!
okay.
oh wow, this feels weird.
wonderful weird.
honey do not worry, it was my mistake.
she is perfect.
we really are.
i know. i know. I have feeling…
yeah. (laughs nervously)
yeah, maybe.
wh-what is that?
I am sorry, what?
no.
shut up!
all right, all right, all right. last night, i had a dream that, uh, you and i, were...
well, you were pretty damn good.
well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
get off.
what are you playing with?
off to see young ethan?
just a touch. mon, i do not understand. i mean, you have been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? i mean, why all the sudden are you so... oh.
could tonight be the night?
so, did you shave your legs?
a-ha!
no, forget it.
all right, fine. um, you were not the only one there. (camera fades to ross, who is listening very carefully) joey was there too.
no.
no, it was just the three of us.
(laughs) you know what?
there were times when it was not even me.
mon, ethan called again. mon?
ethan called again.
i, i did not say any... i sw... i did not say anything, i swear. he stopped by.
where are you going?
(understands that monica and ethan want to be alone) hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
true story.
let us dry  them again.
(talking in her sleep) oooooooooh. (rachel strokes her hand over the pillow. ross mimicks her silently) oh, that is nice. oh, oh. huh, ross!
ross?
you are. well, um... we, we, we were just...  wow!
what?
what?
i do not know where the phone is.
ross?
what, so i can not lokk nice? there might be doctors there.
rossy, rossy.
ok! can not believe I am risking this again, but you are on! all right joe, you remember the rules! heads i win, tails you lose.
oh, that sounds good!
it is all done!
i know... honey, seriously, i did it all. the luggage that I am taking is in the bedroom, this is emma's paris stuff, these are the boxes that I am having shipped, and that is the sandwich that i made for the plane...
oh, well. everything that i need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that i will be needing them.
it should be right next to my plane ticket.
what? maybe i put it in here (she opens her bag). oh, oh, it is not in there! oh, no! i must have packed it in one of these boxes!
shoot. oh, i can not believe i did this!
no, no, no. it is ok. I am going to be fine.
well, I have been better.
you guys are going to come and visit me, right?
I am going to miss you so much.
you know what? uhm, i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you and i was going to save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).
oh, pheebs, i do not even know where to start.
oh, oh. (she is holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). what is this?
I am going to throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
i love you phoebe.
all right. well, if i going to do this, I would better keep going.
ok. monica?
can you come here with me for a minute?
mon... okay... I have got to... just say what it is I am going to say... none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it was not for you. no-one has been more like a sister to me...
(starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she is saying) i would not know what I am going to do without you...
(says something that cannot be understood)
i... i... i... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
(laughs) oh, I am sure going to miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i do not get.
well, these are not mine. maybe monica used to use them with...
well, i think you are forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
(to chandler) can i talk to you alone for a minute?
oh honey...
(all mushy) oh, you know what? let us not say anything else. i love you. (they hug)
okay. oh...
oh!
oh... (holding ross's shoulder) well...
i think I am going to take off. (pats ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)
oh, you guys. this was an amazing night. thank you so much. i love you. good night.
what?
ross...
you really think i did not say goodbye to you because i do not care?
i cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know one thing about me.
because it is too damn hard ross. i can not even begin to explain to you how much I am going to miss you. when i think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... okay, so if you think that i did not say goodbye to you because you do not mean as much to me as everybody else, you are wrong. it is because you mean more to me. so there, all right, there is your goodbye... oh!
what?
what?
ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
yeah. and y’know who should have shut their drapes? is that perverted old couple two doors over.
oh do not even ask!
oh ross, hi! hey, how are ya? there you are!
(to gunther) I will take a coffee. (to ross) so how was your big date last night?
yeah fun? great! so uh, so did you guys hit it off?
so uh, so did anything happen? because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
oh, slides. (laughs.) so really nothing happened.
right. was it the, "please do not show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
she asked-asked you out again?
okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! i got it! i got it! i got it! i can not! i can not! i can not! i cannot go with you and my sister thing. okay? i just can not. it is just too weird, all right? i imagine the two of you together and i freak out. it freaks me out. i can not do it! i can not do it.
thank you. i…yeah.
no-no-no! no-no-no! please ross, i can not! i can not do it! (starts to freak out.) it is just going to freak me out!!!
ross thanks.
oh no! no! no-no-no-no! no, i mean come on that is-that is crazy—i mean that is crazy. so what is-what is going on with you? what is going on with you?
yeah do it now, call right now.
hey!
ohhh well. y’know what honey? the best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. oh! there is this great guy you will love at work named bob! he is a real up-and-comer in human resources.
it is not random, it is bob.
no honey, okay, okay, you want to know why ross canceled the date? because i asked him to.
hm-mmm.
because you are my sister and ross and i have this huge history…
no.
(changing the subject) y’know bob in human resources…
look, this is not that big of a deal! you just do not date ross! there is a million other guys out there, you just…
I am not telling you what to do! i am telling you what not to do!
jill this is not about me being jealous of you! this is about you being a brat! wanting what you can not have!
all right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating bob!
in human resources!!!!!!
…i am jealous of her?! i mean who does she think she is?! princess caroline?!
do i have my own castle?
no.
oh my god!
wow! i mean, i just—i can not, i can not believe this. y’know, i mean you think you know someone even, even phoebe who is always been somewhat of a question mark.
absolutely not.
probably just the first half.
well it is hard to tell… (rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she is having some trouble.) oh god, if she would just stop moving.
oh, it is a tattoo! that is weird, phoebe does not… wait that is ursula! that is not phoebe that is ursula!
hey! have you guys seen jill? i can not find her anywhere.
well, is ross home? maybe I will just call him to see if he is actually seen her.
(on phone) what is my sister doing there?! and why are the drapes shut?!
ross! i think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
ross, i am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
oh! i knew it! what happened?
what?! you kissed!
well, it does not sound like it! i mean, it is pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just do not kiss them! see look at us, right now, not kissing!
yeah that is right you were not thinking! y’know what? let me give you something to think about! (she pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
what?!
wow. i, i do not even know what to say. thank you. (gently kicks him.)
yeah, i got that.
bye-bye-e!
well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I am going to whip them with a car antenna!
that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
I am just going to go in my office and pick up some stuff . (to the guy behind her desk) who the hell are you!?
I am the hell person whose office this is!
excuse me?
wait a minute! what do you mean, you are taking over my job?
a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
alright! do not get too comfortable there, because I am back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was. i can not say that i care too much for the way you have rearranged my office.
excuse me?
can you please, please take care of it for me?
let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
that is right. you are very cheeky for a temp.
oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department?
did they mention that I am rubber and you are glue?
oh, hi mr. zelner.
that is great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to?
(to herself) oh, wow. super ass-kissing power.
today.
no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i did not come back today, they were going to fire me.
alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they did not actually say that. I am just afraid if i do not come back right now this guy's going to try to squeeze me out.
i know. you know, we are just going to have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today?
come on, i do not know what else to do.
ross?
you are pretty.
alright. now that I am back, why do not you just fill me in on what you have been up to?
hey, they were popular when i left!
well, i should be involved in that, so why do not you get me up to speed?
oh, no no no no. i see what you are doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. okay, I have had it for five years, and i know how it works, so why do not you just catch me up!
(sits down in her chair) oh god. you have totally messed with the back support of my chair. how do you fix this?
fine, i will. (pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it "collapse") alright, fill me in!
yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think I am caught up on everything. so ask me anything!
except that! (mr. zelner enters) oh, hello, mr. zelner. we are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
what? i can not do that! i have the baby, and ross is not going to pick her up for another hour.
well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you will knock  them dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!
no, i can not, i have a baby.
why would you do that?
that is really nice.
then you are not going to like what is coming. (starts crying) I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. thank you, thank you.
(entering from bathroom) hey-hey! oh, look at you, all sexy.
ooooh! wow!! oh, hi.
how come you did not come over earlier?
yeah, i just have to get dressed.
yeah! once, i figure out what I am wearing.
(entering from her bedroom) you guys, (holds up an outfit) does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
uh, no. wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. nevermind.
(entering from her bedroom) what?!
(entering from her room) is this a little too... (sees phoebe) pheebs, what happened?
ooooh! honey, well we will find you something. do you want to wear my black jacket?
no, you are right. well, we will find something. let us just get you out of that. come on.
monica, can phoebe borrow your green dress?
pheebs, you go with monica and try on her green dress. if that does not work, you can wear my gray silk one. oh, gosh, what am i wearing?!
well, hon-ey. I am just trying to look nice for your big night.
ross, that was a halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as little bo peep.
yeah, which, by the way chandler, i would like back one of these days.
oh, it is perfect! but not for tonight.
no honey, we are sorry, we did not mean it. i love you. i love you.
(entering from her room) okay, pheebs, quick, what shoes should i wear? the black or the purple?
yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. maybe i should wear pants?
but i...
all right.
I am not going to gooo.
no, i think I am going to catch up on my correspondence.
I am not going to gooo, so i think that will accomplish the not going.
well, ever since i was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I am just, i do not know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
it is fine.
I am not mad.
I am just not going.
right.
um, hum.
no.
right.
right, and the humiliating.
um, hum.
right.
yes, ross. (turns toward him)
no, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. that actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
i think you should drink the fat.
no, no, no, wait! okay, okay. do not! I will go, I will go!
you were really going to do that, were not you?
you were going to drink the fat.
and i still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) okay, that was about seven seconds.
come on. (they start to leave) oh! and, uh, by the way....
I am going commando, too.
okay you have to realize, i was exhausted, i was emotional, i would have said yes to anybody. like that time you and i got married! (pause) I am not helping.
that is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but i am prepared to let that go.
well—really? i thought chandler was your best friend.
ooooo!
(enters with emma) hi!
oh you guys thanks for doing this.
oh ah! (sees a big stuffed gorilla) oh my gosh there is something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! what are people think… (reads the card) oh you guys i love it.
he is downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
well, you more then me, but he can not stay to mad at me. i mean, i just had his baby.
yeah, I am not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
oh great, the pacifiers?
the burping clogs?
the diapers?
alright thanks, oh ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
umm let me think...what do i want, what d-of i w-a-n-t...
blueberry.
thanks.

well maybe, maybe she is with us right now?
okay now joey, y'know that since you are returning all of this stuff right after the audition you are going to have to wear underwear?
okay, it is missing something. ooh, i know! umm, okay. (goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to joey.)
it is not a purse! it is a shoulder bag.
no joey, look. trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. look. (shows him.) see look, men, carrying the bag.
exactly! unisex!
no! no joey! you-n-i-sex.
(entering) joey, what are you doing with the bag? you are audition is not until tomorrow.
joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can not return it.
all right, then you owe me $350.
(glaring at him) joey…
hey, do not listen to them. i think it is sexy.
hi sweetie!
why?! why not?!
okay.
ahhh, i think you look great! that bag is going to get you that part.
ooh, pheebs, what are you going to say? are you going to tell him who you are?
what?! why? joey you were so ready for it!
honey wait, joey, I am sorry i mean as terrific as i think you are with it… (looks for help.)
…i just do not know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
wait a minute! wait a minute! I am not saying that you should not have a bag, i just—it is just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (pause) controversial.
(entering, interrupting them) hey guys! what is... (sees what they are doing and stops, the guys are stunned)
hi!
wow! have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
wow, he is cute, pheebs! but i thought you just started dating that kindergarten teacher.
what-pheebs?! two dates in one day? that is so unlike you.
hi!
and?
well honey, then why do not you break up with one of them?
so pheebs, pick one of them.
(entering with phoebe) this place is amazing.
(standing up) ahh... chandler's on the couch!!
monica's going to marry a millionaire!!!
mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “look how much money we have got!” y'know, i mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! you-you could have like little money place settings. and ah, you could start with a money salad! i mean it will be dry, but people will like it.
oh please, what do you know! you married a lesbian!
oh my god!!! (she holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) sorry, i was just imagining what it would be like to catch the money bouquet.
(entering) hi! okay, do not be mad at me, but i could not resist.
yes, and i know that you would say no if he asked you, but I am sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this donna carin. (shows her the picture.)
oh my god. (starting to cry)
you did not break up with that fireman?
wow!
good, you guys are all here!
well, i have a job interview at ralph lauren tomorrow!
i know!
wh-what?!
anyway, I am going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I will work right under the director, it is the perfect, perfect job for me!
yeah.
of-okay!
hi.
ugh, horrible! i did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
no!
ugh, it was horrible! and-and the interview part went so well, y'know? i even made him laugh. he said something about a boat and i was like, "well, yeah! if you have got enough life jackets!" (she starts laughing; chandler and joey are not amused.) trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
(we see a flashback as rachel describes what happened.) all right, we were shaking hands and he kind of leaned toward me… y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but i totally miss read him and i uhhh… (the flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)
well, i did not know what else to do!
thanks chandler.
i can not believe it! i got a second interview!
what-what, wait a minute, you do not think that is why he wants me back?
i accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, because "let us bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
oh my god! what if he thinks I am the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
maybe. i-i do not know—oh god, how could i be so stupid?!
ohh, well I am not totally back yet, but thank you.
hi!
thank you.
what?
excuse me?
(stopping him) wh-whoa! all right, okay-okay, i see, i see what is going on here! now listen, look-look, I am sorry if i gave you the wrong impression, but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! now even though i (he tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though i kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. i do not want, this job that bad. good day, sir. (she storms out of his office.)
(entering) ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from ralph lauren did too me!
okay-okay that-that is amazing. how did you know that?
oh. (realizes.) ohhhhhhhhh….
ah, first, i-i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
(looks around for the camera) okay. umm, well, first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
now you are probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (she puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. rachel then does not know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and i think that is a big mistake and here is why. i made a huge fool of myself and i came back, that shows courage. when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, i said no. that shows integrity. and, i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) okay umm, now i know i already said courage, but y'know you got to have courage. and umm, and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, i said no and i was not litigious. {by the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  so she did not want to sue him.   do not worry, i had to look it up too.} so there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (pause) courage again, and not litigious. look mr…
zelner! right! i knew that! i really, really want this job and i think, i think i would be really good at it.
(gasps) oh! you are?
really? oh thank you! oh… oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
okay, well then how about a handshake? (she goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) oh god I am sorry! oh god, I am sorry! i did not mean to touch that—i mean you there. there. uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I am going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—hey! I will see you monday! (exits.)
(laughs) i cannot believe ross is buying this!
yeah! oh by the way, thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine.
no, yeah, I have done that.
I have never done that.
um, pheebs, so, you guys just do not get along?
so, is this just going to be you and carol?
well, is not, is not that going to be weird?
(looking at the television) cool... "urkel" in spanish is "urkel."
well, someone was supposed to write "rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing monica’s note stuck to the refrigerator) how long has that been there?
so pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
okay... let me put it this way. anything from crabtree and evelyn?
ooh, okay... good.
oh, well, that should not be so hard, now that you are dating. (imitating men at their worst) "sweetheart, you are fired, but how ’bout a quickie before i go to work?"
you do not even have cats.
we will try to keep it down.
are you seein’ her again tonight?
this is just occurring to you?
(she comforts him too) oh, you are going to be great!
oh, how did she take it?
okay, pheebs, can i ask? so, he is going out with her. i mean, is it really so terrible?
oh... oh, pheebs.
oh please, they have been going out a week. they have not even slept together yet, i mean, that is not serious.
no no no no no. you wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I am takin’  them down. okay? whoa! (screams.)
(to monica) I am okay! I am okay! (she knocks on mr. heckles's window.) mr. heckles, mr. heckles could you help me please?
hi!
welcome home.
oh! look! i have a sonogram picture!
well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh i had just got home from work and ross was already there ‘because i guess he had been hanging out with joey.
and so i had a lot of work to do so ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. and then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere ross comes on to me.
what is?
that-that you came on to me?
but you did! i mean, let us be honest.
you know you kissed me first.
i was sending you signals?
oh please. okay, anyone in this room think that i would send ross begging symbols, please show of hands. (ross raises his hand and no one else.)
okay. so these signals ross, explain this to me, ‘because maybe i need to be more careful. i mean, am i sending you these signals right now?
no please, show me how i begged you!
oh ross!
thank god you are here! you have to help me! were you just talking to yourself?
(entering) hey! is ross still here?
oh really? well how would you like it if i had sex with you and i taped it? (joey smiles luridly) oh forget it! (ross enters.) oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
thank you. (she sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) what? (they all yell again.) you do not want to see this do you?
i am not going to show you this!
i want to see it.
clearly you do not want people to see this tape. now i do not want people to see this tape either, but you so badly do not people to see it makes me want to see it. you see?
ahh, i do not believe you. i think you do not want them to see you begging me. (goes to put the tape in the vcr)
ah, a little preview!
okay, here we go. (pushes play.)
(on tape) oh, thank god you are here! you have to help me! were you just talking to yourself?
there i am.
(on tape) i screwed up so bad, i told monica that i would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and i-i…
(on tape) i-i know—i had put them in…in-in my desk at work and i completely forgot about them until today.
kind of hurtin’ my hand though.
(on tape) (ross hands her a glass of wine) i cannot believe that i did this. especially after monica just went on and on and on about it! (mimicking monica) "okay rachel! here are the invitations rachel! now be very careful rachel! please, drinking no liquids around the invitations rachel!" (she tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) whoa oh! oh-oh-oh! oh…oh-oh-oh…
(on tape) can you believe this is already happening? i mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
(on tape) oh, i remember how we almost. do you think we would have gone through with it? y’know, if we had not gotten caught. do you think we would have done it?
(on tape) oh i wanted to.
(on tape) interesting.
(on tape) oh yeah, sure.
okay, in about ten seconds you are going to see him kiss me.
(on tape) ross did i ever tell you about the time that i went backpacking through western europe?
okay, get ready to see some beggin’!
what?!
what are you talking about?!
how do you know about that story?!
i heard it from my friend irene who heard it from some guy!
no. no, she told me his name was ken adams.
so uh, apparently people are familiar with the europe story?
it was an amazing night.
you think it looked amazing?
yeah, me neither. yet…
yeah, it would be really weird.
good luck to you.
oh please. (he does so.)
you are undressing very quickly.
that is what i was going to say.
thank you! i had just gone to the beach that weekend.
have you been working out?
really? wow, this is so much better than i…
oh! oh!
oh god!
oh, make it stop!
make it stop!!
have to make it stop!!
oh yeah, she can not be herself.
yeah, totally! you are in such good hands. and I am so good with meeting parents. with the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. just kind of like: "oh mr. pincer, i can see where wallis gets his good looks..."
uh, he took the sat's for me.
ssshyeah, well, duh! i mean...
oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. take it from me, moms love me. ross's mom one time actually said I am like the daughter that she never had.
hi.
i just finished getting phoebe all dressed to meet mike's parents. she is so nervous, it is so sweet!
(in disbelief) you what? and i missed it? because i was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
you what? you sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
(disgusted) owwwww...
okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please? please laugh for mommy... (rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... no response from emma...) not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? because mommy can rap... (rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) my name is mommy and I am here to say / that all the babies are... oh, i can not rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i know that you are not going to tell anybody... (rachel's face is telling "oh what am i doing? the things i have to go through... and she starts to rap) i like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can not deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (emma starts to laugh) yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh! oh! (rachel now really gets into it, and her insecure movements start getting better) i like big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can not deny... oh emma you are laughing! oh you are, you really do like big butts, do not you. oh you beautiful little weirdo... (rachel picks up emma and ross now enters)
oh you missed it. she was laughing. oh it was amazing. it was amazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
oh! you know, i just... couple of things i tried ... i just sang a little doo... itsy bitsy spider...
nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass...
so fellas
fellas
has your girlfriend got the butt?
so shake it! (rachel slaps ross's butt on the beat)
shake it! (phoebe, mike, chandler, monica and joey step in)
shake that nasty butt...
one more time from the top... i like big butts and i cannot lie, you other br... (she also turns and sees the gang)
how does going to a strip club help him better?
um-hmm. (joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves rachel staring at his ass.) there we go. there it is.
yeah!
oh, okay. uhh, well let us see. (grabs his hand.) you are about—well uh, this one is large. and this one—(grabs the other hand.)
yeah! okay, two larges coming right up!
yes.
sure. you got it. great!
me, fledermaus, great. i really—(motions to joshua.)
so? (she puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)
ohh! right! right, sorry, I will be right back!
oh.
no! nothing!
yeah! that would be great!
(shocked) well, i-i guess—i…
yeah, great, you betcha!
what?
oh. oh, right.
oh yay!
(entering) hey!
hey, monica!
ohh, it is joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. but, i already told mr. waltham that i would take his niece to this dumb old opera. so… what are you going to do?
no! help me!
phoebe?
ugh!
ohh, gosh. you guys, come on, this is—i have to meet joshua! this is my one chance for him to see the fun rachel. y’know the "would not it be great if she was my wife" rachel. ohh, all right! are joey and chandler back?
ohh! (realises that ross is in the room.) hi!
so….
ohhhh, come on!!!
no! wait! wait-wait! ross, please!
I will be right there! (to ross) okay, ross, please come on! i thought we have moved on! i thought we have gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! i mean was that just me?
oh thank you! thank you, thank you, thank you! (monica opens the door.) emily?
I am rachel green.
there is been a teeny-teeny change in plans. it turns out that I am not free tonight. so…
oh well, no i…
I will get her.
hey—whoa, slow down. (gets a whiff of him) no, keep moving. (joey runs off.) wow!
well, i did not see joshua last night, but i did punch a girl in the face.
the whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when i got there, there was no rachel green on the list, but there was a rachel greep.
no, there is no rachel greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I am rachel greep! I am rachel greep!" and he let her right in.
no, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so i clocked her. ohhh! i can not believe this, all i wanted was a few hours outside of work to see joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
honey, that is you are name.
what? who the hell is emily—(realises) noooo!!
they are in vermont!! how could this happen?! (she waves her arms franticly and hits chandler.)
how—how did end up in vermont with that awful witch?! (she hits chandler again.)
i do not get this! she was horrible! (she hits chandler, yet again.)
i do not care! all right, y’know what I am just upset that I am getting nowhere with joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to vermont!
oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (storms out.)
(joining them) well, i just checked our messages and joshua did not call. i mean you would think he would be worried about me not showing up at his club. ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, ross is all happy in vermont!
(entering) i can not believe it! he still has not called.
it is joshua.
no, i do not.
yeah, come on! what is going in on in there? (pats his chest.)
see, i do not know, for me it would have to chantal.
oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! i mean when i stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
well, are we all together? like in a group?
oh, hey!
what?
oh, hmm.
joshua.
yeah, i…
oh, thank goodness!
oh, no problem. I am so glad i could help. happy for you. (she playfully punches him.)
no, happy for you! (hits him harder.)
no-no-no, that’ not joshua.
hey!
okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
closer than here?
wait, I am not just going to drink somebody is old coffee.
(softly) is he here?
oh. (smiles) here is your moisturiser. hi!
you guys are going to love meee! okay, check it out, thursday night, five tickets, calvin klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they are all silent and look away) okay, i said that out loud right?
oh, well okay. well, there you go.
hm-mm.
ohh!
oh, it is okay. (starts to leave)
and heels.
no, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that is only fair. (leaves)
hi! uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? because i have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. huh? I am asking you first, right?!. i mean I am playing by the rules.
chandler! you are smoking? what are you doing?!
okay.
no. thank you.
well, they never have any paper in there y'know. so my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (phoebe laughs and gets out.) well, if everybody’s going. (she gets out and starts to close the door.)
what?!
what, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small i mean, i-i-i actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
no, i stuff outside the bra.
(seeing him) chandler, what are you doing? there is a trash can right there.
what, what is it, what is going on?
so you know how to fix it?
great!
yeah, we are definitely on route 27.
i do not know, I am sorry, i always slept in the back when we drove up here.
ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
no! no, i am not getting in a car with ross, we will just have to live here!
no you guys, i am not getting in a car with him, you will have to think of something else.
(all excited) op, op, car! car!! (sees it is ross) ugh!!!
what is he doing here?!
all right!! fine! fine.
ask me what?
you guys are unbelievable. no! he cannot come.
why would you even want to come ross? you are a horrible skier.
all right, let us go!
oh, I am sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
y'know ross why do not you put that on your answering machine!
(to monica) what?!
really joey?
no, i think it is very obvious who is wrong here.
yeah.
thank you.
yeah, i can not *wait* to go back to work.
okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet.
we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
do not worry, we are just going to search here for an hour, and then we are going to go over to joey's and search, ok?
chandler, are not you worried about what to get monica for christmas?
chandler, that is not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you have just gotten her one great present? i mean that is just going to make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?
that is right!
oh, it is a macy's bag!
oh.
(reading from a tag that is attached to the shoe) "dear losers, do you really think I would hide presents under the couch? p.s.: chandler, i knew they would break you."
wiper blades. i do not even have a car.
(interrupting him) oh chandler, stop talking!
(opens her present from ross; it is a dark-red scarf) oohh, i love it!
well, not this second!
oh wow, it is so beautiful...
what do you really want to do?
wha... are you kidding? i can not return this.
oh god monica hi! thank god! i just went to your building and you were not there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
hi, sure!
oh god... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and i was looking at this gravy boat. this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat. when all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)sweet 'n' lo?- i realized that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry! and then i got really freaked out, and that is when it hit me: how much barry looks like mr. potato head. y'know, i mean, i always knew looked familiar, but... anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering 'why am i doing this, and who am i doing this for?'. (to monica) so anyway i just did not know where to go, and i know that you and i have kind of drifted apart, but you are the only person i knew who lived here in the city.
ooh, i was kind of hoping that would not be an issue... [scene: monica's apartment, everyone is there and watching a spanish soap on tv and are trying to figure out what is going on.]
(on phone) daddy, i just... i can not marry him! I am sorry. i just do not love him. well, it matters to me!
c'mon daddy, listen to me! it is like, it is like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you are a shoe! you are a shoe, you are a shoe, you are a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i do not want to be a shoe? what if i want to be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, I am not saying i want you to buy me a hat, I am saying i am a ha- it is a metaphor, daddy!
look daddy, it is my life. well maybe I will just stay here with monica.
well, maybe that is my decision. well, maybe i do not need your money. wait!! wait, i said maybe!!
I am all better now.
please, no, go, that would be fine!
well, i was kind of supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
well actually thanks, but i think I am just going to hang out here tonight.  it is been kind of a long day.
barry, I am sorry... i am so sorry... i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it is not... it is not, it is about me, and i ju- (she stops talking and dials the phone.) hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs. barry finkel, but it is not me, it is not me.  and not that i have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (the maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
oh...see... but joanne loved chachi! that is the difference!
is not this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life.
y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there is not anything i can not do.
hello, paul.
so, like, you guys all have jobs?
wow! would i have seen you in anything?
i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
oh, yeah.
oh wow. are you in trouble.
want a wedding dress?   hardly used.
oh, look, wish me luck!
I am going to go get one of those (thinks) job things.
guess what?
are you kidding? I am trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off!
they are my new 'i do not need a job, i do not need my parents, I have got great boots' boots!
uh, credit card.
um... my... father.
oh god, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  i mean, i can stop charging anytime i want.
i know that. that is why i was getting married.
thank you.
no.  no, no, I am not ready!  how can i be ready?  "hey, rach!  you ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  come on, i can not do this!
i do not think so.
y'know what?  i think we can just leave it at that.  it is kind of like a symbolic gesture...
hey mon, look what i just found on the floor. (monica smiles.) what?
sorry-
no, you have it, really, i do not want it-
okay.
i knew.
i did.
yeah, maybe...
goodnight.
(walks up with a pot of coffee) would anybody like more coffee?
I am just serving it.
ugh. (to another customer that is leaving.) excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (hands him the coffee pot.) go ahead. (he does so.) thank you. (to the gang.) sorry.  okay, las vegas.
pheebs? could you get that? please?
no! no! it is just that all the people in the entire world that i want to talk to are right here.
(under her breath) sucker!
(entering with ross) hi!
well, i guess i could take a couple days off work.
oh no, wait a minute, wait, I have got a presentation tomorrow. i can not miss that.
that sounds great.
okay. yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
no! so i can be by myself. y'know? have a little alone time.
no! phoebe just because I am alone does not mean i want to walk around naked. i mean, you live alone, you do not walk around naked.
(takes off her robe) oh! look what happened! {do not get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. its times like these i wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than denis franz's butt.} (in her head.) huh, check me out! I am in my kitchen…naked! I am picking up an orange. (does so) I am naked! (goes into the living room) lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (she backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)
(singing) love to love ya baby! ow! love to love ya baby! ow! (there is a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) love to love ya, baby! (there is another knock.) darnit! (looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) ugh. (she opens the door to ross who is leaning against the door jam.)
uh, yeah, if you want too.
yeah, sure?
and um, what-what is that ross?
(laughs) what?! are you crazy?
(gasps) oh god, you saw me?! oh!
noo!! no! you thought, you actually thought i wanted to have sex with you?!
ohh wow! I am sorry, but ross you kicked off your shoes!
yes of course, absolutely! you are right. I am sorry.
yes.
okay. oh wait! one more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
(taking off her sweater) okay umm, ross? I am-I am really warm, so I am going to be taking off my sweater. now, I am just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
I am sorry. I am done. I am done.
no, not really. i mean you have seen me naked hundreds of times.
okay. all right, that is true! but y'know i just do not embarrass that easily.
no, i do not! ross, i think I am just a more secure person than you are.
yeah.
yeah, all right. all right! just keep walkin'! all right?
ross! what are you… I am sorry sir. i just, i think he just really likes you.
(to the flight attendant who appears in record time. it was only seconds after rachel pushed the call button was she there. once again, more proof that tv is not real, irl she would have been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then ross's pants would be dry.) hi!
yes, I am sorry. do you have any extra pants? umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
yes, i did. thank you very much, it was excellent. (disembarks)
ahh.
hello! (she makes a face and the kid laughs harder. finally, his parents drag him off.) ohh, kids love me.
hi! (hugs phoebe)
pancho vila?
what are you talking about pheebs? (takes out her compact) i do not… (she gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (to ross) oh my god, you drew on me?!
ross, i have been walking around like this since the plane! i can—you have so crossed a line. (heads for the bathroom)
(returning with her purse covering her face) all right, it will not come off!
it will not come off!
no, actually i took it off then i drew it back on.
hi!!
hi. (she hugs joey.)
what?! what else did he say?
ross, no! there is no way i am leaving this room looking like this!
ross, i am a human doodle!!
okay, i need a, i need a drink! (makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
(she is finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) macadamia nut?
hm-mmm! (opens the container)
nope! (she puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)
oh my god, I am starting to look like my great aunt, muriel.
hit me!
i bet 20.
hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (she slows down with each one.)
yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. hold on a second. (gets up but stumbles a little bit.) whup, okay. (she makes it to the phone and picks it up, without dialing.) hello! vegas? yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? we would like some more beers. hello? ohh, i forgot to dial!
ohh, i love joey! joey lives with a duck! (goes and hugs joey.)
hey!
I am doing good, baby. how you doing?
ohhh!!
oops! all right, so what do you want to do now?
okay, y'know what? there is only one way I am leaving this hotel room.
good luck to ya!
wow!
(bowing) hello!
well, hello, mr. rachel! (throws some more rice.)
wait! (gets her bearings) okay!
i do not know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls at the party, god!
(worried) be-because ross is the father of my child! you know... and i... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) i just... all I am saying is... i do not think that joey and charlie have anything in common.
all right, so... ross, you are ok with all this? i mean...
oh, oh! wow, i love those! where did you get them?
(after a pause) phoebe, shania twain is still alive!
oh, it is a gift certificate to this new spa in soho.
ah, why, now i can not get a massage? there are so many things that she disapproves of! i can not eat veal, i can not wear fur, i can not go hunting...
well, i would like to have the option!!
oh!
phoebe, come on, i do not want to waste it! it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
i do not care about any of that!!
oh!
oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i will not use it!
i promise.
but i am going hunting!!
(to the receptionist) hi there!
oh, hi. i have a massage appointment under rachel green, and here is my gift certificate.
and... taped back together.
ok
(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
alright-y then.
wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person. (puts her head in the hole and phoebe enters)
oh... what an interesting name.
you know i... (lifts her head and tries to look in phoebe's direction)
(sees phoebe's slippers through the hole) wow... i really love your... (startled as she realizes those are phoebe's slippers)
no, it is just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea... (pause) yeah, say hey, you will know this, what is the capital of sweden?
damn! i wish i knew if that was right!
wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have a friend who is a masseuse.
yah! she is... uhm... not very good though... (phoebe looks devastated)
i do not know... maybe it is because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
(now lifts her head) phoebe!!
for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!
how could you not tell me you worked here?
yes you do, if you are going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i do not have any!
good for you pheebs!
wow! what did he do?
i can not. I am busy. I am apartment hunting.
yeah, i can not live with joey once the baby comes. i do not want my child’s first words to be, (in a baby’s voice) "how you doing?"
well, i have not discussed it with him yet, but i know he is going to be relieved. last week, he brought this girl over and i started talking to her about morning sickness and then i showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
not so much.
oh my god! was she old? does she have a view?
yeah that would really be great.
well can we see it?! oh maybe we should not. i mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
shall we?
and I am rachel, an admirer of the building.
ahh.
so she is really not dead.
hmm. do you think—could you tell me if she is hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
hey!
how was the game?
oh.
oh yeah! hopefully across the street if certain dutch people would just let go.
oh but joey, i have to go. there is no room for a baby here.
honey, it is not just a matter of where you put it. i mean a baby changes everything. they cry all the time. i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there is a screaming baby around.
honey, it is so sweet that you want me to stay, but i-i can not do that to you. i mean it would disrupt your entire life.
i know.
i do too a little bit.
hi!
you gave them to me!
all right, i took them. but i figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
what bra?
you mean the one that you are wearing? (adjusts monica’s pink bra strap as monica looks down her shirt.)
what is this?
you are so sweet. (notices something in the crib.) oh my god! and you gave the baby hugsy! (a stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)
but joey the baby is going to be crying, it is going to be loud.
it is going to be up all night!
it is going to poop!
what about all the women you want to bring home?
joey, are you sure?
i want me to stay too.
thank you. (they hug.) oh joey and look at this crib! it is so cute!
are you serious—really?! it is in such good condition.
wow! whoa-whoa what is under the covers?
it is moving.
it is still—(screams)—it is got a tail! get it out of here! get it out of here!!
ewww. yeah. umm. i think I am going to stay here.
(joining phoebe outside) hey pheebs.
any sign of your brother?
i thought you only met him once?
well relax, he will be here.
well, actually gunther sent me. you are not allowed to have cups out here, it is a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)
now, you do realize that she is a cartoon, and way out of your league?
oh, i do not know, i guess, chris of’donnel, john f. kennedy, jr., daniel day lewis, sting, and parker stevenson.
hardy boy.
what about you honey, who would be on your list?
hi!
well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
three of your five, what?
oh my god! you are giving this a lot of thought.
so?
yeah, ‘because that is why you will not get isabella rosselini, geography.
well, it is about time.
all right let me see. (grabs the card) uma thurman, winona ryder, elizabeth hurely, michelle pfieffer, and dorothy hammel?
okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
oh!
come on!
okay sir, um-mm, let see if i got this right. ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) you freak.
oh-oh, you lie.
ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
you know what honey, you go ahead, we will call her an alternate.
okay.
honey, he is about to go hit on isabella rosselini. I am just sorry we do not got popcorn.
everybody? shh, shhh. uhhh... central perk is proud to present the music of miss phoebe buffay.
wow, this is so cool, you guys. the entire city is blacked out!
wow, you guys, this is big.
that had to hurt!
alright, somebody.
um... ross?
oh come on, i already went.
oh, alright. the weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed.
i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
there, well, see? barry would not even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
no, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
i mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
yeah right.
(sigh) ok.
you do not.
really?
you do?
oh ross, you are so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
what are you shushing?
ahhhh!
huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
hmmm... this is so nice.
ok.
ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind ross)
oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind ross)
during a blackout? he would get trampled!
oh. (they knock at the next door, mr. heckles answers) hi. we just found this cat and we are looking for the owner.
bob buttons?
here, kitty-kitty. here kitty-kitty. where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
(entering with paolo, arm in arm) everybody, this is paolo. paolo, i want you to meet my friends. this is monica.
and joey....
and ross.
(proudly) he does not speak much english.
look at that!
oh... italy, i think.
well, the cat... the cat turned out to be paolo's cat!
oh, i found him. he was paolo's cat.
ah, paolo, this is phoebe.
i have absolutely no idea.
(to monica and phoebe) oh my god, you guys, what am i doing? what am i doing? this is so un-me!
god, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in bermuda with barry.
y'know, i know it is totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we do not even speak the same language but goooooooddddddd....
what?
oh yeah, i know, but the garbage was full.
well, i thought you liked doing it. (rachel starts out the door and stops.)
right!
oh! hey, mr. treeger.
ummm. oh! I am sorry. (she grabs the box and offers him a piece.) it is a little old but…
I am sorry. i did not—i do not come in here a lot.
no.
i did not… i never said that.
(starting to cry) okay, I am sorry. (runs out still carrying the pizza box.)
yes! and he said really mean things that were only partly true.
that is easy for you to say, you were not almost just killed.
oh pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
oh! my hero! what happened?
what?! you got us evicted!!
that is not true! (starts to cry.)
go!!
well, why does not he practice with a girl?
yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute. (starts to cry)
hey! so, did you quit?
oh, umm, i was just y’know working out and umm… oh, that is it.
where?!
(laughing) what was that?
you just did a little dancy thing.
you are soo enjoying this.
ooh, this is soo sweet, joey our little twinkle-toes.
what are you ever going to use that for?!
you got fired?!
sweety...
they made you head of the department!
yeah.
uh, paul’s caf�. they got great food and it is really romantic.
yeah! oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the four seasons for drinks. or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. or dancing—oh! take her dancing!
ooh, i miss dating. gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I am not going to be able to do that for so long, and it is so much fun! i mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
huh?
what?! joey, you do not want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
(interrupting) okay! I will go with ya! I will go! I will go with ya.
all right?
joey? could you get that? (there is no answer and she goes and opens the door to joey.) what are you doing here? i thought you were in your room?
ohh, lilies. joey, they are my favorite. thank you.
oh man! this is so great! i actually feel like I am going on a real date! although, i have a hint of morning sickness, and I am wearing underwear that goes up to about…(she snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)…there.
yeah, actually that is my roommate’s.
ah yes, but he is very protective of me so you would better watch yourself.
hm-mmm.
(laughs) yeah, but I am pretty sure he is gay.
now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
emmm. now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway i can substitute the three-pound lobster?
wow! this is shaping up to be a pretty good date—oh, i almost forgot. i did not pay you the rent check.
okay. wow! so i get to see what joey tribbiani is like on a date. so do you have any moves?
i knew it! i knew it. come on tell me your moves.
oh my god. and that works?!
oh, you poor little famous man.
(looks interested) oh my god! wow! that was fantastic, i almost leaned in. i really almost did!
alright. so where did you grow up?
come on, just answer the question!
and so were-were you close to your parents?
why not?
(sympathetic) oh. (starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) it is got to be rough.
huh?
thank you! and now if you will excuse me, i have to go to the rest room.
and now you are watching me walk away.
i am not going to answer that!
no one! they are my friends, i would not punch any of them.
yeah, but i do not know why. look at me, I am having such a wonderful time!
i know!
joey, i think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
all right, now do not judge me. i normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I am ripping into this swan.
so tell me, what are joey tribbiani’s end of the night moves?
how do you do that?
oh my god!
no, i do not want to tell you.
because it is embarrassing.
(laughs) okay. all right, stand up. (they do so.) well, when we are at the door, i lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then i make this sound, "hmmm." okay, i know it does not sound like anything, but i swear it works.
all right, i got to go to bed. honey, i had such a wonderful time.
…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
well, why did not you just take a cab?
well you are not going to be able to keep doing this.
you what?
right. wow!
hi! hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie cujo?
relax! it is not like it is citizen kane!
yeah i know it is really boring, but it is like a big deal. anyway, i was thinking about renting cujo sometime.
well do not you have that big date tonight?
hey joey, can i ask you something?
after our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
i do not know! (pause) I am-I am kind of thinking it-it was the lobster…
yeah, i mean i was up sick all night.
really?! how come we did not cross paths?
oh god! thank god you are home! I am watching cujo.
yes! but what is wrong with this dog?!
no! no! seriously, what is wrong with the dog?! wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? what happened to your date?
oh. do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
y’know, i never thought I would say this about a movie, but i really hope this dog dies. (joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to rachel who is in the big chair.) what are you doing over there? come sit here, you protect me.
okay. (pushes play.) okay, that is him! that is him! that is cujo! that is cujo!
oh my god….what is he going to do now? i can not watch! (drags joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) oh. seriously, how can you watch this? are not you scared?
hi you guys!
oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
no. i was just going to do this myself. (joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
yeah, why? you do not think a woman can do this?
monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?
wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!
there is a hardware store right down the street?
this is easy...can not do this! (moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) oh! wow! seriously i can not do this. (fiddles more)
hi!
yeah, i do not know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.
oh thank you so much. (picks up the guy's spirit level) oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game. (hands it to him)
do not look at me i never get his jokes.
just when you thought that dude could not get any wierder.
i do not know! i mean, what brought that on?
no you really think that is what it is?
yeah! if you do not i will! of course your body's going to change. your breasts are going to get bigger, your ass is going to get bigger, you are going to lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) god! it is just such a magical time!
argh. fascist
man, do not be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
oh my god chandler! if you can not handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that is shooting out of her!?
joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?
yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (she suddenly let us go) i mean not for me because I am only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
I am so sorry pheebs.
well, hello, mr. rachel! (throws some more rice.)
wait! (gets her bearings) okay!
ohhh! (looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.)
i do not know. do-do you have any clothes on?
really?!
oh! i remember laughing! i laughed a lot.
ohh, i mean, we were really drunk. I am just glad we did not do anything stupid.
(to ross) i do not know. (to the gang.) what do you mean last night? nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
(gasps) who got married?! (ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
no, we did not get married! that is ridiculous!
oh my god.
no!
well, i guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (looks at ross.)
hey, hubby!
uh-huh.
okay! so, we will just stay married.
and i will make everyone call me mrs. geller!
okay, see now I am scared because i do not actually think you are kidding.
what-wh-what so we will just stay married forever?!
ohh, okay, I am sorry. you are right. y’know what? we absolutely can stay married, because i was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. all right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you are asking of me.
you are asking me to be your wife!
hey!
(thinks about it for a second) no! ross, come on! no! listen, look i thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, ross, is we can not stay married.
oh b-b-but it is!
oh ross, come on! this is not, this is not a marriage!! this is the world’s worst hangover! ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, i will!
thank you. (he goes to leave.) hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
huh, that is funny. you look like you are going to be the…
all right. okay chandler, enjoy your handful. (exits.)
hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
ross, thank you. hey, do you guys want to go see a movie?
pheebs?
okay, umm, I am going to get my sweater. (walks away.)
yeah but y’know what they say mon, "there is no such thing as bad press."
i did not write it.
ross!
i am freaking out!
my due date is in one week!
that is seven days!
(interrupting him) no-no-no-no-no ross! please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! we do not a changing table! we do not have a crib! we do not have a diaper service!
I am serious.
okay. thank you. that is great. thank you. wait-wait! where on west 10th? because there is this really cute shoe store that has like this little…
(stopping him) oh, wait ross! I am sorry, one more thing!
umm, our situation. y’know umm, what we mean to each other. and i mean we-we are having this baby together, and we live together. is not that, is not that weird?
I am just kidding! you can go pee! (he does so in a hurry.)
oh.
no-no-no! no, no, no, we are not married.
oh yeah! actually, that is one of the reasons why we are not a couple.
oh. oh yeah, do not get to worked up over it. i mean it-it sounds like he is a doctor, but he is not.
oh my god! I am standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I am bored.
hi pheebs!
oh, it was great! we got everything that we needed! oh and ross, almost got something that was not on the list. a who are.
well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
yeah.
you do not understand! you did not see how brazen she was.
no! I am not! i-i-i just think it is wrong! it is-it is that I am—here i am about to pop and he is out picking up some shop girl at sluts ‘r’ us!
oh yeah! you really—you look great.
chandler, I am not going to lie to ya, but i am going to run away from you. (gets up and hurries out.)
all this stuff takes up a lot of room. hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping ben in your life?
horny bitch. (they both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs she is holding are arguing.) no! you are a horny bitch! noooo! you are the horny bitch! no! you are a horny bitch!
so you guys go, have a really good time.
so, you had a good day huh? big commission; picked up a daddy.
oh yeah! yeah please, you guys have fun.
oh and it was great to see you too. and you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
oh okay, i see what you are doing there.
hi! you are back from your date!
I am fine, but that is not important. what is important is how was she?
oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
no! no, she is—she was nice. i mean, she is a little slutty, but who is not?
of course you did ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you indiana jones!
no! it is just that, kate bothered me.
there was nothing wrong with her! all right? she was perfectly lovely!
i do not want you to date her!
yes! and not because i want you to go out with me, but because i do not want you to go out with anybody! okay? i know it is a terrible thing to even think this, and it is completely inappropriate, but i want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I am very sorry, but that is just the way that i feel.
what?!
really? but I am being so unreasonable.
(starting to cry) oh ross, thank you. thank you. (they hug.)
no, not really. you are pressing the baby into my bladder and now i have to pee. sorry. (she gets up and starts for the bathroom.)
yeah. (stops and starts doing the i-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
uh-huh.
(pause) wow! i do not know, maybe. I am…
(laughs) i knew that! i knew that! i was just messin’ with you too!
oh no-no-no-no, no!
no that is just—(laughs)—that is just ‘because I am such a good messer!
yeah?
right! (heads for the bathroom.)
all right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (she makes a move for the remote.)
honey, what are you doing? that is too heavy.
give it here. (she takes the table.) oh, god. (and gives it to monica right away.)
is that the heartbeat?
oh wow! this is so cool.
well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
what is that song? it has been in my head all day long.
y’know who does not even like dirty movies? my new boyfriend joshua.
no, he told me. he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
yes!
I am going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (as she exits, phoebe enters.) hey, pheebs!
hey!
well, so, why do not you just turn it off?
well, what-what ‘cha got there?
honey, you are not going to make enough money to help frank and alice just by selling knives.
hey!
well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
okay.
(interrupting) relaxi-taxi!
well, well i can up with it!
well, i…
okay, it is not relaxi cab. it is relaxicab, like taxicab.
he offered me one.
the job is in paris. (we see ross stare in disbelief)
oh, god! please, somebody say something.
i know, it is huge, and it is scary, and it is... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. and I have already talked to them about our situation with emma, and they said they will do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
i mean, I will fly back and forth, they will fly you out... anything we want.
thank you! thank you!
i think it is. (ross looks very sad. phoebe and joey enter.)
i got a really incredible job offer.
it is in paris.
look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. and it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
(walking towards joey) joey, it would mean so...
joey...
hi.
oh, well, she is asleep now. stop forcing that thing on her.
oh, you are not going to believe what happened to me today! ralph lauren called, and gave me my job back!
yee. i mean, it was so weirdest thing. they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! i mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
no, I am still going.
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! is not that great?
hi!
you are never going to believe what happened to me today.
ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money.
yeah. it was the weirdest thing. zelner called me and he said we will do everything we can to get you back. and that i should thank some ron... i do not even know what department that guy's in.
well, i took it.
(hesitant) ye-ah. yeah! you know, the money's great. it is certainly the easier choice...
yeah, you know, was i looking forward to going to paris? sure. you know, was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? ooh, absolutely... oh...! yeah, but you know, this is... it is fine. I am fine going back to a job where I have pretty much gotten everything out of that i possibly can... (she sits down, and ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)
well yeah, but i mean, it was good scared though, you know? like when i-moved-to-new-york scared. or uhm, when i-found-out-i-was-going to-have-emma scared... but this is... fine. this is going to be good. (they both stare around)
what?
you really think so?
but i already told zelner that i would come back...
all right. all right! I am going to do it. I am going to go to paris.
yeah! I am going to paris. thank you, ross!
oh! oh, I am so happy.
all right, i got 48.
(counting the place settings) how come we have one extra place setting?
oh, right. sorry. but tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he is spending thanksgiving with her.
well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know... you are food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
seriously, it is moving!
(gets up and opens the door) hi tag! what are you doing here?
well, sure! come in! (he enters) well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
oh, I am sorry.
wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies?
oh, wait before you guys go, can i just ask you a question?
when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
interesting.
huh. a moo-point?
(to monica and phoebe) have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
you are right, I am sorry. thank you. okay, that is what I am going to do.
hey!
how are you holding up?
yeah? I am sorry about your girlfriend.
so were you guys together a long time?
now that she broke up with you?
yeah. hmmmm.
no…yeah, all the time, constantly. it is terrifying. but you know that i figure it…it has to work out.
because, uh—it has to.
yeah, i know, i do. i really do.
well, what is a boss for? hug it out! (they hug)
uh, yeah, well, see, he… joey knows, that I am-I am very insecure about my back and, and…you are hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
no? (he shakes his head) all right, here is the truth um, joey said what he said, because um, I am attracted to you.
yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that is crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
what?
okay, that is going to take them a minute. do you have anything else you want to get off your chest?
(she hurries after him) wait, we still have time to talk and they are-they are not even in the car yet! (she takes a quick look down the street.) oh look, there they go, okay. (she hurries in, too)
yeah, ohh! why, damnit, why did i open my mouth? (in a girlish voice) i have a crush on you; i am attracted to you. (back to normal again) gee, i-i know that i freaked him out
(gasps) hi!
(uncovers the dog) hi!
oh, hi! how are you doing?
oh.
look, um, i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
ah, i-i never should have said what i said. it—y’know what? it just does not matter how i feel. i mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what i would love is just to go to work on monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? big day monday lots to do. so, we are okay?
oh, god, i know it, that i freaked you out.
really?
okay, well, that is one less thing we have to do on monday.
(reading the program) ooh! look! look! look! look, there is joey's picture! this is so exciting!
god. i feel violated.
oh, c'mon. she is a person, you can do it!
what is it?
tah-daaah!
look! i cleaned! i did the windows, i did the floors... i even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, i do not know what that is for.
well, whaddya think?
i dunno.. i-i thought it looked better there. and i- and also, it is an extra seat around the coffee table.
okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and i buy laundry detergent, but it is not the one with the easy-pour spout.
..you are, you are 'mah mah mah' what?
who is being loud?
ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment?
oh, joey, you know what, no-one is going to be able to tell.
uh, mon, you-you going to leave your shoes out here?
really? just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
so i do not go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that emma could get a chance to know her.
that is great, great. so do you have any questions for us?
allright. well thank you so much for coming... (they are standing up and make their way to the door)
really nice to meet you... and we will call you.
okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while ross crumples up the application form) wow! we are never going to find a nanny.
(indignant) what, the blonde with no bra?
okay... (ross opens the door.)
sandy, that is exactly what it is...
ross!
oh!
oh, that is pretty.
oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
oh, that would be great! (sandy leaves for emma's room) i love him, i love him, i love him...
so wh..? he is smart, he is qualified. give me one good reason we should not try him out.
why?
(she is got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) yes?
(whispering and begging) please? (ross makes a "whatever" gesture) yes! sandy you are hired.
oooh... ***i really can not hear what she says*** come here.
(in a tearful voice) oh... oh boy... (she turns around and sees ross) hi...
oh yeah, it is fine, it is fine. sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
i can not... i can not hear it again.
yeah! (to sandy) excuse me... (she walks to the kitchen with ross and sighs)
look, ross, he is just... sandy is just sensitive, that is all.
what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby?
sandy made madeleines.
well, i... you know, i-i-i do not know what to say... i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, because i got to tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
okay, what? what is too sensitive? (there is music coming from the living room. ross opens the door to the living room and he and rachel see sandy play a song for emma on his recorder. rachel is moved by this, but ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. the door he was holding, swings back and hits rachel.)
that was kind of rude!
you know, he was just doing his job...
oh, come on ross...
(sighs) oh... that is true.
well, you are the one who wants to fire him, so you are going to have to do it. (ross walks to the living room determined to fire sandy)
i can not watch. it is like firing elmo. (ross walks to the couch where sandy sits)
(from behind the bedroom door) you! you feel!
(from bedroom) oh, damn you geller!
(from the bedroom) huh ha ha!
come on! you guys can pee standing up.
(waitressing) does anybody want anything else?
it is my father. he wants to give me a mercedes convertible.
yeah, well, it is a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady.
oh, yeah, yeah. actually, i got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "you will never make it on your own".
oh, big glamour night. me and monica at laundorama.
who?
do not you have a laundry room in your building?
sure.
oh, 'scuse me. i was kind of using that machine.
but i saved it. i put my basket on top.
what?
hi, uh, nothing. that horrible woman just took my machine.
yeah, but, there were no suds.
well, you know, no suds, no save.
that was amazing. i can not even send back soup.
what is that?
oh god. oh, am i being like a total laundry spaz? i mean, am i supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
well, not myself, but i know other people that have. ok, you caught me. I am a laundry virgin.
(holds a pair of panties in front of ross) ok, well, what about these are white cotton panties. would they go with whites or delicates?
ok, i know this is going to sound really stupid, but i feel that if i can do this, you know, if i can actually do my own laundry, there is not anything i can not do.
what uh-oh?
ross, what is the matter?
come on, show me.
oh, everything's pink.
except it did not. it happened to me. oh, god, I am going to look like a big marshmallow peep. what am i doing? what am i doing? my father's right. i can not live on my own! i can not even do laundry!
oh, i guess. except everything looks like jammies now.
whoa, I am sorry. excuse me. we had this cart.
I am sorry, you know, maybe i was not being clear. uh, this is our cart.
hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
all right, listen, missy. if you want this cart, you are going to have to take me with it!
(to ross) yes! did you see that?
i could not have done this without you.
are you sure?
oh, are you sure you are ok?
does it still hurt?
where is chandler?
(looking at her watch) oh my god, i got to go to work!
oh i do not know honey. it is going to be really late.
i know. I am sorry. look, I will make a deal with you all right? okay?
for every night that you are asleep before i get home from work...
i will wake you up in a way that is proved very popular in the past.
right.
somebody got in late last night.
when did this happen?
monica, what are you doing?
(entering) hey.
do you have any ice?
yeah, i know. i had the greatest day though, i got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from calvin klien. i told my boss i liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. how was your day?
hmm. (she opens the freezer) umm, why do you have a copy of the shining in your freezer?
but ah, you are safe from it if it is in the freezer?
how often do you read it?
well, umm, i guess i read little women more than once. but i mean that is a classic, what is so great about the shining?
okay. ah, well we will just see about that, okay. i will read the shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he does not want to let it go) and you will read little women.
all right.
okay.
yeah.
oh, danny just went into room 217.
oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you are going to ruin it!
joey! i can not believe you just did that!
all right, okay, laurie proposes to jo, and she says no, even though she is still in love with him, and then he ends up marring amy.
eh. beth dies.
um-hmm.
what?!
no. she does not die.
because, i wanted to hurt you.
(gasps) oh my....
(screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) sorry. I am sorry.
I am sorry, i was just thinking you are day could still pick up.
what?
awwww.
joey?
do you want to put the book in the freezer?
okay.
good ones?
well, can i keep the presents and still be 29?
y’know, I am still 29 in guam.
late thirties? oh come on you guys! is it just me? am i overreacting to this?
look, y’know i know my life’s going pretty well, but i look around and i just see so many people who have accomplished so many other goals by the time they are thirty.
there you go!
thirty. ugh, i mean thirty! monica, do you remember mean, old mrs. kreeger in the fifth grade? she was thirty!
nothing. i do not want to do anything.
really! god ross, what were you thinking? (to phoebe, quietly) i know it is really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
y’know what? i am going to do something today. I am not just going to sit around like some old lady. I am going to get something pierced. like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
so what?! y’know what? the way i see it—(phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)—ow! son of a bitch!!
(glares at him) get out, get out of my apartment.
(entering) hey! everybody hide! hide! i saw her! she is coming!
what is-what is going on? phil’s really pissed!
okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for joey.
ahh!
(opening it) a scooter! (she is not happy.)
no! no-no, i love it. thank you. (kisses him.)
okay.
okay. (opens the card and reads it.) happy birthday grandma! it is better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (breaks down as everyone glares at them.) all our love monica and chandler. (crying) that is funny, yeah!
(crying) no, i know! i get it! it is funny!
no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i do not have any of those things. that is why it is so funny. (runs into her room crying.)
well, i feel fine, but i think you are bumming out the rest of the kids.
okay! y’know what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i want to have three kids…
as i was saying… i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I am 35 which gives me five years. i love this plan! i want to marry this plan!
so, if i want to have my kid when I am 35, i do not have to get pregnant until I am 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant…
no, so i do not have to get married until I am 33! that is three years, that is three whole years—oh, wait a minute though. I will need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I would like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… which means i need to meet the guy by the time I am thirty.
no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i want to marry!
(to chandler) I am telling you it is like watching bambi learn how to walk.
hey. (after she leaves.) oh, poor pheebs.
ross, i really do not think…
hey joey, can i…
actually, i just want to talk to tag.
whatever! okay, I am not your mother.
not in the street!!
(to tag) hi.
hey.
yeah, I am doing okay. I am um…let us talk.
umm…
ohh tag, umm…you are such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but i do not-i do not…
well said. and a uh good example of the fun i was referring to uhh, but i just think I am past the point where i think i can y’know, just have fun.
yeah, it is! but you are just a kid! i mean you are 25!
oh god! y’know what i wish? i wish you were six years older. well actually, if I am wishin’ for stuff, i actually wish i was six years younger.
yeah, I am sorry. (they hug.)
oh, if i only want two kids, can i keep him for another year?
hi! emma will be up in a minute!
oh hey ross... listen, i heard about you and charlie. I am really sorry.
absolutely.
so, uhm... what are you going to do today?
oh my god, what!?
ok, look, ross. i do not want emma going to the playground.
(upset) all right, well, if you must know... i had a traumatic... swing incident... when i was little.
yes, i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. and to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) and it was uneven for weeks!
ok, fine! you can make fun of me. i do not want emma going there. and i was thinking claire danes.
ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! ok? when you are... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just do not know if you are going to return back to earth!
all right!
irrational, huh? all right, well, I will remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
ok, careful.
careful, watch her hair. watch her hair!
i know (she touches emma’s head) but they are just so beautiful! oh, my god, i just pulled one out.
ok.
ok.
ok, careful, ok. (emma giggles) oh, she is smiling! oh my god, she does like it!
awe! (emma laughs) oh my god! looks, she is a little dare-devil! oh, let me push, can i push?
ok. oh god. (to ross) get the camera, it is in the diaper bag.
oh, oh ross, oh my god, are you okay?
ross, see! i told you, those swings are evil! alright, that is it. that is
ross, c'mon, please. can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets
(looks at him suspiciously) i know what this is all about... you have always been
alright fine. I will do it.
if you hold a spider.
if you hold a spider.
ok... i got a spider. there were two, i picked the bigger one.
ok... (and passes the spider to ross who holds it in between his hands)
(reluctantly) ok... of-k...
(more confident) ok...
whoo... ok... wow... ok... oh!
a-alright! i can do this.
that is because he is on your neck.
ross!
wait, you can not go away this weekend! it is emma's birthday!
we are having a party.
no, that day... that will not be her real birthday!
well, can not you just go to vermont the next day?
and i mean, you know, you guys... this is a big deal. i mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
you know pheebs, when i was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find  them all.
oh, good, good! we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we will give it to her when she is 18.
oh no, it is still nap time. but she will be up soon.
i said it is still nap time.
hey joey, will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on?
oh, she is still napping
look, i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this is not a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? emma will never have a first birthday again.
no really, she did not sleep well last night, so we can not wake her up.
oh! emma might like what?
what did you get her?
well, this sounds like fun! well, you know what? actually? people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
(to everybody) all right, let us get this party started, huh? joey and phoebe are going to perform a little something for us.
so, joey, what are you going to do for us?
oh, ok, which one?
(crying) wow! that was amazing!
oh, phoebe, I am sorry! phoebe has prepared something as well.
is that it?
ross, um, do not forget to get a shot of emma’s cake. it is in a box in the fridge.
oh, you are going to love this cake. i got it from a bakery in new jersey, corino’s.
well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they will copy it in icing!
yes! on a cake shaped like a bunny.
ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! oh my god! they put my baby’s face on a penis!
why you guys this is not funny, all right? if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself!
oh! believe you me! i am going to bring this cake back, i do not even want it in my home... (turns towards the cake and sees joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) joey, do not touch it!!
(speaking to the person on the phone again) yes, yes. i still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
(into the phone) no, there is not time to go to the bakery. we are just going to come home... everybody left? alright, well just tell emma we are going to be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) bye...
ooh! god! sorry!
emma's awake.
i can not believe this. this is her first birthday. she is awake. we are not even there. everybody left. we still have this stupid obscene cake.
oh, why do you even bother? i already ruined her first birthday... and do you know how important these early experiences are ross? very! according to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
(shakes her head) i guess... oh, i just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "happy birthday". then we would all go into... hey get out of the road you stupid student driver!!! (honks furiously, and ross looks at her in disbelief and rachel looks at him.) they have to learn!
what?
(she looks at the cake) oh my god! look what... you made it into a bunny. how did you do that?
well, I am very impressed.
i do not care that you left. I am just glad that you are here. thanks you guys!
what?
oh! emma, that is right! you are that many!
(angrily) no, no science camp!
oh!... oh and emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
oh yeah, nothing! these are happy tears! this is just what i wanted.
okay.
yeah.
okay. (they both look into the camera, and ross waves.) hi emma. well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
oh my god, who is it?! (phoebe rolls her eyes.)
for you. (chandler leaves.)
oh, thank you for doing that. i just can not deal with this just quite yet.
you said that she was, i just did not disagree with you.
oh yeah.
oh! (they smile and the picture is taken.) oh by the way?
james brolin?
ed begley jr. is not gay.
no.
no!
thank you.
ugh! look honey y’know what? i have not told him yet, so until i do i do not think i should tell anybody else.
phoebe!!
okay.
honey, stop it! i am not going to tell you until i tell him.
oh y’know what honey? let us not talk about that right now?
sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
yeah.
hey! y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they are supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
i do not know! maybe they have tools.
well, maybe that is, maybe that is really brave.
maybe she has not really thought it through that well.
(starting to cry) i do not know.
uh-hmm. I am just thinking about phoebe; poor knocked up phoebe.
oh yes! thank you very much! (she grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. she then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without monica noticing. it does not work.) oh that is-that is actually how the french drink it.
i do not know. i do not know how i feel. this is all happening so fast. i have to make all these decisions that i do not want to make. (takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) somebody just take this away from me!!
what?!
how many ways are there to do that?
all right, I will-I will take it again when i get home.
okay. thank you.
oh, you guys are so great.
wh—hey, i just gave you peeing on a stick.
how much longer?
30 seconds, okay.
oh i know. i know. (they hug.)
oh wait! y’know what? i can not, i can not look at it. i can not. somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
okay.
what?
oh. oh. well there you go. whew! (pause) that is—that is great—that is really great-great news. (pause) y’know ‘because the whole not being ready and kind of the financial aspects, all that. whew. wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (starts to cry.) god.
thanks. (crying) god this is so stupid! (pause) how could i be upset over something i never had? it is negative?
what?!
are you sure?
oh!
oh-oh, that is a risky little game!
yeah. I am going to have a baby. I am going to have a baby. I am going to have a baby! (they all hug.)
ah, it is still not the time.
pheebs, i would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch emma. (to ross:) which one of us should go to dinner?
um, mon, chandler�s not here.
okay, well that�s now the third sign that i should not leave emma.
well, let�s see. the first one is: i don�t want to. and, you know, i�m not going.
she is?
what about (?) monica.
ish. i just don�t think i can bear it.
uch.
oh-a.
you need to learn some new slang.
what � oh! (points inside)
i was just going to say that i left my keys.
no. uch.
alright, i can�t, i can�t wait that long. you have to do something�knock that door down!
what if she jumped out the bassinet?
oh my god, i left the water running.
ah, did i leave the stove on?
is the window open? because if there�s a window open, a bird could fly in there.
ubb.
boy, are you going to be sorry if that�s true.
och, god. (seeing emma) oh, thank god, you�re okay. i�m so sorry we left you. mom never going to leave you again. never ever ever again. uch.
oh no. i mean it. after what just happened, i�m never leaving her again.
we got locked out of the apartment, we �
n-it wasn�t easy, but it�s your birthday and i did what i got to do.
oh honey, this is for the best, thus i�m not distracted, worrying about emma, how she�s doing at home and i�m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
she spit up. judy! she spi�judy! look alive, judy! (they sit down) thank you.
oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. what should i ha-ave? what should i have?
yah, i�ll have the soup and the salmon.
y�guys ever heard the story about when rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
(lifts for a toast) okay, as everybody has ordered, i would like to start the celebration and make a toast � to phoebe. she dropped her sock.
n-no, emma dropped her sock.
ross, she still has not noticed that the baby�s sock is on the ground.
(to ross) could you please get her attention?
phoebe, hi, we�re so sorry. you�re totally right. we are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
what?
oh thank god, if phoebe�s going, can we please take emma home?
no mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. i want to do this.
oh! that would be sooo much fun!
let us do it! ross?
do you want to play football?
um, there was a geller cup?
wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
(knocking it down instead of catching it) that almost hit me in the face.
monica, I am your best friend.
ross!
you do not pick me! you are stuck with me!
(coming over to ross, who is just getting up) are you okay?
over here!
(proud of her self) i almost caught that one!
wait, what am i going to do?
wait, how long?
okay.
yeah, i know, go long. y'know, it is like all I am doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
can i see that for second.
now, does it really matter?
all right, so are we not having dinner at all?
i went really long.
i can not believe your trading me!!
are you going to let me play?
yeah!!! kill ‘um!!!
no! come on! do not make me go long. use me. they never cover me.
god, I am not lame, okay. i can do something. i can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
thank you! break!
I am so sorry! are you okay?
I am sorry, they were just all coming at me, and i did not know what to do.
(on the verge of tears) okay.
(in triumph) i got a touchdown! we did it!!
we should defiantly play football more often. maybe there is a like league we could join or something.
oh shoot! i work monday nights.
hey.
well, y’know i was thinking of moving the couch over here.
so that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
and your lap does not count! okay? come on help me move this.
no?
I am sorry, rosita? as in…
joey, it is just a chair! what is the big deal?
stevie the tv?
no! (joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) oh what does he know! come on rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (she tries pulling on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) you bitch!
joey, joey i am so sorry.
okay, come on—joey, I will buy you a new one! all right? we will go down to the store right now and we will-we will get you a new chair.
but do not you think rosita would have wanted you to move on? i mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.
(grabbing her coat) okay? you ready?
you will like it!
you do not even know!
well look, if you do not like this…(the audience’s laughter at chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of rachel’s line.)
come on joey, i just bought you a new chair! the most expensive one in the store! hey, y’know what i was thinking? we could name her francette.
joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. y’know, start the heeling process?
that is weird.
it is not a miracle joey! I am sure there is some explanation.
joey, i really do not…
well no.
no, y’know what? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! or something!
that is right joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (she sits down in the chair.)
(grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself!
hey, how is…how is the uh, miracle chair?
yeah? wow! y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
yeah! you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio!
hey chandler!
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment?
i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000. (which is an actual product by the way, I am not sure about the 3000 part.)
well, it is a long story, but umm i broke joey’s chair…
yeah.
ohhhhh. that is how it got fixed!
noo! (laughs) angels.
what? wh-hey!
yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
no joe, no miracle.
uh-huh! nice try, but you do not get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap! (joey starts to get up.) no i take that back!
no-no-no! this chair’s not going anywhere.
the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
we are the cobras!
ahhhh….
uh-huh.
hey!
oh yeah, joey broke it. had to get rid of it.
ohh, whoa god! storage rooms give me the creeps! monica, come on please hurry up honey! please?
i want the little round waffles.
okay, y'know what? I will-I will have toast!
arghhhh!!!!!!
you guys! you guys!
it was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! he was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
(proud of herself) yeah, i-i-i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass!
yeah!
please! we did not fog danny! who is danny?
hi! you might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
hi! just so you know, we-we did not mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
hi! sorry to bother you, but i do not think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just does not really seem like you mean it.
really! what is with that guy? i mean you would forgive me if i fogged you.
oh my god, honey, I am so sorry!
really?
oh my god! oh my god, look at these pelts!
what? uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, i know you are quirky and i get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! not nature, fashion!
hi!
what? yeti—i mean danny?
oh. listen, I am so sorry. i would, i would have never fogged you if y'know if you had not looked so…. y'know.
(shocked) what?
what? hey! no-no-no! this not cool! you do not even know me!
so from that you think you have got me all figured out? well, you do not! y'know i-i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with capri pants.
and stop saying that! i hate that!
fine! i judged you. i made a snap judgement. but you did it too! and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! you can not even open up your mind for a second to see if you are wrong! what does that say about you?
what?!
okay. okay.
(entering) hi!
oh, i went to have pizza. with danny.
that yeti is one smooth talker.
yeah, y'know i-i think I am just going to hang out in my room.
come on you guys! listen, if emily knew i was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. it is okay, i really… i do not mind.
ross, i…
okay. okay. joey, it is okay. settle down.
i have not seen him in so long!
ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
what? he said 'we should do it again', that is good, right?
since when?
and everybody knows this?
(carrying a tray of drinks) alright, do not tell me, do not tell me! (starts handing them out.) decaf cappucino for joey.. coffee black.. late.. and an iced tea. I am getting pretty good at this!
(leaving to serve others) good for me!
yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
chandler, what are you doing?
this alan again? how is it going?
well, then can we meet him?
what bank is this?
and did you notice...? (she spreads her thumb and index finger.)
what future boyfriends? nono, i th- i think this could be, y'know, it.
i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
well, no. that is impossible. you can never be too alan.
it is worse than the thumb!
well, i-i could live without it.
"indeed there is not"... i should really get back to work.
ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
(holding the phone out to chandler) chandler? it is alan, he wants to speak to you.
(to ross, who has wandered up) god, he is good.
yeah.
i think he is across the hall.
uh, joey..
we did not change..
(tearful) i just can not believe this! i mean, with the holidays coming up- i wanted him to meet my family-
remember when we went to central park and rented boats?.. that was fun.
hey! you remembered to put clothes on this morning.
oh, joey, it is so great to be back here. i got to tell you, you are making it so easy on me and emma.
well, I will probably be back to pick her up around six, but she is in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
bye!
hey!
you guys are not doing anything tonight, are you?
i was just asking because i need someone to watch emma tonight.
well, phoebe set me up on a date.
why? what is the big deal?
what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, I am all set.
so I will bring her by around seven? is that okay?
oh, you guys are going to have so much fun! she is at such a cute age. oh, a couple things. now that she is eating solid food, she poops around the clock. and watch out for your hair, because she likes to grab it. and oh, she is also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... thanks, you guys. have fun!
wow, everything looks so good! i think I am going to have the chicken.
oh, well, that is - that is very sweet. thank you.
what?
well, come on, steve; let us not rule out nervous laughter. hey, now wait a minute. phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. that is impressive.
really? what is that like?
really?
phoebe, it is me. I am going to hunt you down and kill you!
this is the worst date ever. how could you set me up with this creep?
i do not care! this guy is a nightmare!
he is not stoned.
yeah, four times.
no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry.
do not touch my coat!
oh, sorry, it is my phone. hello?
oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
no.
what? what do you mean, "there you are"? where was she?
well, uh...
really, really not.
all right, well that is good to know. good night, steve.
i just had a rough night.
eww!
oh, well, i...it is kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
yeah.
oh.
oh, oh no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
well, if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date had not shown up.
well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that did not even show.
thank you. (to monica) mon?
how is ross doing? y'know since all the emily stuff.
oh, honey, please, no, i can not get started with all that ross stuff again. i mean, he is going to screwed up for a looong time. and besides y'know, i do not, i do not go for guys right after they get divorced.
i do not know! he has not called me since that one time when we went out. i see him in the hallway, we flirt, I am all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
hi danny! (notices his box of liquor he is carrying.) wow! thirsty huh?
ohh, great!
yeah.
(laughs) okay. all right, i see what he is doing! he is not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
that is right! because that would give him the control! so now he is all ooh, coming up with this whole I have got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. blew up in his face, did not it?
no, there is a party. there is a party. but the power, that is still up for grabs. you follow me?
exactly.
oh, hi danny.
uh, actually, i think I am going to be busy.
yeah! remember i got that uh, gala.
it is a uh, regatta gala.
no-no, but i support it.
okay. (closes the door.) walked right into that one did not he?
yeah, but he waited until the last minute! so if i said yes, he would know i had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. i said, "no!" which puts me right back in the driver seat.
ball? there is no ball.
do not let him in! I am supposed to be at a regatta gala.
what? what kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
shoot, shoot, this is never going to work! he is right there!
no, i have to go downstairs and come back up as if I am coming home from the regatta gala. okay? so just go distract him. but do not be sexy.
hey! oh right, tonight was your party.
oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
yeah, sure. (to monica) all right, whose court is the ball in now?
oh, come on! he is glad that i came, he does not want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
oh, go on! you telling people about me?
(laughs) yeah, okay, at ease solider!
no, it is all right, you can just drop the act tommy. i know what is going on here. your danny's wingman right? you guys are best buds. frat bros!
yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. you tell him, "nice try."
man! he just keeps lobbing them up and i just keep knocking them right out of the park!
yeah!
yeah, i forget which ones.
(to julie) thank you. (under her breath to chandler) what a bitch.
(entering) hey, guys, what is up.
good, pheebs. what did you buy?
you went shopping for fur?
you bought boobs?
oh, this is so cute.
did you just say hi, jew?
phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
they took ben to the park. where have you been?
oh, no problem. you can borrow it, by the way. (puts her hand in the pocket) here are your keys, hon. (she takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and notices she also grabbed a receipt.)
mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
monica, what is with you? who would you have lunch with?
who?
what?!
you were with julie?
oh. oh my god.
yeah, right.  sure!
oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (waves the receipt)
oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
ok, monica. i just have to know one thing. did you go with her to bloomingdale's? (monica looks away.) oh! ok, ok, ok, i just really, uh, i just really need to not be with you right now. (exits.)
well that works out good, because I am not listening.
oh, I am sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
yes.
yes. monica, you do not get it. it is bad enough that she is stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with, but now, she is actually (starting to cry), but now she is actually stealing you.
i love you too. (they hug.)
(crying) I would do anything for you, you know that.
so. i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. i mean, you know, we have never really talked. i guess you would know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
really? me?
well, you are not totally paranoid.
um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I am not going to bore you with now, but um, i just, i see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god i hate it when she is right.
yeah, that would be great. I would love it.
all right, julie.
bye. (after julie exits.) what a manipulative bitch.
oh joey, I am so happy things worked out for us that we are having this baby together. i love you so much.
and i hope it is not an inappropriate time to say this but, you are the best sex i ever had.
(bursts into the room) joey! joey!
come feel this! come feel my belly!
joey! the baby is kicking for the first time! will you please come feel this?!
yes!
oh, okay! (she goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
aw, it is unbelievable! wow! she is kicking so much! oh, she is like umm…oh…who is that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
mia hamm!
(looking down) oh-oh!! one hand on the sheet joe!
it is not kicking right now. although we would love to see you do (mimics him) that again.
last night! i just felt it and i went into joey’s room and he was sleeping…
joey. joey, something feels weird and not good weird. i do not—whoa!! (winces in pain.)
really?
okay. oh god—ow!—oo!
hmm, mild discomfort. so i take it you have had one of these braxton thingies?
thank you doctor. (dr. long exits.) (to joey) oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
but wait you said everything was going to be okay.
but i—but everything is okay. I am fine!
yes! yes! i got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. mild discomfort, what is he talking about?
yeah, everything’s fine!
okay, no uterus, no opinion.
oh you went to the movies by yourself?
oh, i got to go back in there.
no, everything’s fine. i just got to go back…
i-i forgot my underwear. (ross let us her go.)
hey ross! check it out! i learned a new trick!
ohh! that is so sweet of you! oh yum! (takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) did you put pickles on this?
oh ross!! (runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
yeah, I will be fine. but could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when i get out there?
(entering) well, if anyone is keeping score, i no longer eat tuna.
what is up?
(gasps) are you breaking up with us?
yeah?
are you asking me to move out? do you not want me here?
but joey, i do not think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. i mean—(ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—or he does.
but ross, its you and me!
i do not know. is it crazy?
okay, let us do it. I will move in.
yeah.
wow.
noo, that is our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
good luck.
(jumping up from reading her magazine) yeah, right away mr. kaplan.
i know!
op.
oh, you got me.
oh, that sounds great.
oh thank you so much mr. kaplan, thank you so much.
oh god, i hate my job, i hate it, i hate my job, i hate it.
oh, i want to quit, but then i think i should stick it out, then i think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it is remotely related to the field they are interested in.
oh honey, come on, I am sorry, i did not.... i do not mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am i going to learn about fashion by walking mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
(to him) hi! is my misery amusing to you?
it is not funny, this is actually my job.
oh well then, so I am just going to go back to talking to my friend here. and you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
yes?!
(looks at monica) (to him) do you want my pickle?
(entering, to ross) the most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
hi! so I am out having lunch at monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. so i gave him my phone number and he is going to call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
i know!
uh-huh!
yeah! his name is um, mark something.
what!?
to be nice.
i did not have to, because i was wearing my ‘i heart ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.
well, i assume I will have to take showers with him, but y'know, that is true of any job.
i mean that is unbelievable.
dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
that is all right.
hey. (they all walk away from chandler)
did he call? did mark call?
oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) oh my god, is that phoebe?
music. very nice.
so, how are you?
oh yeah, what is it about?
yeah, i do. (they both run out)
i can not believe mark did not call. it is sunday night, and he did not call.
(to ross) yeah, right. look at you, you are practically giddy.
yeah, and you do not mind if i call, because you only want good things for me.
(on phone) hello, mark? hi, it is rachel green. (listens) oh no, do not you apologize. (listens) yeah, I will hold. (to monica and ross) he left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
(on phone) yeah, oh my god, tomorrow! that, no, it is perfect. oh god, thank you soo much. great! bye! (hangs up phone) i got the interview!
he even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
i got to figure out what I am going to wear.
yeah! right! okay, I will see you guys later. (starts to leave) woo hoo!
(getting of the elevator and noticing ross) hey!
what are you doing here?
oh.
hi.
oh well, the woman i interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank god mark coached me, because once i started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and would not shut up.
me too!
i know.
yeah.
yeah. (turns around) hi mark!
oh, i did!
(to ross) oh my god!! (she turns around and hugs mark, not ross)
eavesdropping. pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
honey, I am sorry.
hi!
i can not believe this! this is emma's first thanksgiving!
it is not? (whispering to ross) when was she born?
hi! happy thanksgiving!
did you at least win the contest?
can not wait!
yeah.
well, let us see... uh... i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. why?
oh my god! that is the creepiest thing I have ever heard!
oh! phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, i mean, you know, and judging who is cuter just for a trophy...
and a thousand dollars.
...is something I am very interested in! oh please, do not tell ross. he still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking ross) what is in the inside is important...
where am i going to get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving?
oh, take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch kid.
oh phoebe, listen. well, i think we got to go. this place is really freaking me out. I have been watching this guy over there, i do not think he came with a kid!
phoebe, i think... it is just too weird, i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
oh, phoebe! come on! you know what, it is already three of the clock and they have not even gotten to emma's group yet. we got to go, we got dinner!
phoebe, you have to calm down.
really?
you heard them say that?
all right, okay. alright, let us give to these babies something to cry about!
no, what?
no phoebe, i am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
because i already did!
no...
what are you doing here!
and i won!
yes! (spells it) y-e-s. yes!
yeah. that is me!
she won a thousand dollars!
well, i do not know, you guys figure it out, i got to put emma down for a nap.
alright, emma is napping... (then to ross) what happened to your shirt?
you know what, we just say that she said it was 5 of the clock. we will just act casual. we are not late, we are right on time. (when she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under monica's and chandler's door, into the hall. ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
oh, god. this is bad. this is so bad.
oh, hey, i have an idea. why do not we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and rachel has paper, phoebe and ross both have rock, while joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. they all look a him confused).
alright, enough, enough, come on. let us just all go in at the same time.
alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) alright, you guys. we are so sorry we are late. please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
you guys, come on, it does not matter why we are late. we are all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (a slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
(gasps) oh, i just remembered. we do have something to eat. monica put something in our oven this morning.
huh... oh my god it is brussels sprouts. (they all look appalled)
oh, i know... i still have my old key! (she goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) we can just unlock the door.
you know what? i do not want to be with them either, but it is thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (goes to unlock the door)
oh!
so bad.
dessert?
congratulatioooons!
ewww, is that what that is?
yeah! I will cook!
hey!
i lent them to ross.
I am so happy for you!
to monica and chandler... and that knocked up girl in ohio.
really?
hey, sophie!
thanks for lunch, chandler. y'know, you did not have to walk me all the way back up here.
honey um, honey, you do realise that we do not keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?
summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
(introduces them) joanna, this is my friend chandler bing (to chandler) joanna.
bye, chandler.
oh, nothing, he is just goofy like that, i actually, hardly notice it anymore.
no!! no! he is not married, or involved, with anyone!
well, I will ask him for you, if you want me too?
(entering) hey!
i need to talk to you!
oh, sorry. i meant chandler.
okay, my boss, joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
(looks at him) that was (pause) surreal. okay, what do think? are you interested at all?
oh thank you, chandler, this is so great, she is going to love me.
wow!!
what is this?
all right!
(to chandler) of-of-of-okay, how did it go? tell me everything.
hmm.
what?!
oh, i....
oh, i know...
ohh, gee. i wonder why she thinks you are going to call her?
you can not just say, ‘nice to meet you, good night?’
well, they always called.
no. sorry.
okay, okay. umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
well...
no. i...
(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) call her! call her now!
why has not he called rachel? why? why? i do not understand. why? he said he will call. why? why? chandler I am telling you she has flipped out, she is gone crazy!
come on, this is not funny. she thinks it is my fault that you have not called her. you have to call her!
well then you are going to have to take her out again.
i do not care! i do not care! you are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it is actually ended. and, i do not care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
that is fine!
i know.
sophie’s desk.
(whispering) chandler!! are you going to call her!
chandler!!
okay, you are going to tell her and you are going to tell her now. (she grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
hey, mon, if you were hoping to sleep with joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (she is holding two frilly, lace nighties.)
sorry. I am so exited! I have been waiting for this for months! i got my hair coloured! i got new sheets! I am making him a very fancy meal.
what am i making him by the way?
i thought i was making him filet mignon?
wow, i really get crabby when i cook.
ohh, please! cooking soothes me. (they kiss.) ahh. so, dig in!
(taking a bite) hmmm!
oh i know, my god, this is so—this rice is so—i am so good.
(sees the chick and the duck) oh, yeah, I am sorry. they used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
yeah, sure, okay. okay.
all gone! so, farm birds, huh?
oh.
okay. so, can i serve you a little of—what? what? what? (she sees that joshua is not relaxed.)
but, they are across the hall! i mean that is two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? i mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.
your parents’?
ohh.
yeah that works.
wow! this place is fabulous!
whoa-whoa, there is two living rooms? god, growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. want to make out?
that sounds like a plan. umm, is there a place i can go freshen up?
ah.
hi you!
i know, i can do more than cook.
ohh! it is so nice to meet you. (she goes over and shakes their hands.) hello.
hello.
what? this-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that is-that is not what it is. see, see, okay, i work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. it is-it is, they are-they are wearing it in milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then i see how people respond, and then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdale’s, so… and obviously in uh, in-in this case, (she grabs a pen and paper) i am going to report back, "usa not ready."
yes!
well, we were going to do that after—i mean umm, next.
oh, yeah, well… yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.
yes.
oh, yeah. and uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, i jumped up, and my boob popped out.
no, it is all right. i got nice boobs. (phoebe and monica nod there heads in agreement.)
so?
huh.
she is totally right! when we were together, you got all freaked out about mark and there was nothing going on.
absolutely! absolutely!
what—yeah—what, y’know what? i hope emily is a lesbian.
honey, you can say it, poconos, poconos, it is like poc-of-nos (touching paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
i know...
i mean, we are way past the fling thing, i mean, i am feeling things that I have only read about in danielle steele books, you know? i mean, when I am with him, I am totally, totally...
(to ross) i can not believe you do not want to know. i mean, i could not not know, i mean, if, if the doctor knows, and carol knows, and susan knows....
pheebs!
oh, right, that is me!
"ooo," what?
hi pheebs!
no, these are not all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to phoebe) this one's paolo's.
well, sure...just a sec, though, because paolo's on his way over.
oh, pheebs, pheebs...
(taking cookie) ok, thanks pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) oh my god, why have i never tasted these before?!
all right, well, you are right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.
i guess you do not.
i need some milk.
no...oh, i feel so stupid! oh, i think about the other day with you guys and i was all "oh, paolo, he is so great, he makes me feel so..." oh, god, I am so embarrassed!
pheebs, if i had never met him this never would have happened!
i do not know...right, he is the pig!
oh, god, he is such a pig,
he is like a big disgusting...
...pig...pig man!
(voice wavers) oh, but he was my pig man...how did i not see this?
ok, ok, pheebs...
oh, god...
no, no, trust, me, it is, it is, it is much better that i know. uh, i just liked it better before it was better...
hey.
ooh, I have been better...
oh, ross...
i am so sick of guys. i do not want to look at another guy, i do not want to think about another guy, i do not even want to be near another guy. (ross crosses arms)
oh ross, you are so great!
oh...
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
no. i just need to be by myself for a while, you know? i just got to figure out what i want
no, i know, i know, and I am sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
what?
uh...no. no, no, in fact, you are not having a boy.
joey? are you in there?
hey!
is joey here?
well, at least you make each other laugh.
well, i have not seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… i do not know, i think he is avoiding me. why is that bagel on the floor?
ew, was chandler naked? sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
all right. well listen, if you see joey will you just tell him uh…tell him i miss him. (exits and joey enters.)
okay, I am done. do mine.
ah.
well, i have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
well just ask mona to give it back!
hi!
hi.
so i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out, but it is not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
how do you know that? what if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can not even be in the same room with each other?!
oh my god!! you guys have such problems!! i feel so terrible for you!
oh yeah. that makes sense.
ooh, i can do that.
hi.
what?
yeah it is umm… yeah it is uh… it-it is y’know—it is nothing.
yeah—no wait! joey no wait it is. it is something. it is-it is umm…it is my boss.
yeah, and umm my baby.
my boss wants to buy my baby!
i know i told you, it is a really big problem.
can you believe that?!
that is what i told him!
well I will tell ya! (pause) see uh my-my boss and his wife—they-they can not have children. so umm, and that—we were at the christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "rachel, i want to buy your baby."
ohh! yeah! (pause) yeah that-that would have been a much simpler problem.
(entering) hey! great advice on that joey thing!
oh it was perfect! i mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
oh that is not important. the point is, i really—i think everything’s going to be okay.
hey! oh joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. that really meant a lot.
(worried) what?
whoa-whoa-whoa, let us say more!
what?!
no! no, no-no-no joey he does not want to buy my baby! i made that up!
so that we would have something to talk about! so it would not be awkward!
(to joey) i can not believe that you yelled at my boss! I am-I am going to lose my job! what am i going to do?!
oh joey, i can not believe you brought my boss into this! I am going to get fired!
well, she told me too! (points to monica and joey glares at her.)
morning. you wanted to see me?
okay look mr. zelner…
yeah. (motions for him to continue.)
oh god.
well, as long as we are clear about that. (exits smugly.)
hi.
it is all going to be okay. they are just so happy that I am not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. so long as i understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child i should bear.
chandler, can you give us a minute?
yeah.
joey, I am really sorry that i lied to you. i was just trying to make things…
it kind of worked. i mean y’know, i do not know about you buy i have not thought about our thing since all this.
yeah i know! i miss that.
my gynecologist tried to kill me.
well, I am really sick of your smoking, so i brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
come on, it is a hypnosis tape. this woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she has not smoked since.
(to ross) what is your problem?
ross, i watched you get hypnotised in atlantic city.
oh right, ‘because you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
oh, y'know what, i did not want cinnamon on this.
oh my god!! great!
well, that should not be a problem. i mean i work in fashion and all i meet are eligible straight men.
(laughs) well, i mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? i mean that are not a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what i mean. that wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
i think you should definitely go out with this guy.
monica, last saturday night, what happened on walker: texas ranger?
all right.
hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
yeah?
thank you.
hey mon, let us give pete a chance come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
we use it!!
oh my god, monica’s going to go out with a millionaire.
oh my god, i can not believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
oh yeah, sure, that too.
oh my god! the millionaire’s here!
hi!!
just one drink?!
hey! how was basketball?
oh, no! who did that?
she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let her sleep with him. that is all right? is not it?
joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him!
all right... oh, emma loves him!
(threatening joey with a scrunchy): step away from the crib, i have a weapon!
what are you doing?
oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that I am up I am going to go to the bathroom.
joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
oh that is so great, now emma has two hugsy's.
oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail...
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can not find it?
oh, i do not think she likes the new hugsy.
yeah, i think she wants the old one back.
joey, come on!
I am trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy?
original.
then what is that big lump under your covers?
that is not monica!
(to herself) oh god.
(yelling) joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much (joey covers hugsy's ears) oh do not cover its ears! (stops yelling) it is because it reminds her of her uncle joey!
yeah! and she is comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much.
oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, do not worry. emma will totally understand. i will not... but whatever (she leaves the room).
oooh... you are sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up. (turns to face emma in the the playpen) look emma, look who is baaack!
are you going to... you are going to take hugsy away from a little child?
hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! i hate being alone this time of year! next thing you know it will be valentine’s day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they are lighting that damn tree again. ohh, i want somebody! (hearing this, gunther moves in) y’know, i want a man!! (gunther leaves depressed) i mean, it does not even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.
well, believe me, it is been a long time since I have been flung.
yeah! wait a minute, it is been a long time that I have been single. how come you never offered this before?
okay! no accountants. oh, and no one from like legal. i do not like guys with boring jobs.
hey, honey! what is the matter? (monica shows her, her hat.) fine, i was just trying to be nice! whoa!
well, wait a minute, you are the boss! why do not you just yell at them? or, fire them?
pheebs, that is great!
but y’know umm, rachel does not rhyme with draddle.
oh yeah!
really?!
so, will i like any of these guys?
chandler!
ohh, i like swimmer’s bodies!
op, i like credit cards!
well, so what does he do?
your company has a fine foods division?
(entering) chandler!! you have the best taste in men!
patrick and i had such a great time last night! i mean i think this could maybe turn into something serious.
well, y'know, possibly. (pause) you did not tell him that, though? right?
you told this guy that i was looking for a fling?! you do not tell the guy that!
oh, between you telling him that i wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he is so going to get the wrong idea.
chandler! patrick just uh, ended things with me. did you or did you not tell him that i was looking for a serious relationship?
you idiot!!
you do not tell a guy that you are looking for a serious relationship! you do not tell the guy that! now you scared him away!
y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
oh! see just I am right back where i started! aww, this sucks! being alone, sucks! (she sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
really?
no.
cute guys in little shorts? sure.
well that sounds fun too. (they hug.)
what?! chandler, what is the matter with you?!
so, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
and?
look at that!
what?!
no-no, i bought those.
yeah. (rachel walks away.)
well, who would not?!
and mrs.?!
what?!!
ohh! oh god! (laughs her way into the living room.)
yeah honey you do not believe her do you?
ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
some uh, some visual aides.
hey pheebs, you are still alive! how are you doing?
pheebs, what-what are you doing?
oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. i thought we would lost you forever. pheebs, you lie down?
monica!
did-did you take these back?
oh yeah, they are really great! are not they?
yeah. (monica walks away) nice try! (rachel puts them in a box.)
hey!
wow, that is great ross, I am sorry we were not more supportive before.
well, we are a little early, the lecture does not end for 15 minutes.
yeah, we could. oh hey look! there is some kappa kappa deltas! i was a kappa. (to them) hey sisters! (they ignore her.) (to monica) wow, we really are bitches.
yeah, and not a very good one.
(in an indian accent) yes, yes, bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
no! they are mine!
you stole them from me!!
yeah that seems fair. we never use them.
well…
yeah, i mean, come on ross, no one will even notice. i mean they are probably not even listening!
of course they are listening to you! everybody listens to you.
really? really?!
okay! (picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (in an irish accent) "hello ross, this is dr. mcneeley from the fake accent university, we would like you to come on board with us full time! (hangs up.)
hey!

oh, I am sorry.

i do not know. it is so complicated. i work with this guy, you know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i do not

and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,
hi. can emma and i live here for a while?
thank you.
i do not want to stand in the way of true love or anything, but i think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
woow!i have not seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were going to be with a real talking dog!
(excited) are you serious?
hey, that was an honest mistake!
yeah, that was an awesome day!
hey joey, is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity?
oh, please!honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I am...oh my god!is that christian sanders?he is so gorgeous!

oh, I am sorry, you are right.I am sorry, good luck! (they hug)
(watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) oh!
ssshhhhttt!!he is asking her a question!!

(waking up) ehhh, aw! (pause). well, that is new!
can i ask you a question?
have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey.
oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense.
i do not know! i mean, maybe that is something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday.
olivia.
so do you think that my dream means anything?
ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream...
you took the same class twice.
hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
ok, we are still on that.
hey!
joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
(looks puzzled) how...how...?
uh-huh
(to herself) wow...definitely just drake...
what...how is it going with drake?
what...that scene i saw was so good!
joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you are bad so I will give you a compliment?
so?
ooh! honey, it can not be that hard, i mean, you have been in love before?
ok...this could be a little awkward...I am just going to blow past it... well can not you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
(shakes her head) alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you are playing the scene.
(looks touched) joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
who are you saying "check" too?
have fun!
oh, i know.
what?!
yeah, well, i got to work, I am sorry.
because, i can not! ross, i told you, no. i can not.
oh, honey! do not get up! what do you need?
come on! i am here to take care of you! what do you need? anything.
okay, that is all you.
oh, i do not know. i guess we have to eat.
I am just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i should not have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me.
(interrupting) still in love with?!
I am not in love with ross!
phoebe, I am going to ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. not because, I am still in love with him! i mean, hey, y’know, i like ross as much as the next guy, y’know? clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings do not mean love! i mean, i still have loving feelings for ross. yeah! but, i have, i have continuing feelings of love, but that does not mean that-that I am still in love with him. y’know? i-i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love him—ohh! oh my god! oh my—why did not you tell me?!!
we?!
you all know? does ross know?
oh, i can not believe you did not tell me!
(depressed) hi.
manhattan does not have enough stores.
you can?
um-hmm.
okay.
ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out.
i do not know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
okay.
all right.
okay.
ow!
well, i like you less!
pheebs?
do you remember where the duck food is?
(enters with a bag packed) because I am going to london.
yeah, i have to tell ross that i love him. now honey, you take care, you do not have those babies until i get back. (kisses her stomach.)
yeah, i know, i know, i know he does. but i have to tell him how i feel! he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
ohh—do you think he will?!
y’know what? no. it is not over until someone says, "i do." (exits)
(running to the ticket counter) ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. (slightly out of breath) hi.
(faking cheerfulness.) hello. umm, when is your next flight to london?
ohh, good.
ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
(looking through her wallet.) ohh, i just do not think i have enough left on my credit card.
ohh, okay, how about five. (she hands her all the credit cards.) ohh, thank you.
(looking through her purse.) okay, you know what? i do not have it, but i can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. but you know what? i have my drivers license and i have a twenty. (she slides it across the counter.)
(running to her room.) hi, pheebs.
(running back out the door with her passport.) bye, pheebs.
hi, I am back. listen, i need to...
hello. i need to get on the 11 of the clock flight.
okay, you know what/ you are going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.

look, if i do not get to london!! he is going to marry that other girl!!!
all right, you know what? i am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (she pounds her hand on the counter twice. the ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)
ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.)
yeah?
oh. I am sorry. I am very sorry. sorry. (she hums and sighs happily.) it is just, I am ahh, I am kind of excited. I am, ahh, going to london to ahh, tell this guy that i love him and... (he puts his headphones on to ignore her.)
...and so then i realized. all this stuff i had been doing. proposing to joshua, lying to ross about why i could not come to the wedding. was all just a way of...
ehh, pardon me?
but he has to know how i feel!
(sighing) well i-i think your wrong.
well i just came...(she touches him near his heart. she is almost in tears.) i just needed to tell you...(looking into his eyes. she takes a deep breath.) congratulations. (he hugs her. she can barely hold back the tears.)
monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
oh no, not in my room! I will get him.
(out of shot) stop it! marcel! bad monkey!
let us just say my curious george doll is no longer curious.
oh, monica. you are not still going over that thing.

what does she mean?
she could be you.

nope. we took her to lunch.
no way. no way did you do this.

monica? monica!

okay monica, what are you doing? you are going to lose your job! this is not you!
hello? yes, she is, hold on a second, please. monana, it is for you, the credit card people.
what?
(brings marcel a teddy bear) marcel, this is for you. it is, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
oh, he is precious! where did you get him?
hey, do you guys know what you are doing for new year's? (they all protest and hit her with cushions) gee, what?! what is wrong with new year's?
well, for your information, paolo is going to be in rome this new year, so I will be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
phoebe, you are on.
(into microphone) okay, hi. ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, miss phoebe buffay. wooh!
pheebs, i can not believe he has not kissed you yet. i mean god, by my sixth date with paolo, i mean he had already named both my breasts! ...ooh. did i just share too much?
yeah!
(brings joey a mug of coffee) okay, here we go...
(glances at joey and then sips his coffee) there. now there is.
five.
sorry. paolo's catching an earlier flight.
oh, c'mon. we will have, we will have a big party, and no-one'll know who is with who.
rome. jerk missed his flight.
no. okay. i was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. something about how it was her cab first. and then the next thing i know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! so I am blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I am going to get into a cab she tackles me. and i hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (to monica) are people eating my dip?
vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
the bll is drrbing!
i can not kiss anyone.
...i think that bitch cracked my tooth.
that is nice.
well that was umm…okay.
ohh no you do not! you got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
what are you going to do pheebs?
(entering, excitedly) oh! hi you guys, oh my god! you will never going to believe happened to me today! i am sitting in my office and…
joey! kind of in the middle of a story here!
okay, so anyway I am sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.
joey!
yeah! guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (to monica and phoebe) it was ralph lauren! (monica and phoebe gasp) ralph lauren walked into my office!
it is the same story.
(ignoring him) anyway, ralph just came in to tell me that he is so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
yeah!
i got—i get a big pay raise!
i get to hire my own assistant!
(reading the resume) and you were at this job for four years?

chandler, you have an assistant right?

i love him. he is so pretty i want to cry! i do not know what to do. tell me what to do.
uh-huh. no, i hear what you are saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can i just say one more thing? (takes out his picture.) look how pretty!

all right i know, i know how it looks pheebs, but I am telling you…

(noticing him) hi! (puts the pictures away.)
well yeah, sure, what is up?
oh really?!
oh, did you not want people to know that?
why is that?
ohh, you can say. come on, i do not want you to feel like you can not tell me things. (motions for him to sit down.)
‘kay.
yeah.
(pause) yeah, she is gay.
(while entering) hi you guys.
ooh, italian! (she also grabs a plate)
hey you guys... you are never going to believe it. this headhunter called me. i have a meeting tomorrow with gucci. gucci wants me.
congratulations!
ooh! (they hug)
(to maitre d') hi, I am here to see mr campbell... with gucci. the reservation is probably under gucci. it is spelled like gukki, which could be confusing.
oh my god! that is my boss. you have to seat us somewhere else.
but my... but my boss cannot see me. I am interviewing for another job.
sssshhhh!
hi... I am on a date...
yeah, it is. yeah, you know, it is tough. single mom, career... you got to get out there.
oh.
yes, hi!
hi! (to mr zellner) excuse us.
okay. oh, yeah... (whispering to mr zellner) oh he is cute!
wha... my resumé? i would not... i would not call my online dating profile a resumé.
(starts singing la la la la) whatever happened to just singing for no reason? huh?
what? i-i do not.
no, i-i-i love it there.
oh! it is not good.
well, i did not get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren.
well, my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview and he heard everything. so later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he is going to have to let me go, because I am not a team player. and i said "wait a minute! yes i am." and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
oh it... good! yeah, but I am not going to hear from that for a couple of days.
ah, all right. here is to ross!
(crying) no, it is not that. i got fired today. and i did not get the other job.
oh!
no, it is okay, you did not know.
oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
(is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) well, now i do not have to. (the man leaves instantly)
(annoyed) ross, what is taking you so long?
(turns around) mark? oh my god! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
I am fantastic. you remember ross?
oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you are not catching me on my best day.
no, but it is good, you know, I am going to take some time off and do some charity work.
well, screw charity work. what have you got?
great! I will call ya!
(very excited) oh my god!
ross! that is mark. from bloomingdales? you were insanely jealous of him.
yes.
oh.
what? you do not want me to get a job?
ugh.
ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) okay, let us talk about it later, there comes security. (takes her box and leaves. ross follows her and then returns for the chair. he stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)
(entering) hi you guys!
oh, it was great. mark is so sweet.
oh ross, come on. he is happily married. his wife just had twins.
he offered me one.
i know, it is amazing. it is amazing. it is so much better than what i had at ralph lauren. the money is great...
the job is in paris. (they all stare at each other)
nooo way! the most romantic song ever is the way we were.
what song was that, pheebs?
hey mon!
no, it is been three nights in a row.
what?!
monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
well, you know I am not surprised. i mean have you seen them together, they are really cute.
yes, joey, i remember, she is annoying, but you know what she is-she is his girlfriend now. i mean what can we do?
(she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) honey, i was wondering....
do you still have that, um, navy uniform?
hmm.
you remember not having sex in high school, right?
well honey, what about you?
i mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
come on you got to have one!
ross, you know what...
...if you tell me, i might do it.
yeah.
oooh!
really!
did you ever do the-the leia thing?
really! that-that great huh?
hi you guys!
mon. hi!
why are not you at work?
why?
you really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
hi.
what?
oh, really, let me see, let me see.
ross, i did not think it would that big of a deal.
okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
okay, ross, phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. you know, i mean, come on, guys do the same thing, i mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
were both of those joey?
not even with your best friend.
that is so sad. your missing out on so much, ross. i mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. and-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
pretty much.
uh, honey, yeah that was with carol.
okay, here we go. I am jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. what? honey, what is it? did i get it wrong? did i get the hair wrong? what? did you just picture it differently? what? what?
ohh, are you setting ross up with someone? does she have a wedding dress?
hey.
yeah.
well, sure, but they might think it is kind of weird considering i do not work there anymore.
i-i, got a job at ralph lauren.
yeah. (chuckling) a year ago..
but, pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where i actually work. but, just come by at lunch so my boss does not see you. because kim will just freak out and she already does not like me very much.
sure.
oh my god. did you talk to him?
what? what!?! you kissed him?
(gasps) phoebe are you serious?
phoebe, i mean, you do know he is married?
phoebe…
oh, kim, hi. (kim does not even look up from her report.)
so you know, i…i handed in that marketing report and i never got to hear what you thought.
ahh….so…wow…the spring line, it is really going to be great this year, huh?
so i hear the ralph lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. (kim stops the elevator and turns to rachel.)
yeah. your teeth? yes, i saw them from outside. (sitting down on the couch.) you guys are never going to believe this. but, phoebe made out with ralph lauren.
yeah i know. she ran into him at my office and they just…made out. and the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because i told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she would heard all year.
that-that is your make out buddy. do not you recognize him? (holding up the magazine in front of her face.) oh wait. ohh, phoebe i love you. kiss me please.
what?
oh my god, phoebe, that is not ralph lauren. that is kenny the copy guy.
oh..go..oh..and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren. if she finds out that i lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. phoebe!!
to get you to make out with him!!!
ohh, hi, kim.
yeah, remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday? well it did not happen.
okay, two things did not happen. remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room? well, it turns out that is not true.
no.
oh no, no, no. oh god, you think i made out with him.
i-i do not want your job. i-i do not. ohh this is such a mistake. i did not make out with him. nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday. i do not even know how to use my keycard. (the elevator stops. ralph steps on.)
now, she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job.
i did but she does not think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren.
you were with kenny today, were not you?
ohh, phoebe, what am i going to do?
I am not going to sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i would not.
that would not help me.
kim, hi.
okay..okay.. look. I am sorry that i lied to you before. you were right. ralph and i were an item but were not anymore.
(faking crying.) yeah, he dumped me. he said, "rachel, i can not do this. even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. i can not do this. I am married and I am sorry." and then i do not know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. especially not above kim, who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine."
of course it is true and it hurts so bad.
you and ralph?
(speaking to herself and reading cosmopolitan) oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show!
oh... oh, I am sorry! I am not... i was just-i was just reading to emma.
yeah, yeah... it is... "climax your way to better skin".
(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
yeah...
oh, well...
ok, uh-uh... let us-let us shop!!
which you are not, because you have totally hung up on him!
and you are going to want him to eat his heart out so you are going to have to look fabulous!
hey pheebs, I am-I am taking charlie shopping, why do not you come and I will help you find something.
that is not what we are going to do!
hi! ok, you are ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?
not going to find any clothes in there!
hi.
oh... you are not going to do a magic trick, are ya?
I am there!
bye, see ya. (she goes)
pheebs, that is for men!
on melanie griffith in "working girl". i think what you want is over here.
really?
oh, i can not. because i-I have seen them.
yeah! I am a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies!
sure!
you know that depends on what it is! I have done a lot of stuff.
she is ok, i just do not get a really good vibe from her!
i do not know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance!
anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom...
shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him.
it is just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it is just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous!
(annoyed) oh, i get it!
i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal.
so can we keep this between us?
ok, great, because i got to get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard!
ok, great!
oh, thank god i can not hear a word that you are saying!
(sticks her head out too) well, get back in there and talk!
(comes out again) what!?
ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too!
oh! what are we going to do?
oh my god!
(yelling at the stranger) alright! enough out of you!
alright! let us just do it. let us just go over there and see if she heard.
ok. (phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. rachel sees and follows her) wha...? where? where are you going?
(to charlie) hey, hi! hey, where have you been?
(pretends to be stunned) oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that is so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it is just such a small world!
oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain.
(after a pause) yeah.
yeah! that is phoebe. that is phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it is like she is a nympho!
yeah...
(looks ashamed) i try...
no, that is david.
(disapprovingly) tip of the iceberg.
good! ‘because I have got a product report to read, it is like eight pages, i hope i do not fall asleep.
(sees chip’s phone number) wow! look at that, chip matthews called. i wonder what he wants?
(interrupting) i bet he sensed that i was ready to have sex with another guy.
okay. (picks up phone) are you sure you want to hear this?
(on phone) chip! hi, it is rachel. (listens) rachel green. yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) monica geller. (listens) ohh.
why? i love that thing.
something to do with numbers?
what?
you mean the mom you met in montauk. she was a cat?!
umm, when were you going to tell me that you are going out with chip matthews?
nooo! it is not okay! i can not believe you would want to after what he did to me!
monica! i could not find him for two hours! he was having sex with amy welch!
i mean why, of all people would you want to go out with chip?!
okay, that does not help me, because we went to the same high school.
(shocked) they had to have that specially made?!
(stunned) oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot!
oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)
yeah. just, if it is possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
i believe it.
yes, i do.
oh sure i am, because you always have to be right.
jurassic park could happen.
(entering) you guys, you are never going to believe what i just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (she is holding a flyer.) look kind of familiar?
you guys, there is a little girl in soho looking for this cat. i mean, you know what that means?!
do we have to tell her?
i hate when ross is right!
pheebs...
all right!!
jeez!
hello, chip.
I am great! I am great. I have got a great job at bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I am not seeing anyone right now, I have never felt better about myself.
she will be out in a second. so, chip, how is umm, amy welch?
wow! they really got you guys. your t.v. the chairs.
(to monica) so, how was your date?
um-hmm.
oh honey, I am sorry.
ohh! that is so great!
I am sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)
you could.... say you are sorry to her mom.
so honey, what are you going to do about the little girl?
I will go with you.
oh god, that is right. i blocked that out.
oh, d'you like it?
what?
pheebs, i... there is not going to be any flying about! we actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
seriously pheebs, it is not going to be that kind of a party.
nooo! phoebe, of course there is more! i mean, I will just go and talk to monica and get an eta on the pee-pee's!
well, he is coming from jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
(pretends to be shocked) uh! the police!
yeah?
all right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
no, that is ok, let us me just get my check book!
this is so awesome! college guys are so cute!
i know. but if some guy who looks like corey haim wants to kiss me tonight, I am sooo going to let them! (they spot chandler)
it... you can so totally tell.
well let us see. maybe he knows where ross is. (they walk towards chandler) hey, how is it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
yeah, rachel. and this (points to monica) is ross' sister, monica. we met at thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
bitchin'
oh.
i am sooo drunk.
(finishing the last of her drink) i am soo not going to do good on my sats tomorrow.
(sarcastic) oh yeah. there is a plan! why do not i just start taking my smart pills now?
(blushing) oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards chandler and whispers "oh my god!")
oh well, you know, i think it is kind of really important that i go somewhere where there is sun, so I am sort of... (chandler leans in an kisses her) (she pulls away) hey!
(she considers it for a second) yeah okay. (she puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
no, wait. no there is got to be something else that you can do. i mean, what skills do you have?
so maybe something in an office.
(to phoebe) really?
ow ow ow. ow ow ow ow. ow ow ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
ow ow ow. ow ow ow. ow ow ow.

oh, yeah, check it. definitely, i want some of that.
why, how much is this going to cost?
wel-wel-well what are we going to do?
(like a big baby) um... unless, unless i use yours.
(tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did i just put as my "in case of emergency" person?
well, alright, then, forget it. (getting up to go) might as well just go home. ow ow ow ow!
thank you. thank you. i love you.
are not you a little cute to be a doctor?
i meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, i meant young, young to be a doctor. oh good, rach.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
not stupid. the very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and i said "yes."
what? monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
was that the cake?
i hope it is okay.
(entering from her room) okay, coming!
hi.
oh, that is great. look at that.
okay, listen, I am thinking, why do not we just tell them who we really are? i mean, it will be fine, i really think it will be fine.
oh, monica! would you stop being such a wuss?
(resenting the truth) i am not a baby! you know what? i swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
you know what?
you know what?
you know what?
every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
hello! here we go!
(as monica) thanks! I have been here about six years, and rachel moved in a few months ago.
(as monica) aahh, I am a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
(as monica) yeah it is, mostly because i get to boss people around, which i just love to do.
(as monica) and by the way, have i mentioned that back in high school, i was a cow?
(as monica) i use my breasts to get other people's attention.
would you excuse me for a second?
(on phone) daddy... daddy... daddy, why whyyy would i sleep with billy dreskin? his father tried to put you out of business! (rachel turns to monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so dr.green can not hear, while mouthing "you are...") ...dead!
hello? (listens) um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at ross who takes the remote from marcel, then turns off the tv) okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she is here.
it is the woman from the hospital admissions office. she says there is a problem with the form. oh, god, oh god...
okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.
what?
ohhh... (slumping in relief) okay, you were right. you were right! this was just not worth it.
okay, let me just change.
(as monica) hi, remember us?
(as monica) yeah, and and, I am just going to pay for this with a check.
(as monica) yeah, i know... (mirroring her friend) ..I am I am just not that bright either.
oh.
what?
(as monica) oh.
(as monica) hi.
�mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est� haciendo el hula hoop! (look, look, ugly naked guy is doing the hula!)
(to joey) hey, who is phoebe with?
do you think I am someone else?
well, believe it or not, it is true. when joey and i were together, he was wonderful. he was thoughtful and mature. and for the one week that we went out, he did not sleep with anybody else!
hi!
oh!
well, it is a little low... pick up a little... (ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) there you go! (pause) now throw it away!
ross, please, trust me. i buy 30 fashion magazines a month. now, i do not know who is running for president or who that... nato guy is, but i do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
hi
what?
oh! oh, no!
oh, yeah. joey does not share food. i mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
oh no! not me! emma!
ah, this place is great!
ross, look, i know that some of this stuff is out there, but i mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). i mean, this is just beautiful!
yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
no, no, no, no! ross, wait! come on! you know, there is other stuff. here is a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
yes, they will! you know what you should do? just go take a walk, all right? i know your size and I am... I am going to pick up some really good stuff for you.
yes! and i know what looks sexy on guys. please, just wear what i suggest, and she is going to go nuts for you.
(to phoebe) why do men keep talking to me like this?
we got some really great stuff!
oh! really? do you want to try some of them on for me?
(looking into one of her shopping bags) oh no! i took one of ross' bags by
(entering) hey, you guys…
is monica here?
all right listen umm, i just bought something I am not sure she is going to like it, and it is going to seem a little crazy, but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl.
noo! i wish! okay, you ready?
okay! (she goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, ross stares in shock.) check it out!
it is a, it is a cat!
yes it is!
excuse me! but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat!
well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal.
a thousand bucks.
all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
ugh! look you guys, I am really excited about this! okay? i do not care what you think! I am going to go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson. (they both glare at her.) well, what am i going to call her? fluffy?!
hey.
oh, wow! congratulations, that is quite a waste of time.
yeah?
well, it is my cat.
oh yeah, i got a cat.
you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. i mean, it is not sweet, it is not cute, i even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. and i swear, i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me i know it is saying, "rachel!"
well, i was going to let you play with it.
(she is wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) i give up you guys, i do not know what I am going to do with this thing!
i tried! they will not take her back.
well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
no mon that is not the point. I am out a thousand dollars, I am all scratched up, and I am stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (storms out.)
show cat! quality show cat! show cat! (a woman approaches.)
it is not a baby! it is a cat!
oh no! no! it is actually—it is very sweet. it is very sweet. look! (goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) yeah, do you want it?
well, so then what are you doing to me? okay? just get out of here! all right? move on!
yes! thank you! exactly! you want it?
oh, terrific! that will be $2,000.
okay, a thousand.
well, i do, but you are just going to have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) obviously you know how to haggle, so I am not going to try and take you on. okay? so $800 and i do not call the cops because you are robbing me blind! blind! (covers her eyes) just take cat, leave the money, and run away! run away! (uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) damnit! (to the cat) cat, can not you at least smile or something?! (the cat hisses at her again, it sounds like rachel) okay, did anybody just hear that? anybody?
it is not! I am defrosting a chicken. (pause) oh, i uh sold mrs. whiskerson.
yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
oh yeah, there you go. (hands over the pillow.)
oh good, great! I will-I will keep that in mind. (turns and walks away.)
phoebe! it is 6 of the clock in the morning! why are not you at gary's?
phoebe, are you okay?
phoebe, honey, want to get some breakfast?
yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
no, i meant with the dropper over here. (points at chandler.)
hey!
ohh, thank god! finally!
ohh, it is me and la poo! wow! i miss that dog.
great! thanks!
okay.
oops. sorry! well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
ohhhh. honey, honey, honey, it is okay, it is okay honey. I am going to fix you a drink, huh? maybe a margarita?
no honey, it is okay! listen, I will got to ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
okay, you want me to stop at the atm?
what?!
ohh please do not be from a real dinosaur! please! please! please! please! please! please! please! please! (she picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) made in mexico! yes!! ugh, who would buy this?! (looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)
hey! what is up?!
so all we have is ice?
okay.
oh. oh! (takes a slug of tequila.)
(does monica's) i know!
what?! we can not do that!
noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still does not give us the right to erase his message!
i do not think he is the one who needs help.
ugh!
okay, you are crazy! I am sorry, but she sounded generally upset! i mean, listen! (she hits a button on the machine.)
noooooooo!
no, wait. wait.
no, monica! monica! we have to fix this!
yeah well unless we tell him.
oh, maybe that is emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
right?
hey! hi!
hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
okay, just a little scared. what is going on ross?
what?! what? what happened?!
yeah!
(gasps) really?!
because a car backfired?
well, i-i-i do not know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, emily called you today.
no, she left a message. (he starts for the machine.) (stopping him.) but it-it kind of got erased. there is just (pause) something wrong with your machine.
well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right?
okay. thank you! thank you! because—I am sorry, all right. because y'know what? she did not want me—not important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right. (she starts for the door.) (stops) your decision.
okay, no, that is not the right decision. that is not, that is not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?
ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!
okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff.
i mean, look-look today you escaped (pause) (not believing it) death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?
well, there you go!
(laughing) close call day.
ohh, honey no problem. okay. (gets up.)
oh?
no. (she heads for the door again.)
yeah.
(going out the door) yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
(gasps) oh my god! oh my god!! that is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
oh, stop that! do not kid about that! (gasps) will all the stars be there?
oh my god! oh my god! i can not go! I am going to be too nervous!
no!! you are getting married! this is all i have.
I am fourth! (joey is startled.) look at you with your little maple syrup award!
what? no! it is not a big deal! i do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
yeah.
grammy, best new artist.
ohh that is great!
so you will definitely get onstage, even if you do not win.
well of course i do! but y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category joey. i mean you are up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
well joey, you will probably get it. but you should probably your-your gracious loser face. y’know when like the cameras are on you and you want to look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. y’know? so it is sorta like… (does it, you will have to see it.)
y’know?
oh no, at the grammies i always win.
(entering from her room) whoa what?
really?
not right now.
oh, see now i feel bad for the kid! i had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! y’know you—i could not concentrate and i blushed every time he looked at me. i mean come on, you remember what is it is like to be 19 and in love.
yeah.
i did not. i got under him.
i know! my god! do you have your speech?
do you got your gracious loser face?
now joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! you hug me!
on tv?! yeah!
joey! why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
oh my god you stole her award!
joey i do not think you know what behalf means.
joey, you have got to take this back!
(looking at the award) no! joey!
do you really want an award you did not win?
joey is says best supporting actress!
joey no, this is wrong! you have to take it back, okay? you do not want to win an award this way. you are very talented. and someday you are going to win one of these for real and that one is going to mean something.
all right? (he sets the award down.) thank you.
thank you.
i cannot believe I am going to meet jessica ashley!
okay, I am totally cool! (she coolly knocks on the door)
(coolly) hey jess.
‘sup? (joey glares at her.)
absolutely.
I will be out in a second.
(entering from her room) honey, we have to go. our reservations are at 8:00.
okay honey, you can finish this later we are going to be late. we got to go.
thank you.
hi! all right, let us go shoppin’!!
oh, okay.
wow! umm....
i know.
well, i told him i would think about it, but I am going to tell him no.
i mean i think I would say no to anybody right now. (hearing this gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) oh, but it was so strange. i mean I am standing there with this charming, cute guy, who is asking me to go out with him, which I am allowed to do, and i felt guilty. y'know, like I would be cheating on ross or something.
i do not have any issues with my father.
hi!
yeah. ahh, here is a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
oh, y'know, it is just like hats, and a shirt, and cd’s, just sort of stuff that you have left here.
no. ross, it, it just seems that y'know it is time we-we y'know, move on. i mean, i mean do not’ you think?
yeah?
good.
ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
okay, all right, give me the mug! I will keep the mug.
you know how much i love that t-shirt! you never even where that t-shirt!
oh, you are a petty man. you are a petty, petty....
petty... (goes into her room)
petty...
small...
you are so just doing this out of spite.
huh?
you have not worn that t-shirt since you were 15!! it does not even fit you anymore!
(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
oh. that is so monica can keep track. that way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘where is number 27?!’
y'know what?
i can not do this.
well, oh, mark, I am doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I am just doing it to get back at ross. I am sorry, it is not very fair to you.
oh god. I am sorry about this.
you sure?
(entering) hey!
oh, great. although i did sit down where there was not a chair.
oh, well, i guess i had that one coming. I am just going to throw it out, it is probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
(she takes the t-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) no. nothing. (she smiles and goes into her room.)
good. although y’know, he-he is a private guy. y’know, i wish i could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
so what are you saying; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
hi!
(to phoebe) okay.
okay. (gets up and starts to leave with paul.)
yeah that is great. but first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. tell me about your day.
okay. hey, what are you thinking? what are you thinking right now?
yeah that is great paul, but y’know i want to know what—(puts her hands on his shoulders)—wow, those are really great! i just want to know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. y’know they say that still waters run deep and i want to swim in yours.
no paul, i do not know anything about you! y’know, like-like your childhood! tell me about your childhood!
okay, well then how about puberty! come on, that is always a painful time! y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you are sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
well, you are lucky you never met that bitch sharon majesky. anyway, umm… the rest of you life, y’know? any regrets?
all right paul, I am not asking for a lot here. okay? just give me something. anything!
okay.
all right.
hm-mmm.
that is-that is great! see? i already feel like i know you a little better! thank you. okay, come on. now we can go eat. let us go. (gets up to leave, but paul does not move.)
oh!
yeah. yeah, i-i-i see the scare. listen, paul, i think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. it is really, it is beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
what?! wait! what are you talking about?! you love their kung pao chicken!
my god, I am sorry! I am sorry! i did not mean to do that! i would not do that!
oh my god! oh my god!!
like a little girl. i know. i know. i know. this is all my fault; i wanted him to open up. but god, i did not know that i was going to unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
what is the other one?
oh that is right. you are the talker. (they both reflect on that briefly) anyway uh, great idea! umm, i got to go to the store; i told him that i would buy him some more tissues.
no you do not!
hi. I am back.
ah that is great. no actually that is… (in a sexy voice) that is great! that is really great! y’know, i got to tell ya writing, i mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kind of hot.
a lover?
oh yeah surfer?
okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. wait, now wait a second, this is not too revealing is it?
i do not care about the little dude! i can not! i cannot listen to anymore of this! y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! and then it is only because they get paid $100 an hour! do you know how much money i could have made listening to you? $2,000! and do you know when i figured that out? while you were talking!
oh… I am sorry. i… i-i do not mean—i did not mean to stifle you. i… this is all just a little overwhelming.
I am so glad, I am so glad you shared. (feeling his shoulder.) and I am glad that you are done. what do you say we umm… (nods in the direction of the bedroom.)
(who has just entered) ugh! no more crying! please! i just dumped one cry baby, I will dump you too!
oh my god! oh my god! oh chandler!! (hugs him.) you guys are going to be so happy!
(gasps) nice! one and a half carat easy.
I am sorry, i was just reading the joke below it. man, that one is funny. (ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
we are looking at a playboy.
oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she is crying out, ‘where are they, where are they?’
you see, now, i would date this girl. she is cute, she is outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, that is got to come in handy
(thinks) i do not know.
monica, what are you doing?
(to monica) well, people are different.
what? wait a minute. what are you saying, that I am a pushover? I am not a pushover.
oh my … you think I am a pushover. well wait, watch this, you know what? you are not invited to lunch. what do you think of that? i think that is pretty strong, that is what i think. come on, monica, let us go to lunch. (she leaves)
i cannot believe her.
oh, oh, i love that japanese place.
all right, wherever you want to go is cool.
no.
joey, honey, i do not think you are supposed to go back there.
come on, joey, i did it and it was fine.
well, you know what? this is great. finally, i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too. let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse. first of all, the customer is always right. (joey nods.) a smile goes a long way. (joey smiles) and if anyone is ever rude to you? sneeze muffin.
phoebe. we would like to talk to you for a second.
yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, phoebe, are flaky.
so, what, you are just, you are just okay with being flaky?
yeah, and i am okay with being a pushover.
i am not a pushover!
wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think I have ever heard.
how-how did you lose your job here?
he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you have been working here two days? that is not, that is not right.
joey, you can not let him get away with that. ya know what, I am not going to let him get away with that. I am going to say something to him—no, i really should not say anything—no, i should say something to him. (goes to the counter) gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him…
what?
that is right, he can have his job back. I am glad we got that all straightened out. there you go, joey, you got your job back.
yeah, pretty nice, huh? now who is a pushover?
oh, I am sorry. (gets up and moves.)
oh, yeah. definitely you, pheebs.
hey. oh, i have a question. if-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
how was the honeymoon?
oh!
i did not know you spoke french.
oh... you are so sexy!
seriously stop it, or I am going to jump on ya.
ross...
my father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while i was at barney’s.
yeah, they said he is going to be fine, but he is still heavily sedated.
no, come on, I am totally ok. (hugging him) i do not need you to come! i can totally handle this on my own.
ok. if you really need to.
oh, i really could.
ohh... (ross mouths ha-ha at monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
(stopping a nurse who is coming out of a room) oh, uhm, excuse me, I am here to see my father. my name is rachel green.
ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? that actually means something here.
can somebody please go in?
ross, please, do not be so scared of him!
oh! (they enter. rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) oh! oh my god! ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer i got him was just money down the drain, huh?
oh, great, are you going to be ok?
hi!
uh. (pause) did you call your parents?
oh good.
what?
what do you mean? you have been in my room before!
ok i got to tell ya, it is really weird when you use my whole name.
yeah.
yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? i mean he is a doctor, you do not expect doctors to get sick!
(she is sad) ow. i do not want him to wake up alone! i should go to the hospital!
what?
really, i should not feel guilty?
ok, maybe you are right.
wait, wait, wait, wait. would you stay here with me for a little while?
ok. (she sits on the bed and ross sits near her) thank you for coming with me today.
rachel green is very happy you are in her room!
i just do not want to be alone tonight.
wait, we will not know that until we do it, will we?
taking advantage? I am giving you the advantage, enjoy!
wow. ok.
mhm-mh!
(she turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) sure. (she gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at ross)
(coldly) yep.
fyi..
in the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
(sarcastically) really? well, it seems to me if you would done the right thing, i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
oh stop that!
(sarcastic) oh, that is so hot. she walks around him to the other side)
oh, really, well ross, you know what? i am a big girl. i do not need someone telling me what is best for me.
oh, really, really? well, it was not very good for me either. (she turns to leave and ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
what?
oh, good.
okay... hey listen, just before you go i-i again, i just want to say "thank you" for coming with me.
and also, you know i uh, i was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it is probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
it is a shame though, i mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
you know it was you are uhm... birthday...
well, i guess that is all in the past, now.
(after a pause) not even one more time?
no matter how much we want it.
that is what we decided.
...it is kind of hard though!
you know, when two people have a connection, you know, that is... just seems like such a... waste.
...ross?
just so you know... with us... it is never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
hey, you guys! guess what? barry and mindy are getting a divorce!
barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend.
yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. is not that sad? (giggles.) god, could you imagine if i actually married him?! i mean how different would my life be?
merrill lynch?
well why did not you take the job?
(gasps) rob tillman!
oh, I am sorry. ross tillman.
ohh, of course monica’s brother!
wow! how are you?!
ohh! me too!
oh, it is the best! (they both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) so, umm how is monica?
ohh, i would love too.
ohh! okay!
oh wait, do not you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) busty ladies?
(laughs) oh yeah? okay.
but! do not you have to give him his money back?
ohh, so do you! did you lose weight? (she is not quite sure of that one.)
oh yeah.
oh yeah. right. so now, are—do you, do you still do music?
(interrupting him and seeing joey) oh my god! joey tribbiani from days of our lives, just walked in here!
(stunned) you are friends with dr. drake remoray?
he is coming over! he is coming over!
(giggles and can not look at him) hi!
(still not quite able to look at him) hi! i love you on that show! i watch you everyday! i mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…
ah!
wow! this is so amazing! what else? what else?
hey!
(laughs) wow! umm, y’know, i-i would really love to, but i-i should not.
(awestruck, then not) is not that a line from the show?!
that is a line from the show too!
yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
(mouthing it to him) yes, you did.
oh mon, listen i have to ask! okay, joey tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
ohh! and I am one of them!! wow! oh, i just cannot believe this! i mean, joey tribbiani!
yeah. oh i just wish we could not be married for a little bit! y’know i just wish we could be like on a break!
oh, it is so easy for you i mean, you are not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
monica. you have, you have done it right?
oh my god! you are a 30 year old virgin!
oh my god!! do it!! honey, you have waited long enough!!
yes!! i mean sex does not have to be a big deal! there should not be all this rules and restrictions! y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…
oh what do you know? virgin!
(very relived) oh! thank god!
okay! (she picks up the phone, joey’s phone number, and starts to dial.) here we go! okay! (on phone.) hi, joey! it is rachel! umm, i am free tomorrow night. yeah, sure, sure i can bring some sandwiches.
ohh, i mean it is just so realistic!
pat the dog. oh! oh! i get it!! (laughs and finishes her drink.)
oh, i probably should not—so i will! (joey starts making her refill and rachel notices that rain thing joey has.) oh! wow! it is like it is raining!
umm, can i use your bathroom?
okay. (starts to go.) god y’know, if someone told me a week ago that i would be peeing in joey tribbiani’s apartment…
yeah, it sure is!
joey, you are such an amazing actor! (he smiles.) how do you know where dr. drake remoray leaves off and joey tribbiani begins?
wow! tell me something joey—(she falls off the couch)—whoa! i just fell right off the couch there.
okay. (she climbs back onto the couch.)
yeah?
wow! i can not, i can not feel my hands.
(wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) oh right.
(groans) oh god. oh i can not believe joey tribbiani heard me throw up!
noo! oh god we did—we did not, we did not uhh…
god I am just a horrible person.
because I am married. that is right, i am a married woman! and i came to a tv star’s apartment to have an affair! uck!
yeah and I am a horrible, horrible person.
the ring from the cave, yeah.
(seeing the ring and gasping) oh my god, they let you keep that stuff?!
no! no-no-no…
but i thought that ring stood for caprice’s undying love for her brother.
yeah!
ohh! my god! barry!!
oh that is right! I am sorry! i-i am early! finish! please!!
hi ross!
is joey tribbiani here?
well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I am looking for him and that this i am not going to throw up!
me? I am great! I am fine! I am sooo good!! but, you know who is not great?! men! you are a man right ross?!
sit down!
let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! and why is it that the second we tell you we are going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!
no seriously! seriously! what has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
aw what are you?! a detective?
oh. (does not believe it.)
who are these men?
well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.
good day for married people huh?
I am sorry your wife is gay. i guess women are not that great either.
do what, do what?
no! phoebes! do not you remember why you dumped the guy?
well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
ok, ok, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney.
pete the weeper? remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) "was it good for you?"
how did we end up with these jerks? we are good people!
pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
or?
burning's good. yeah, i got stuff to burn.
oh my god. janice, hi!
oh, joey, look who it is.
ok, pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we would not be doing the ritual in the first place.
(tossing things in the fire) ok, barry's letters. adam ritter's boxer shorts.
(looking at picture) hey he is wearing a sweater.
and here we have the last of paulo's grappa.
really?
so, um, will you bring the truck?
oh, my god.
oh, they are firemen guys.
(entering from her room) okay, got to go! wish me luck!
uh well, y'know what? i do not think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
okay guys, way to wish me luck!
well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric (on the other one.) sorry.
(laughing nervously) oh, what a fun office.
oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
i know! it is like I am being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they will-they will be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I will just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she is going to pick? me or smokey smokerson?
yeah, i can do that.
i would love to!
oh well, it is kind of lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air.
oh great!
oh that is okay.
excuse me, can i, can i bum one of those? (he holds up his pack.) y'know what, actually… (she takes the one he is smoking and heads over to where nancy and kim are standing and laughing.) okay, okay, okay, what is so funny over here?
oh, i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? y'know what i mean, like dubbies? and i actually, i thought to myself, "wow, those guys are crazy!" but no, i actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
oh, me too.
(laughs) oh, me too.
oh it was great! it was great! i went down there just like you said, y'know? and we talked business. kim totally took my opinions.
thanks!
well-well that is because i went down there and they were all smoking. this is actually the smell of success.
i did not!
all right, fine! but i had too! i had to do it for my career!
no well, no it is not that bad, y'know? i mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, i actually feel like i can throw up.
i am so on board! (she throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
yeah, i did, but y'know what? i am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? (laughs) good luck, rach.
well then let us just quit! we will just quit! let us all quit!
oh but you could. you can. absolutely! we can help each other out! we can get--what are those--those patches! we could be like the patch sisters!
yes! great! give me those cigs! give it! give it! (she grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
okay then! (she starts rummaging through the trash to find kim's lighter.)
hey! hey-hey-hey!!
come on you guys! what are doing?! i thought we were the patch sisters!
well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could have at least told me! come on, give me one of those! what are we talking about?
oh wait, no-no-no! drag me down. drag-drag me down.
okay. (starts to walk away.)
(hearing that) oh man!
what?! what?! my birthday's not for another month!
oh my god! you guys this is so great! i mean it is so unexpected! i mean chandler's birthday is even before mine!
wow! this is great! look at all these cups! this is so weird.
oh, okay, not so weird.
i am so going to miss watching you freak people out like that!
you-you are not wearing a jacket.
hi, pheebs? okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she is not coming.
honey, listen, y'know what? the nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
(entering) monica? you going to be very proud of me. i just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
they are male nurses.
anyway, they want to take us out saturday night! what do you say?
what? what are you talking about?! you-you are the one who is been telling me to get over ross and move on. I am moving on, and you are moving on with me. come on, give me one good reason why you do not want to go.
what?
okay, you are coming with me, and i also told them that if we are still here when they get off that we will go down to the cafeteria and have some jell-of with them.
joey, how do you make that dirty?
honey, y'know i just got to tell you, i think this is such a terrific thing you are having these babies for frank and alice.
yeah!
yeah!
ohh, I am going to be on the news!
okay, phoebe, honey, you got to be kidding. i mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
yes! yes! yes, i do! i do know! frank and alice are going to want to keep all of their children!
phoebe, no! this is, this is insane.
me?!
no! forget it! i am not going to ask frank to give you one of his kids!!
no, i have not had a chance to be alone with him yet.
y'know who i always liked? mork.
yeah, but umm… yes, but, fonzie was already cool, so he was not hurt, right?
hi!
monica, this is dan (points to him), one of the guys that we are going to be going out with on saturday. (mouths "he is yours." to her.) uh dan, monica.
hi!
oh, honey, do not worry. she is going to make it on time.
yeah. so frank, three babies. whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
yeah, fair enough.

yeah, that is true.
chandler, what did she say?

ooh, i just feel bad, i never vacuum. (she goes into chandler and joey’s.)

hmm-mmm.

i do not even know how i would go about it.
you know what, I am going to do that, I am going to call him up, and I am going to ask him out. i can do that. ask him out. (practising) how you doing? (calls him) hi! joshua? it is rachel green from bloomingdale’s. (listens) yeah, umm, i was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? well, we found a wallet, and we—(listens) the license? well, that is a good idea! uh, well, let us see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I will see you tomorrow. bye. (hangs up) (to phoebe) you have done that a thousand times?
ohh, god, i just got so nervous that he would say no.

would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (tries again.) you know, its funny, basketball, because i happen to have tickets too… (tries again.) umm, who likes the knicks—(joshua comes in from the dressing room.)
oh! well, as a single woman, who is available, i think you look great!
yep. oh, yeah, look you great. (she puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) oh yeah. yeah, this looks great. (pause) umm, so you like it?

yeah-eah-ha!
oh well, you do not want to do that now?!
okay.

he did not turn me down! he is at the game is not he? i got the date, I am just not on it!
wow! monica!
honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
really?
yes! i will! absolutely! (she takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. she then proceeds to act like dark helmut in spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) hello, rachel. hi, joshua. i left my wallet here on purpose. really? yes, i just wanted to see you again. oh, I am glad. rachel, I would like to say something to you. yes? how you doing?
so uh, pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
whoa! hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
hormones!
nooo!
all right fine! you are not invited to the party we are going to have either.
well umm…
little village people.
oh, that is so sweet!
huh. except, phoebe’s not going to be the one that gets to dress them.
oh my god! we are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she is always wanted!
hi! phoebe. (both monica and her try to move out of phoebe’s way.)
no we…
…hormones, yeah.
oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to ross’s wedding.
it just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
well, h-how is this like that?
(starting to cry) I am-I am sorry, i just thought that…
good.
what?! she made the tea! (points to monica.)
you what?
okay. it is okay. we are going to be okay. y’know what? it is okay. I am going to, I am going to, I am going to boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
okay! (runs and grabs a book and hands it to monica.) okay! here!
i do not know!
i still do not get how you know when it is false labour.
well, is not that a good thing? you said you were sick of this.
no, really. really, pheebs, you are not going to be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they are bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on ritalin when they just will not calm down. y’know?
and you just get to be cool aunt phoebe!
and y’know what else, oh my god, are they going to love you.
oh!
what?!
(to the woman sitting in front of her) he-he said rachel, right? do you think i should go up there?
mon, honey, i got to ask you something.
ross said my name up there, i mean, come on, i just can not pretend that did not happen can i?
monica, what should i do?
what?
whoa, wait, listen, i think I am just going to talk to ross about what he think it meant.
okay, you are right. you are right. you can not help me.
oh, hi!
hi. sorry, things are not working out so well.
oh yeah! of course, i mean, she is going to get over this, y’know? i mean, so you said my name! y’know you just said it ‘because you saw me there, if you would have seen a circus freak, you would have said, "i take thee circus freak." y’know, it did not mean anything, it is just a mistake. it did not mean anything. right?
right…
(laughs) y’know when i locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because i was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
get the hell out of there, y’know?
well, look at that, same thing.
ross said my name. okay? my name. ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (they both just stare at her.) okay, do not believe me, i know I am right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
okay.
hello? oh, pheebs! (to them) it is phoebe!
hi!
well, ross said my name.
okay, pheebs, y’know what, let us look at this objectively all right? ninth grade, right? the obsession starts. all right? the summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. so then…
(entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there is a whole cart outside… (sees the walthams and stops.)
(she stops and turns) hi!
well, i-i-I have been on standby for a flight home for hours.
ohh, so no sign of emily huh?
so umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
yeah. I am sorry.
no, you are not an idiot, ross. you are a guy very much in love.
no, you know what, i think you should go.
yeah, i do. i think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, i think it would be really good.
oh, come on ross! i think it would be really good for you!
yeah.
good!
right!
right!
okay, I will see you back at home, if i ever get a flight out of here.
what? wait, what?
well-well, i do not know ross—really?
uh-huh.
oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. umm, yes, i can do that!
okay!
all right!
oh, okay, we are going. yeah.
oh, wait-wait-wait…
okay. wait! wait!
ahh, yes, i will have a glass of the merlot and uh, (points to ross’s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. woo! (looks out the window.) hey, look at that, the airport’s moving. (realizes that that is not how it works.) hey, are we moving?! are we moving? why are we moving? hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we are moving? (sits back in defeat.) oh my god. oh, my gosh.
(to joey) coffee. (hands it to him.)
(to ross) cappuccino. (hands it to him.)
and a nice hot cider for monica. (hands it to her.)
yeah?
oh! that is why. (rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I am sorry!
... the wenus?
(sarcastic) oh. that wenus.
no. but do not worry, I am sure they are still there.
career counselor?
i do not!
the meeting with the guy went great?
what are you going to make?
(pause) and monica, what are you going to make?
(trying to sound like a bug) bzzzz.... i love you, ross.
so what are you guys going to do?
my god! what happened to you?
(comes up and rubs him on the chest) oh chandler, i know, i know... oh, hey! you can see your nipples through this shirt!
(hurt) waitressing?
but, but?
oh! i see. and I have sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that i can waitress in the olympics.
who was that?
oh... that is too bad. bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
no.
mon. i wish i could, but I have made plans to walk around.
done.
well hello! welcome to monica's. may i take your coat?
what is up?
what?
ok, ok. I am with you, cheech. ok.
let me, let me get you some wine!
excuse me? can i help you with anything?
you do not want to work for a guy like that.
maybe, but should not we wait for chandler?
listen y’know what sir? for the last time, i do not care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch dr. do-me-a-little!
are you joking? check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.
yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. until y’know, he screamed out radisson at the end.
(entering) hi.
shh-shh-shh! the guys do not know yet do they?
do not worry i promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘because I am going to tell the father today.
ew! no!
well then you have his baby.
yeah. uh-huh, i guess it is pretty big news.
well it is only different if he wants it to be. i mean, I am not going to ask him for anything.
hey joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
oh joey! joey! no, it is not you! you did not get anybody pregnant!
not yet.
no! phoebe, it is not gunther.
phoebe the father is not here okay? i have not told him yet and i do not think i can tell him at all now!
i do not know, let me think. i was walking down the street thinking, ‘I am going to tell the father today’ and then bam!
no, you! phoebe you freaked me out. you kept saying how huge this all is!
i know, but i was just thinking about how huge this is for me. i did not even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
what? hey wait a minute! phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
oh god… oh, he is in there right now?
uh, let us rip!
oh phoebe!
nothing! phoebe kind of made a mistake. but y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
oh, it is just not the right time.
okay.
tag…
I am having a baby.
you can go.
tag is not the father! and joey knows now?
oh wow, you did not even try to unhook my bra!
no, i will. I am just not up for it tonight.
I am not?
what?
no! joey, oh you are so sweet. you are so-so sweet, honey. but I am not, I am not looking for a husband.
now, if you will excuse me i am going to go and lie down. (exits.)
hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
ross, thank you. hey, do you guys want to go see a movie?
okay, umm, I am going to get my sweater. (walks away.)
oh? yeah! sure!
oh but phoebe, we are going to be late for the movie.
yeah, we are, we are actually just going to walk ‘because it is right up there at the angelica.
(to the driver) okay, stop-stop! phoebe?!
what was that?!
i have not seen it yet!
noooooooo!!
hey!
ugh, the worse day! y’know, you think you are making progress at work and then your boss calls you raquel.
i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel! by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky!
what?
oh my god! that is so great! I am so happy for you guys!
and that was so sweet of you to ask! oh my god, the three of us are going to have such a good time living together!
and chandler, you are going to have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know raquel can not be late.
ohh! this is so exciting! oh god… (gasps and starts to sing) come and knock on my door…
(entering) hey roomie!
(gasps) are you pregnant?!
um-hmm.
(laughs) oh my god! oh, that is funny, i can not believe i did that.
okay. (sits back and resumes her reading.)
sure? (monica hands her one.) thanks.
monica, where did you get these?!
ooh, good god, they are so yummy! (she re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
hey!
okay!
okay.
(grabbing the star) what the hell is that?
wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate!
mon, honey you are not dying. I am just moving out. y’know, i mean we are going to see each other all the time.
are you okay? you are not blinking.
oh, all right. but y’know i got to say, i do not, i do not think six years counts as an era.
what is the matter with you?!
all right, fine, but do not get mad at me. it is-it is just a little hard to believe.
well y’know, it is you guys. you-you do this kind of stuff! y’know? i mean, you-you were going to get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess I am not upset because i do not see you guys going through with it. I am sorry.
but i…
it is? really?
(starting to lose her composure) i mean we are not, we are not going to live together anymore?
what? oh my god! I am going to miss you so much! (starts to cry.)
i mean it is the end of an era!
monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing.
thank you.
oh! so you are driving up to connecticut?
yeah me too. oh! i have an idea. why do not we all pitch in 50 bucks, we will pool our money together and then if we win, we will split it!
yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what I am saying.
joey relax! my mother picked her up two hours ago. you were there!
she dropped off a casserole?
(to monica)what is going on?
well, there is two spots left right?
oh no, I am good, i do not want to get that turkey smell all over my hands.
you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you going to feel if we actually do win?
oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you going to feel? you know, we are going to be all like "oh everybody, let us take our helicopters up to the cape" and you are going to be all like "oh, i can not guys, I will meet you guys up there, i got to gas up the hyundai"
i do not really care about the knicks.
(touched) you would do that? i never get picked!
I am hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
ooh, i have another idea!
well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
ok, well monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? how are you going to feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it is the last you are going to hear from us!
(surprised) oh! alright, you know what? that is it! i want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!
ok, that is it! just give'them to me! I will split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from joey's hands but she can not, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)
oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets.
oh, it is so unfair. it is like that time they promoted sandra over me at work.
no, she was just much better at job than me!
(to ross) you know what? we should call my mum's house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down.
hi mum, put her back on!
(on the phone) mum, please!i know you love your new lips, but i can barely understand you! would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
(she goes towards the others and she is very excited) guys, you are not going to believe this! i was just saying goodnight to emma and she said her first words!!
she said "gleba"!! (she celebrates)
(to ross) is not that amazing?
why-why are not you more excited?
oh, but of course it is!
i do not know all the words.
ok... "emma just said gleba"!
okay, okay, okay, fine, I am going to look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).
(searching the dictionary) alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) gleba! ha! here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
you know what? there is a little part of me that really thought we were going to win.
what?
so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
me too.
so mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.
huh—wait so joey if you get this, you are going to be like the star of your own tv show! i mean you will be like the big cheese! (to phoebe) or the big mac—hey! you love those!
joey, what are you talking about? you are a terrific actor.
ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
 I am sorry, what?
 (on the phone) monica, I am quitting! i just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she did not even buy it! (pause) I am telling you I am quitting! that is it! I am talking to my boss right now! (pause) yes i am! (pause) yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! okay bye, call me when you get this message. (hangs up.)
of course he will! but chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
already? that is pretty bad what you did.
I am sure he will forgive you. look, we have all been there! y’know, you fight, you make up, it is just the way it works.
yeah! you and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
what?!!
(mocking him) you fell asleep?!
y'know i can not believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
and hey! just so you know, it is not that common! it does not happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!
that is the most ridiculous...
i did not sell you out.
would you let me talk. [flicks monica on the forehead]
ok, well, you would not let me finish and i was jus- [monica flicks her back] ow. that hurt [flicks monica]
fine!
no?
oh!
oh, uh, joanna i was wondering if i could ask you something. there is an opening for an assistant buyer in junior miss…
well, actually, i meant for me. the hiring committee is meeting people all day and…
god, i am so glad you do not have a problem with this, because if you did, i would not even consider applying.
(interrupting) and that is I am so glad… there is no problem.
ohh! that is great!
really?!
well, i, umm…
thank you.
well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
yes, joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
i-i-i of course, i have more responsibilities than that.
yes, i realize that…
i love working with designers!
(entering joanna’s office) umm, joanna? i want to talk about that interview.
no! it did not! that is what i want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) i may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
there is nobody here!
do you want me to quit?
well of those things that you said in the interview, i mean if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant. y’know what? i am just going to pack up my desk, (she goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and i will be gone by the end of the day! (realizes she has nothing.) well, i guess there is no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! (starts to leave.)
what?
my drinking?
said what? exactly.
oh my god!! ohh, that is it! I am leaving! you are just a horrible person!
say more things like that.
I would need an expense account.
and an assistant.
hey mon, little question for ya! how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
oh my god!! you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but I am soo happy!
ohh, you have waited soo long.
hey, pheebs, quick question for ya.
how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale’s?
yes!!!
ohh, it is going to be so great! I am going to get to help decide what we sell, I am going to have an office with walls and everything. (turns to monica) I am going to have walls!
I am an assistant buyer!!
oh, hi mrs. lynch! is joanna in already?
heard what?
oh my god! how?!
oh my god! oh, i cannot believe it!
oh, god. oh, god. (gets worried) oh god.
yes, so close. mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. but by any chance did joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.
yes-yes, just a few seconds and she would still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?
oh, sophie, i guess you did not hear about joanna…
who wrote it?
okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
(entering from the bathroom) hey mon? I am going to check my messages.
(on phone) hello? (shocked that someone answered.) uh, rachel. (to the gang.) great, someone is in our apartment. call the cops!
(on phone) oh my god! oh my god! thank you! (hangs up) that was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
well, he did not say, but it was a fire. I am guessing not very good. come on, we got to go!
my god! (they both run into the bedrooms.)
everything’s ruined. my bed. my clothes. look at my favorite blue sweater. (hold it up.)
fine! I am sorry for your loss! (hands it back to her.)
(stands up) wow! oh-okay, look pal, i am not in the mood to be hit on right now! but if you give me your number i will call you some other time.
okay phoebe calm down, there is no need to place blame. okay? (to the fireman) i warned her about those candles.
oh my god! it sure did not look this way when i lived here.
hey! hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault pheebs. okay? it was an accident.
okay! (she jumps on the bed.)
i have.
i did.
i did, monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
what?
well, do not look at me! my hair’s straight! straight! straight! straight!
oh.
oh, joey! sorry!
oh but look! that is going to leave a stain!
really?
I have never lived like this before.
i love it at joey’s!
thanks!
hi!
uh-huh.
no, no-no-no. phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I am fine here.
no! no! phoebe, come on! i do not want to switch! please come on! i can throw wet paper towels here!
i know. I am sorry.
well obviously i will not be able to come, for those of you who have not checked their calendars today is my due date. well y’know, i just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you have been during this time. i really could not have done it without you. and i have loved these last nine months! and even though i am so looking forward to the next part, i am really going to miss being pregnant.
that is right, still no baby! (to monica, joey, and chandler on the couch) come on people! please make some room!
you. like you have not done enough.
god. (sits down.) i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
(interrupting her) oh phoebe, that is a great story. can you tell it to me when you are getting me some iced tea? (phoebe gets up and rachel groans.) (to the baby) oh god, get out! get out!! get out!! get out!!
do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘because I will do it.
they sent me home from work. they were like, "start your maternity leave now! just rest, get ready for the baby." well y’know what? screw ‘them! if they do not want me there, I will just hang out with you guys.
(overhearing that) what-what about me?
i do not. but i would still like to be acknowledged. what? just because I am pregnant you think I am invisible.
oh, i have to pee. if i do not come out in five minutes it is because I have choked to death on the potpourri stink. (goes into the bathroom.)
(calling from the bathroom) all right, who is turn is it to help me get up!
oh, i have to go pee. apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (goes to the bathroom.)
in a minute!!!
(entering) all right, all right. let us go!
no, I am fine.
ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am somewhat comfortable.
oh uh-uh pal! do not call me mommy! it is bad enough you call your own mother that. (he looks at monica.)
ross.
can i ask you something?
when carol was pregnant with ben…
…were you this irritating?
excuse me?!
well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
(silently) okay. (pause) seriously, breathe louder ross! that is great!
hi dr. long, how are you?
she has the drugs!
okay. (rachel lies back.)
yeah.
eh, just a tad.
well, we are ready to try anything.
okay.
great! we will do all of those.
hi!
no. but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
well, there is one thing that we have not tried, but someone thinks that, (mimicking ross) "that will open up a can of worms."
why? why today?
I will take that bet.
well, I am miserable here! i might as well make some money out it!
oh honey, do not worry. i really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
ross i—we tried all the spicy food. it is not working.
i am feeling nothing. speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
oh come on ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! we know what is going to work! it is doctor recommended!
oh come on ross, we have done it before we will do it again, it will be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
make love? what are you a girl?
but you will, you will be performing a service. okay? just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
oh, i know it. you are right. that is not sexy. oh…oh! (drops a fork on the floor.) whoops! oh, i seem to have dropped my fork. let me just bed over and get it. (tries too, but can not quite seem to make it.) oh god!
come on ross! I am miserable here! come on! you started this, now you finish it! come on wuss, make love to me.
what?!
oh wow! what now ross you are not going to talk? how on earth will you ever annoy me? oh wait a minute, i know. (mimics his breathing.) i mean you would think the damn jalepeno would have cleared up your sinuses, but no!! that is not enough… (ross jumps over and kisses her.) what are you doing?!
(breaking the kiss) oh god!
oh no. no-no! i think my water just broke.
okay! i got the keys! okay! okay!
yeah.
i did not uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…
okay.
(entering) hi!
oh ross, come on! you just did what you had to do.
terrible? hell, i was in greece! that was a nice hotel! nice beach, met the nice people. not to shabby for rachel. (goes and puts her luggage away.)
well, yeah! we are cool. totally cool.
oh no, you are the best.
what?! i did not have a good time in greece! ross abandoned me! okay, i could not get a plane out, so i had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "oh, mrs. geller, why are you crying?" i mean, it was sooo humiliating. i felt like such an idiot! i mean, it is all my fault! and you know why, because i make very bad decisions.
yes it is! it is true! i went, i went after ross in stupid london.
phoebe, you were right. i should have never gone to london, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
that is fine. so monica, you are now in control of my love life.
ohh, he is married! ross is married. i can not—i still can not believe it. (rachel grabs the picture from monica)
i mean, y'know I am just going to have to accept it (she grabs the rest of the pictures)…
…i mean it is my fault.
oh my god! (she licks the top picture and hands them back.)
yeah, i guess gunther is kind of…
oh, i do not know. i do not know.
all right, you are the boss. i guess i got to do what you tell me.
hey!
well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. got myself a date tomorrow night.
well…
that is not european!
oh god, i really had a good time!
yeah. umm, unless you want to come inside?
okay. oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? i uh, i can not decide this. umm, okay, just hold on a second.
umm, hi!
is monica around? i-i have to ask her something.
what is that? (points to the box.)
oh, honey that is awful.
but, it is not raining.
y'know what ross? you are not going anywhere. you are going to sit right here. I am going to make you a cup of tea and we are going to talk this thing whole out. all right? (she goes out to talk to dave) hey, dave!
umm, listen, I am going to need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. okay? bye! (she goes back in to talk to ross.) honey, listen, i know, i know things seem so bad right now.
yeah. (she goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)
ohh! you did not drop any socks!
well, ultimately, i was trying y'know, i-i wanted…tell him y'know, that I am still in love with him.
why? why not?! people love to hear that!
well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you are fired.
well… (at a loss for words, she grabs some of monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow rachel to run back inside and close the door. monica chases her to find that rachel had locked the door.)
no.
well, then talk!
yes!
I am going to do it.
but i…
all right, fine.
(stopping him) hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! ho-ho-hold on a sec there, mr. kissey! y'know, I have been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new european thing you got going on, and i just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and i just—y'know—stop it!
phoebe, woo!
yeah, y'know what? I am-I am going to meet you upstairs in a minute.
well, y'know what, that does not matter.
yeah, i-i do not care.
what 'cha readin'?
yeah, what is it about?
okay. uhh, ross, y'know what, there is something that i-that i have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that i should not tell you, but i think they are wrong. i mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
okay, ross, I am really trying to tell you something here.
okay.
umm, okay, i think I am-I am just going to-just going to say it. just going to say it. uhh, (pause) I am still in love with you ross.
(laughing) I am so dead serious. I am totally serious.
because (laughs), because, i just heard it. i heard it, and it is ridiculous! i mean, you are married. you are-you are married and it is just ridiculous, and it is like, it is like when said it, i sort of like, i floated up out of my body, y'know? and, and-and then i heard myself say it and then the floating rachel (laughs) was like, "you are such an idiot!"
(laughs) I am sorry, that is not funny.
oh god, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that i told you this?
the thing is y'know, that you are married to emily.
ross, things are not going to be weird between us, right? i mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
that is what i said! thank you for being so nice. (they hug.)
high-five, the babies are coming! (they all high-five.)
hi, sweetie!
I have got some bad news.
i can get a quick bite to eat, but then i have to come back up here.
nooo, he is leaving for a better job.
well we are going to miss you around here.
yeah, you bet.
funny book?
yeah, at the lecture, i told you that last week, you said you did not mind.
oh, please tell me it is not because I am going with mark.
oh my god!!! ross!!
because, he is my friend.
okay, well if i stop playing with joey and chandler, can i play with mark?
i do not know, you thought ‘see you saturday’ was funny. look honey, mark is in fashion okay, i like having a friend that i can share this stuff with. you guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
really!?
okay. honey, i would love for you to go with me. (ross has a worried look on his face) what?
oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
nodded off!! ross you were snoring. my father’s boat did not make that much noise when it hit rocks!
well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to professor pitstains and he is ‘hey everybody! remember that thing that is been dead for a gazillion years. well there is this little bone we did not know it had!’
okay, see now, what i just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
oh, that is so...
y'know if what i do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? huh? was it so i just would not go with mark?
it is not dumb. but, maybe it is okay that you are not a part of it. y'know what i mean? (ross looks confused) i mean it is like, i-i-i like that you are not involved in that part of my life.
honey see, it does not mean that i do not love you. because i do. i love you, i love you so much. but my work it is-it is for me y'know, I am out there, on my own, and I am doing it and it is scary but i love it, because it is mine. i, but, i mean is that okay?
what?!!
hello
oh that could not have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
nooooooooo!
well watching sharks? are you sure that is what he was doing?
man sharks. i always knew there was something weird about that dude. but you promised to love him no matter what.
ah! you know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can not understand, you know i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.
yeah i did not disguise that very well did i.
(sits down) hi
so basically you have slept with all the woman in new york and now you are just going around again.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
yeah your both so slutty you do not even remember who you have slept with, you are made for each other.
that is it! you just barge in here, you do not knock
you have no respect for anybody's privacy!
no, you wait! this is ridiculous!
what? what?!
oh!!
he is so cute! and he seems to like you so much.
okaaay. (to the guys, on the couch) any of you guys want anything else?
no, I am sorry, we are all out of those. anybody else?
okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change.
nice? they were nice. i mean, that is it? i mean, mittens are nice.
i know, i mean, why can not parents just stay parents? (she walks over near chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) why do they have to become people? why do they have... (notices chandler) why can not you stop staring at my breasts?
did you not get a good enough look the other day?
c'mon, he is right. tit for tat.
you are right! i mean you are right! it was not just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles' cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in.
hi, I am rachel.
bathroom's up there.
hey, listen, ronni, how long would you say chandler's been in the shower?
perfect. fasten your seatbelts, it is peepee time. (she goes into joey and chandler's apartment, where mr. tribbiani is reading the paper) hey, mr. trib.
chandler bing? it is time to see your thing.
i thought it was chandler!
you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing!
we hate that guy.
we are sorry.
wow.
just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
what happened?
what the hell is that?!! (to monica) what the hell is that? is that you? (monica nods her head no, and rachel realizes what is making that sound.) ohhhhhhh! (storms over to chandler and joey’s with monica in trail.)
(angrily) back off!!! (she starts banging on their door.) get up! get up! get up! god damn it! get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
what is that noise?
well, I have been up since six. thanks to somebody is dumb-ass rooster.

okay, well, we won that one.
yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.

chandler gets it! it is chandler bing!
(shouting) it is all relative!!
(shouting) I am sorry!

oh-oh-oh, he is a transponce—transpondster!

(entering from chandler’s bedroom, i guess, and sees the foosball table.) oh my god! i can not believe you guys are actually think you are moving in here!
well i-i-I am not moving.
no, it was a stupid bet! we were just playing a game!
noooo.

(she holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)
that is right! you do what the hand says!
how did it go?
y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
that is not true. she did! she forced me!
well it stupid, unfair question!
will you stop calling it your apartment!
no it is not!
oh, i think i saw some in here.
i do not know! but maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it will die.
yeah?
may fifth, why?
ross, you guys went out once. you took your kids to chucky cheese, and you did not even kiss her.
well, have fun!
yeah, she is...
you love her.
(entering, with a guy) hi guys! this is josh. josh, these are my friends, and that is ross.
ross, did not you ah, play soccer in high school? oh no wait, that is right. you just organized their game schedules on your commodore 64.
okay. (he starts to leave, and rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I will miss you.
i know, is not he great? it is so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? there is nothing boring about him, and ah, i bet he is never set foot in a museum.
y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that does not have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
what was that?
oh. (she tries to walk away from josh, by he keeps holding her) stop it!
yeah! (monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (josh leaves) i am soo going to marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) ohhh!
i think he is stealing from me.
because he is stealing from me!
ughh! (storms out after him)
well where is amanda?
i mean y'know, I am thinking. you could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
why do not you just marry her? oh no, wait a minute you can not, I am sorry i forgot, she is not a lesbian.
(laughing) ohh, that is soo sad.
hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! at least he bought me something with it! (shows her, her ring)
sorry.
y'know...
yeah.
no!
(confused) okay.
(really confused) okay.
oh, let me see! (grabs picture) oh, god, is he just the sweetest thing? you must just want to kiss him all over!
pardon?
oh, no, no, no. presents first. food later. (walks into living room)
ok, I am guessing this is from...
well, thank you, melanie.
(picks it up) ok... ah, it is light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it is... (opens it) travel scrabble! oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)
this one's from joey... feels like a book. thinks it is a book... feels like a book. and...(opens it)...it is a book!
who is this from?
oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) oh my god. he remembered.
it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can not believe he remembered!
what did you just say?
no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
oh.... my god.
i mean, this is unbelievable.
no! none! i mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so i just... (to joey): w-well, what else did he say? i mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
ross? all this time? well, I have got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)
i-i-i do not know.
i do not know. maybe I will know when i see him.
noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. i mean, this is just too big. y'know, i just, I have just got to talk to him. i... i got to... ok, I will see you later. (opens door)
ross! excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
hi.
oh, no, no, i do not have one. i just need to talk to my friend.
no, i know, but i—he just went on. he is right there, he is got the blue jacket on, i... can i j-just...
ok, alright, ok, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? please? this is very important.
uh... i do not know.
i do not know. i do not know... i thought about it all the way there, and i thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it is ross. y'know what i mean? i mean, it is ross.
i do not know, i mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I am thinking... oh, I am thinking it would be really great.
(confused) huh?
i do not know... sometimes it does not.
no!
no, I am just....
wha...
no! there is.. there is noone else!
yeah.
from you. i exchanged the blouse you got me.
uh, yeah. uh, monica, y'know, honey, I have been thinking about it and I have decided this—this whole ross thing, it is just not a good idea.
because, i feel like i would not just be going out with him. i would be going out with all of you. oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and i do not want to...
monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you are already so...
who is it?
c'mon up.
would you excuse me, please? I am trying to have a date here.
so I am thinking about you. so what?
well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
ross, it is too hard.
ross, you are like my best friend.
if we broke up, and i lost you...
well, have you been involved with someone where you have not broken up?
i do not know... i mean, I have never looked at you that way before.
wow.
right! you are right!
you know what?
i forgot... i am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. i am so sorry! I am so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) i mean—I am sorry. i-i-i got to go. I am sorry.
(sifting through crowd) excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. hi.
how did it go with pete?!
so, come on, what was the big news pete wanted to tell you mon?! or should i say mrs. monica becker?
why?! what is it?
yes!!
y'know i do not, i do not understand guys, i mean i-i would never congratulate monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.
yeah.
oh, ah with who?
oh-oh-oh, which one is bonnie again?
oh! (laughs) that is fine.
(to phoebe) well that was depressing, i think i just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from fame. ready to go to the movies?
this is bonnie? (to phoebe) this is bonnie? (to bonnie) you are bonnie?
oh no, I am sorry, you look a lot different from the last time i-i saw you.
oh, that must be it.
(to phoebe) you said she was bald.
how could you not tell me that she has hair?
(looks in the window) ohh, well, this is just perfect!
yeah, i said what was okay when i thought she was some weird bald chick. i mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
why, does she have a bad personality?
(seeing ross and bonnie inside central perk) oh my god! phoebe look, it is ross and that girl.
phoebe! (goes back to the window)
come on phoebe, look at that! they are not breaking up, look at them. okay that is, you know what that is? that is a, that is a second date, that is what that is! look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
ohh! (walking away from the window) phoebe, this is all your fault! now he loves her, he is going to marry her, and this is all your fault.
you said she was bald!!
phoebe, we can not, we just can not just let it happen! okay, we have to do something! we have to break them up! okay? just go in there and like, shave her head! you owe me one bald girl!!
(quietly) yes.
yes.
i just y'know, i did not expect him to be this happy so soon. ufff. ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)
what?
oh!
oh, i can not watch this. (turns her eyes away)
you want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you have got a girlfriend?
(shocked) oh my god.
oh my god. i cannot keep having this same fight with you ross! look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
no. a break from us.
then, we had this big, stupid fight, and i said i wanted to take a break, i do not want to take a break.
nobody.
umm, honey, look he just came over to....
hey.
well, we never actually got to dinner.
no, we kind of broke up instead.
(looking up at the ceiling) god, monica it is on the ceiling.
yeah, but it is okay, because when ross left mark came over.
no.
no, no-no, it is okay, calm down. mark and i talked, and i realised how much i love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but i really want to make it work.
(on answering machine) hi, it is me. I have been trying to reach you all night. i feel awful. please, ross, you got to know there is nothing between me and mark. this whole break-up thing is just stupid.
eh, I am just so sorry i put you through it. and, i y'know, i do not want to get back together over a machine.
so, i love you.
and y'know what, I am going to, I am going to go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I am going to stop by around 8:30.
bye.
hi. ohhh, you got my message.
so what do you say? can i be your girlfriend again?
i can not talk to you. i can not even look at you right now!
just get away from me!
a mistake?! what were you trying to put it in? her purse?!
ross, you had sex with another woman!
(opening the door) y'know what, i want you to leave! get outta here!
just get out! now!!
okay! all right! how was she?
was she good?
come on ross! you said you wanted to talk about it, let us talk about it!! how was she?
good different?
whoa!! whoa, whoa, wait a minute. what time did your little friend leave? (ross can not answer that) oh my god. she was there? she was still there? she was in there, when i was in there?!
and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
we were on a break!
you think you are going to get out of this on a technicality?
well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
god! and to have to hear about it from gunther!!
oh, that is so sweet. i think I am falling in love with you all over again.
all right. let us say i had slept with mark. would you have been able to forgive me?
you would be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
I am thinking, I am going to order a pizza.
fine. (on phone) hi! yes, I would like to order a large pizza.
with ah, extra anchovies.
yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
well, i should think so. you slept with someone.
that is....
that is neither here nor there.
no ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) do not! you can not just kiss me and think you are going to make it all go away, okay? it does not work that way. it does not just make it better. okay?
(softly) i think you should go.
(softly) i really think you need to go now.
yeah, what the hell did i know!
(crying) no. i can not, you are a totally different person to me now. i used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. god, and now i just can not stop picturing with her, i can not, (ross stands up and backs away) it does not matter what you say, or what you do, ross. it is just changed, everything. forever.
then how come it is?
(coming from her room) hi, sweetie.
hi! oh, ross, do not forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!
yep! happy and healthy! and cute!
popular.
oh yeah! I have come up with a bunch of ideas!
really?!
okay! i was thinking if it is a girl, how about sandrine? it is french.
okay fine, what do you have?
wow, oh my god, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
I am really, really not.
all right.
yeah! i do not think you are going to need it though. okay, check this out. if it is a girl, rain.
why?
ross, why do you hate our child?
okay, james.
but only if it is a girl.
oh! I am sorry! are we having an 89-year-old? how about dayton?
veto. sawyer?
veto.
oh, oh my god! i can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
but you have it right there in that file? you could tell us whether it is a boy or a girl? dayton or sandrine? phoebe or phoebo?
right. right.
(looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) so, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
third one from the left?
what?!
i did not!
okay fine, i did. but i did not see anything, i swear.
okay, but ross just listen to me…
but i could not even if i wanted to, because i do not know! i swear; i did not see anything, and i do not want to know! it was just a momentary lapse.
(holding stomach) okay, a couple months late on the lecture, ross.
hey.
you know what? I have been thinking about it. I am really coming around on the name ruth. i think i would actually consider naming our child that.
i did not see anything! i actually changed my mind about the name.
i would—sequoia?
fine.
but ross, you want the name ruth!
what?
ross, i swear, i do not know.
a what?!
we are having a girl?
that is what you just said!
you said girl!
I am not! we are having a girl! sometimes i can not believe it is with you—but still! we are having a girl!
oh, yes! we will have ourselves a little baby ruth…
yes, please.
(entering) hey! ross and i were looking for you! what are we all doing in here? (looks at chandler) oh, my! (covers the spot where joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)
no, i was waiting for you!
we are having a girl.
(entering) hi, sweetie.
shhh do not say that loud, gunther's going to want to hug me.
ok, you know what, I am just going to take her outside.
ok, thank you.
oh, wow, molly is just great!
what? you really think she is hot?
and joey?
am i the only one who does not think that she is hot? ross?
thank you! (goes to get coffee)
so hot i cried myself to sleep last night. (joey and chandler clap their hands)
hello.
gavin, i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an appology.
well, when we first met, you know, i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
no, i just mean that, you know, first impressions do not mean anything. and i-i think you are a really good guy and I am sorry that i misjudged you.
hello. (to gavin) but you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, i am just really really happy ... (sees gavin staring at heather) I am sorry, obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so I will just wait 'till it is finished.
i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
oh wow, you are really, you are really a creep.
oh yeah, I am jealous. "oh gavin, please, please look at my ass". (gavin starts looking) stop looking at my ass! i mean, i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she is your subordinate.
that is totally different for two reasons. one - i did not know that you knew that. and two, i was not some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
it was ... (can not remember) oh my god. he did not have a last name. it was just "tag". you know, like cher, or, you know, moses.
oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name was morgan! huh!
yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
(to joey) hey, listen, joey, about molly, i really prefer if you did not go after her.
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i would not want anything to, you know, drive her away.
rachel green's office!! give me that phone! (takes the phone) hello, this is rachel green, how can i help you? uh huh ... ok then ... I will pass you back to your son (gives phone to gavin)
um, excuse me gavin, i have a question i need to ask you.
if you like looking at butts so much why do not you just go look at a mirror?
oh, please, i do not care about you enough to bug me. in fact, from now on, I am going take the high road. and I am going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
hi!
yeah i am, i am! oh, but first of all, monica, i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle.
oh no no no no no, gavin can not, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
why did you invite him?? i can not stand that guy!
i was faking it! can not you tell when I am being fake?
hey, mr philips, nice suit!
shh!
(to monica) i still can not believe you invited gavin. allright, he is the last person i want to see.
god, i hope he does not show up. of course he is not going to show up, the guy hates me.
what?
oh, monica, you think skippy liked you? honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
oh, ok, thank you. (molly leaves) (to monica) do you see what all the guys see in her?
yeah, sure!
oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and mon jump up the sofa)
ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
whhh wait, you are going to leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up?
yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
mmm hmm.
no.
well, it was, and you would have seen it if you did not showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? god! oh, this party was lame ...
oh, you bought me a present! why?
aww. well, ok, well that is very nice. and you wrote a card (opens the card). "from gavin"
(opens the present, it is a green scarf) awww, awww, it is beautiful.
see, gavin, you are capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time?
well monica seems to think it is because you have feelings for me.
you do?
see? why, gavin, why? right when I am about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
you know, I am thinking about letting emma have her first cookie.
I have never given her a cookie. have you?
of course, I would be honored!
oh! what is it the anniversary of? your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
amy! hi! oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) wow! you remember joey?
so now, what are you doing here?
(emma starts crying in the other room) oh sorry, hold on. let me just check on the baby!
god!
oh, i know, is not she?
all right. what is your news, amy?
what? oh my god! to who?
a-and??
no, what is he like?
yeah.
huh... wow, so he is got to be...
sweety, i got to tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
oh... sit down, sit down. oh, honey, you know, i once also almost married somebody that i did not love. do you remember barry?
sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying barry was the best decision that i ever, ever made. honey, you deserve true love. your soulmate is out there, somewhere. someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
ok.
ok, let us keep talking.
amy, hi!
oh, good for you!
yes you are! oh, i am so proud of you!
but erin brockovich had her own house.
yeah... amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘myron, get off!’
joey, i can not do that!
well joey, uhm look, i know that she is difficult, but i think it is really good that she is here.
no, it is just... look, you know, when i first moved to the city i was a lot like her! i was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
well, uhm... whatever, i have really appreciated it, because i do not think i would be the person that i am today if it was not for you guys. see, i want to help amy the way you guys helped me. and i know it is going to take patience, but that is ok.
amy, that is what i was supposed to wear today, that is why i hung it on the door.
amy, you know what? i was thinking that maybe now it would be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
well, what happened?
oh, that is so tacky.
phoebe, that is huge!
i think it could be kind of great!
(sarcastically) uuuh!! how about at a footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)
(takes the phone) oh! that is interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
(into the phone) hello? (announces to amy) oh, it is our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) hi! oh... god! i hope you feel better! ok, bye! (hangs up) (to ross) that is molly, she is sick. can you watch emma today?
menstrual cramps.
(to monica, chandler and phoebe) can any of you watch emma?
(to ross) great, shoot, what are we going to do?
(thinks for a moment) well, actually...
yeah.
why not?
(defends amy) wha.. well, ella's a nice name!
(shocked) wha... the next one?
ross, i am trying to help her become a better person. this is a huge breakthrough for her! she just offered to do something for another human being!!
ross, I am telling you, she is giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? do you understand how important that is in our world?
absolutely.
(to emma) hey! hi, how is my girl?
(sounds excited) yeah!
(not excited anymore) you pierced her ears!?
you pierced her ears? how could you do this without telling me?
oh my god, oh my god, here comes ross. he is going to flip out.
ugh. (takes the hat and covers emma's head and half her face with it)
nah, i do not really want her to see.
nothing.
oh, they are real!
i know, i know, and you were right ross. (to amy) you are soo irresponsible i am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
i can not believe this. all i wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
oh yeah? since when?
(looks at ross and then at amy again in disbelief) what?
(shouting) babies do not care if they are slim.
joey, get amy's bags, she is moving out!
you put holes in my baby's ears!
(gasps) i can not believe i ever even tried to help you. you are so beyond help.
excuse me?
(yelling) joey, where are those bags?
(does not believe what she is hearing) seriously?
hips or thighs?
(gasps) oh! oh my god! i thought she was on atkins.
(embarrassed) oh, i can give you that.
yeah. i just, i kept trying to make you a better person, but you are... you are already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
did you just say emma?
so how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
that is shocking!
I would say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
ohh, I am going to miss that big old squishy butt.
well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
well, i never thought I would say this, but I am going to go use ugly naked guy's bathroom. (does so.)
what?!
oh my god!
oh my god!!!
phoebe!! phoebe!! it is okay!! it is okay!!
i know!! i know!! i know!
yes, i know! and joey knows! but ross does not know so you have to stop screaming!!
(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) hi!! hi!
nothing! oh god, we are just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
uh-huh, doing it. doing it. phone doing it.
joey! come here! come here!
phoebe just found out about monica and chandler.
no. joey, she knows! we were at ugly naked guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (joey gasps) actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
wh-what do you mean?
ohhh, i-i would enjoy that!
ehhh, no, i want to do phoebe's thing.
you do not have any secrets!
(to phoebe) so umm, how-how are we going to mess with them?
okay.
hey mon, what are you doing now? want to come see a movie with us?
oh.
okay great, hold on a sec! (she runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) oh, here you go! you do not mind do ya? that would really help me out a lot! thanks!
hey ross! any word on the apartment yet?
oh.
what?! you-you actually thought that basket was going to get you the apartment?
all right honey, we would better go if we want to catch that movie.
oh ross, honey you got to stop torturing yourself!
y'know what you should do?
you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. yeah! like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. or uh, or my underwear.
(to ross) see?
yeah, he broke those too.
hello! (listens) oh yeah! hey! hold on a second she is right here! (to phoebe) it is chandler.
are you kidding?!
i can not believe he would do that to mon—whoa! (she stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at joey. joey is avoiding her eyes.) joey, do they know that we know?
joey!
ugh, i knew it! oh i cannot believe those two!
all right. be sexy.
oh yeah! (she gasps.) oh my god! that is our friend! (monica covers her face.) it is naked ross! (monica turns and buries her face in chandler's shoulder.)
show time!
okay! (she runs to get some.)
(handing her the wine) okay honey, now I am going to try to listen from right here!
okay? whoa, wait! (she undoes one button on phoebe's dress.)
yeah, oh wait! (she goes for another one.)
joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner phoebe breaks chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
okay!
hey!! do you have to do that? it is saturday!
i hate this apartment! i hate the color of these walls! i hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! i hate that singing guy!
stop it! i will kill you. i hate the fact that my room is so small.
monica, you do not even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
I am sorry. I am so sorry.
(entering) hey!
so—hey, pheebs! so, how are the elves?
yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
yeah.
do you guys want these?
ohh, well you got ‘them.
just give us our apartment back!
oh, come on! we know what these are worth.
you are bachelor pad?!
or I will give them to my new boyfriend, joshua.
all right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
let me finish.
I am talking about a bet, winner takes all.
oh, okay, well, i think we should let phoebe decide, because she is the only who is impartial, and she is so pretty.
what? shut up! we are winning!
okay.
all right, cut, let us pick again, pick again.
come on apartment! come on apartment! (picks a card.) oh! i know queen is high!
we took our apartment back!! (slams the door shut.)
all right. we figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
let us keep the apartment and…
yeah! can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
yeah.
yeah, i-i heard. (pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for rachel’s reaction.) i think it is great! (hugs ross.) ohh, I am so happy for you!
oh my god. oh my god. (she decides to make a break for it.) excuse me. move! move! emergency! excuse me! (she tries climbing over a bench and falls down.)
oh, there you are! hi! oh, so, so, how was china, you? (hits him with the flowers.)
what?
i am? oh, look at that, yes i am. enough about me, enough about me, mr. back from the orient. come on. i want to hear everything! everything. (looks at julie)
these are, these are not for you. (to julie) these are for you. (loudly, thinking she can not speak english.) welcome to our country.
ok, well, not a problem. we will just use them to stop the bleeding. ok. baggage claim? ok.
(entering, out of breath) airport, airport. ross, not alone, julie, arm around her. cramp, cramp.
(to chandler) you, you, you said he liked me. (ross and julie enter) you, you slowpokes!
(out of breath) julie.
and the chicken pooped in her lap. oh, I am so sorry. i just gave away the ending, did not i? oh! it is just, i just heard this story in the cab, and it is all i can think about.
julie! julie, is not that great? i mean, is not that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
bye. (she closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
yeah, sure.
did you talk to him?
then, no.
(to ross) here is your lemonade.
oh. well then, you better go take that back because they are going to charge you for that.
go-go-go-go, come on! (ross goes over to the counte) (to chandler) so uh, what did you find out?
how is that the silver lining?
she did not hang up either!
(taking the phone and hanging it up) sorry, i thought you were talking to me.
okay!
(to monica) ok, ok, ok. how did this happen to me? how did this happen to me? a week ago, two weeks ago, i was fine. ross was just ross, just this guy. now he is rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that i can not have.
i know you did. I am just going to deal with it, I am just going to deal with it. (ross comes by, smoching with julie on the phone.) i got to get out of here. (exits)
(poking her head in from her bedroom) uh, morning. do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
well, i sorta did a stupid thing last night.
ok, paulo, why do not you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. (paulo goes into his room.)
i do not know, i just kind of ran into him last night.
at his apartment. is this juice?
oh god, i know I am a pathetic loser.
yeah, he is back. is that a problem?
good! I am glad it is not a problem.
how is she?
I am okay.
what?
when i saw him get off that plane with her, i really thought i hit rock bottom. but today, it is like there is rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
come on. how can i just tell him? what about julie?
i do not know, i do not know.
(sticking her head in from the balcony) wait, are you leaving?
well, can i talk to you for a sec?
well, first of all, paulo and i are not back together. it was just a stupid thing i did, and if i could go back in time and do it again, well, i would not. um, second of all (ross is laughing), what?
no. no-no-no-no.
really?
no, i think that was the whole all.
no. no no no no no. that is rodney mcdowell. andie mcdowell is the guy from planet of the apes.
you are welcome.
thanks for dinner.
so.
i say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.
i am sorry, i do not know, i am sorry, i do not know why i did that!
ok, so sorry.
i am sorry! again... i do not know, i do not know what happened, i must be nervous!
ok, ok, ok. i promise, i promise, i promise, i will not do it again. i really do. i promise. this is going to be great.
absolutely! absolutely. i d... it is just a little weird, it is you, and it is me, it is just going to take some getting used to.
ok, let us work from the top down! (joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) just work the bra, joe!
okay.
oh!
ow!
well this is romantic!
it is a standard issue bra clasp!
ok well, well I am really, I am sorry about that joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you do not want to take off my bra?
(laughing) oooh! oh oh!
oh oh! what is up with miss hawaiian tropic?
well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and i kept slapping it away!
well, it was not just me, alright? he freaked out too! he could not even undo my bra!
i do not know what is wrong with us, i mean, we have kissed before and that is been great! but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me.
(looking thoughtful) ok, that is true. that is true, we can do this. you are right, you are right, we can do this. we are just going to power through!
(to joey) no need!! problem solved, we are powering through (at which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
hey! got champagne?
excellent! stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...
ok (starts to light some candles) sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (claps her hands and jumps at joey, clearly very excited) alright! let us do it!
oh! get over it soldier, we have got to do this! (she pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) ok. aha! you like that huh?
you like that? (she climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to joey's hips.) let us take this into high gear (she pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. she puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
yeah baby, I will show you how we do it!
what? oh my god! I am so sorry. joey? are you ok?
what is the matter with us?
no, i mean with us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
no, no, no... no, i mean... se-x-you-ally...
well, just because it happened that way for them does not mean it has to happen that way for us.
right, totally.
yeah, and if does not work, then we will be just one of those couples that never have sex.
i know.
hmmm... me too...
i wonder how monica and chandler could do it?
aah... i bet you are right.
yeah.
love you too... alright, I am going to bed.
oh-oh! okay, she is kicking!
whoa!!
wow that was a big one.
hi!
oh yes i do. i do. i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. and do you know how you find him? you stop looking for him. that is why i stopped looking for russell crowe. he will find me.
(to phoebe) well, what is he like?!
uh-huh.
of course, of course.
oh sure. older?
oh, i was just going to ask!
oh, it is so sad they never had a chance to meet.
joey? what is up?
okay what is up?
well honey, I am late for a meeting. so can you just make it quick?
sure! that sounds great! just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. okay? (walks away.)
…and i know chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. i mean I am really worried the baby’s not going to like him. (joey is staring at the table.) are you okay?
no. not-not for me, but why do not you take off your sweater?
oh my god! really?! can i see it?
huh. wow, i would not think hobbs would like that so much.
um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. wow.
yeah.
so you were saying?
okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and i said, "eight years." and the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.
(stunned) what?
(looking around) who are you talking too? oh, you are kidding! oh, it is a joke! (laughs.) it is funny. it is funny. i do not get it. (joey does not say any thing and rachel realizes it is not a joke.) oh. (pause) okay. umm… i-i…uh, wow. are you uh… how did umm… when?
wow! wow. wow. wow, it is hot in here.
joey, joey i love you so much, but i…
joey.
no! joey please! please do not! please do not leave like this! now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (starts to cry.)
can i? (hug him.)
oh joey honey i do not…i do not want to lose…
I am so sorry.
yeah, that was a real good one.
so if you think i did not say goodbye to you because you do not mean as much to me as everybody else, you are wrong. it is because you mean more to me.
what?!
shh.. go back to sleep. i have to go home.
it really was. you have learned some new moves!
ah.
i know!
morning!
hey.
good. you?
chick and the duck? did not they die...
you too. last night was just wonderful.
i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
uh-huh. i know. it was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (she hugs him, and ross looks crushed.)
hi!
hi! so i just dropped emma off at my mom's.
no, we decided that i would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday.
are you kidding? eight hours with my mother talking about atkins? good luck, emma!
yeah?
(touched) gunther... oh... i love you too. probably not in the same way, but i do. and, and when I am in a café, having coffee, or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I will think of you. aw.
oh... bye guys.
hi! you guys, the car-service just got here. i can not believe they are not home yet! i have to catch my stupid plane. i want to see the baby!
oh my god!
hi! oh my gosh!
oh.
what... what...
aw..
oh my gosh. wow, so beautiful.
oh, you guys, i can not believe this. but I will leave now, or I am going to miss my plane.
me too. oh, I am just sorry I am not going to be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! alright, i can not say goodbye to you guys again. i love you all so much.
i will. ross, come here.
i just want you to know.. last night.. I will never forget it.
alright, now i really have to go. okay. au revoir! oh, they are going to really hate me over there.
oh my god! i was so afraid i was not going to remember any of my high-school french, but i understood every word you just said!
oh.
oh, shoot. i had it. oh, i can not believe this.
i have it, i have it, i have it. oh, okay, i can not find it, but i remember that i was in seat 32c, because that is my bra-size.
okay, fine! but you know what? if i was in 36d, we would not be having this problem.
oh! shoot! damn it! where is it? oh! oh! i found it! i found it!
hah! i found it! i told you i would find it! in your face! you are a different person.
hello?
yeah.
phoebe? is everything okay?
what? why?
oh, honey, I am sure there is nothing wrong with the plane.
alright, look, i have to go. i love you, and i will call you the minute i get to paris.
oh, that was just my crazy friend. she told me i should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left philange.
i would not worry about it. she is always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? she is almost never right.
well...
wait, what are you doing?
could i get some peanuts?
this is ridiculous! i...
yeah, okay.
oh my god... what.. what are you guys doing here?
what? what? ross, you are scaring me. what is going on?
yeah?
what?
oh my god.
i - i have to get on the plane.
yes, i do.
they are waiting for me, ross. i can not do this right now, I am sorry. I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
(on the answering machine) ross, hi. it is me. i just got back on the plane. and i just feel awful. that is so not how i wanted things to end with us. it is just that i was not expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you are there and saying these things... and... and now I am just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have said, and i did not. i mean, i did not even get to tell you that i love you too. because of course i do. i love you. i love you. i love you. what am i doing? i love you! oh, I have got to see you. I have got to get off this plane.
(on the answering machine) excuse me?
(on the answering machine) I am sorry. I am really sorry, but i need to get off the plane, okay? i need to tell someone that i love love them.
(on the answering machine) oh, please, miss, you do not understand!
(on the answering machine) oh, come on, miss, is not there any way that you can just let me off...
i got off the plane.
i do love you.
okay. because this is where i want to be, okay? no more messing around. i do not want to mess this up again.
okay. you and me, alright? this is it.
i know. it seems smaller somehow.
(crying) do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
okay, should we get some coffee?
no. no, you can not.
oh i do not-i do not know.
yeah actually, i think we are going to take off too. we rented a movie.
uh pheebs, we just actually kind of wanted to be alone.
oh. (they leave, leaving just joey and ross.)
you want to go in the bedroom? it is a little more comfortable.
okay. (they start to head for the bedroom) oh wait! umm, did you send those contracts to milan?
no seriously, y’know the contracts i gave you, did you overnight them?
okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that i do not get.
y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (he starts laughing.) tag! I am serious! this is not funny! those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
yes i did! and i put a little post-it on it that said, "must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then i put a little heart in the corner because i did not want to seem to bossy.
y’know what tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
no! come on its late, we are not going to go down to the office.
okay get your coat! (they get their coats and start to leave. rachel suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) oh! when did you unhook this? (her bra.) nice work!
oh how can you possibly know? look at this mess, tag! i mean, this is what I am talking about! you have to be organized! you have got newspapers! you have got magazines! you got—ohh! (finds a picture.) and who is this chippy? a little young for you tag, but whatever.
okay, very cute braces. anyway y’know what, the point is tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (she goes into her office.)
in the afternoon. mr. zelner came into my office after lunch. he put them on my desk, and then i put a post-it on it (looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the post-it on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave tag) that said, "must go out today." so you just keep looking in there! all right?
puzzler. a bit of a puzzle. why do not you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
i do not know tag! how can your genitals make phone calls? okay? it is not a perfect world! just go please.
thank you. (he leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. she then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) hello? (hangs up the phone.) i still do not get it.
hi! i got you some coffee. to, uh… (she looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. so! do you got anything for me?
oh my god! did you check your entire desk! did you check all the drawers!
well yeah, i wish that you would. (he opens the top drawer.) well, no it is not in there! (closes it.) how about that drawer? (she points to the bottom one and he opens it. she does not see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
(thinks) y’know, i do not-i do not know. let me, let me check. (as she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
can i see you in my office for a minute?
you put these on my desk!
oh really? so you are saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (i think dogbert should have a line here.)
(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) i am so hot for you right now.
um... yeah. well, i mean, when i first met you, y'know, i thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
yeah, but then you spent phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then i figured maybe not.
oh my god! calling from rome! (takes phone) bon giorno, caro mio.
monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? talking to rome. (showing off to phoebe and chandler) I am talking to rome.
(exasperated) yes, chandler, that is exactly what it is. it is your hair.
so, um, did she...
aw. hey, pheebs, want this? (gives her a pencil)
sure. i just sharpened her this morning.
oh, you-you mean your earrings?
(sticking her foot out) hm-m.
yes. paolo sent them from italy.
oh no! my new paolo shoes!
(humouring him) oh, well you know who i love the most?
you!
(still trapped under ross) pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
hey, who is this little naked guy?
aww, look at the little thing.
wow, monica, you look just like your grandmother. how old was she there?
oh monica that was the best thanksgiving dinner ever! i think you killed us.
yeah, you know what we should all do? we should play that game where everyone says one thing that they are thankful for.
oh, you are not going to tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
i know monica's worst thanksgiving.
what?! joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
actually, y'know that is not the thanksgiving i was talking about.
no, it was not. it was actually the…
oh, yeah, i had too. there was never any parking by the psychology building.
oh hi!
no, god! please, let me! (runs out.)
hey!
(entering) oh-ho, my god! that was so awesome! you totally got him back for calling you fat! he was just drooling all over you. that must have felt so great!
what?!
okay, that we may be able to do.
well guys tend to get naked before they are going to have sex.
okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's going to ever take it. then, second of all you are not actually going to have sex with him! you are just going to make him think that you are.
yeah.
then, you will definitely get him back!
okay, oh, here is what you do. just act like everything around you turns you on.
well, like anything can be sexy. like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (she grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! and-and if i feel a little hot, i can just dab myself with it. or i can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while i talk to him.
yeah? okay! good, good, because he is coming. he is coming. (to chandler) hey, what is up? (she leaves and closes the door behind her.)
you brought a carrot?!
everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
yeah, well, word of advice: bring back the comedian. otherwise next time you are going to find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
has anybody seen my engagement ring?
oh god, oh god, oh god oh god oh god oh god.... (starts to look under the couch cushions.)
oh, like i was not dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'hi barry! remember me? I am the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' oh god and now I am going to have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with...
(looks at the lasagne and realizes something) ohhhhh, do not be mad...
oh, i am sorry...
oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
so what are you going to do?
you are twins?
all right, you guys, i kind of got to clean up now. (they all start to leave.)
the lights, please..
I am just cleaning up.
uh.. okay, sure! thanks! (she hands him the broom and sits down.)
oh.. a little..
a lot.
so, got any advice? y'know, as someone who is recently been- dumped?
oh, you have got carol tomorrow.. when did it get so complicated?
remember when we were in high school together?
i mean, did not you think you were just going to meet somone, fall in love- and that would be it? (ross gazes at her.) ..ross?
oh! man, i never thought I would be here.. (she leans back onto his hand.)
barry?
(hesitates) are you sure?
I am- uh- I am okay... you look great!
i dumped him.
oh, not much. i-i got a job.
why are- why are you so tanned?
oh no. you went on our honeymoon alone?
mindy?! my maid of honour, mindy?!
oh! well, um.. (grabs his forehand) you have got plugs!
and you have got lenses! but you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
okay..
wow.
what?
anyway, um, (gets the ring out of her purse.) i guess this belongs to you. and thank you for giving it to me.
(on phone) hi, mindy. hi, it-it is rachel. yeah, I am fine. i-i saw barry today. oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. no, no, it is okay. i hope you two are very happy, i really do. oh, oh, and mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- i just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (slams the phone down.) (to everyone) okay, i know it was a cheap shot, but i feel so much better now.
chandler, there is a guy right over there. (points to the counter)
chandler, do not worry! this does not make you any less of a guy! (chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) that does! (chandler stops blowing.) what am i sitting on? (she looks and finds a huge nail.) i hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
hmm.
well, here is another question for ya. uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
okay, good. now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
guess who we ran into today?!
you are not. you have never been able to break up with her.
(entering, with joey) hey!
y’know, you-you also could have used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
it is coming from joey!
please, ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
(starts laughing, ross stares at her) I am sorry. I am sorry. you are right, you are a tough guy. you are the toughest palaeontologist i know.
oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.
you…are…not going to believe it! joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
no. but i was showing him some cufflinks and i felt his pulse.
(refers to the table) what are these?
okay, okay, okay should i be scared?
wow! if only more people knew.
hey!
(noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that were not there originally.) what-what are-what are these?
oh my god! look at this!
i do not care! the wires have come loose in your head!
and did you?!
oh my god.
hello, mrs. chatracus.
thank god.
hi!
so, I am in my apartment doing the soap opera digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (she hands the magazine to joey.)
so did they call you to tell you your name’s going to be in this?
oh, come on joey! you will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! and you deserve that! and if you do the interview you can mention, oh i do not know, gal pal rachel green?
okay, do not listen to him. please?
come on! we will be there for you the whole time! just remember gal pal rachel green. (excited) ha-ha! I am going to be in soap opera digest! and not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (looks at joey.) seriously, proud of you.
oh yeah, I would actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
that is the coast guard.
it is a trifle. it is got all of these layers. first there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch. [joey and ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef saut�ed with peas and onions, [joey and ross look like something is wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!
oh! yay! look! there is a piece that does not have floor on it!
hey, come on now!
(interrupting him) hi! I am gal pal rachel green, and if you want the dirt, I am the one you come too. this might be joey’s baby (rubbing her stomach), who knows? I am just kidding—seriously, (leans into the cassette recorder shelley is using) gal pal rachel green.
(scoffs at him) yeah, that is going to get you into soap opera digest. well i…(leans into the microphone again)…i would just like to say that joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
you too!
oh, joey! sorry!
oh but look! that is going to leave a stain!
really?
I have never lived like this before.
oh my god, jill!
this is chandler. (points at him.)
and you know monica and ross!
and that is phoebe (points), and that is joey.
do not!! (joey backs away frightened.)
yeah!
wow! i can not believe they did not put it in the part where you said you did not watch soap operas.
(to monica) i mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
that is so cool.
(sarcastic) ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
(approaching) hey!
ross gave it to me.
ohh, thank you.
well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, i am here to tell you that hats are back.
oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
(to monica) allll done!
okay, who is next?! (she looks around the room, and stops when she comes to ross.)
come on, please?! I am boredddd! you let me do it once before.
yes! (she starts creeping up on him)
just once!
take it like a man, ross!
oh, come on!
really?!
oh, yeah.
(reading a card) okay, your band is playing at arnold’s, collect three cool points. which means, i have five, and that means i get joey’s boxers!
(getting up) all right, I am going to make more margaritas! (she pours the rest of the pitcher into ross’s glass.)
I am just making margaritas.
what?!
oh, come on!
monica, please?
(pause) he is, is not he? i do not know, i do not know, i mean maybe it is just being here at the beach together or, i do not know. but it is like something... (she is interrupted by the sound of bonnie entering)
(entering) well! is everybody else having just the best time?!
well i assume the ah, happy couple is not up yet. did you guys hear them last night?
oh, great.
I am going for a walk.
oh, ah nothing. i just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.
ohhhh, sorry i missed that.
ohh-ha-ha!
y'know, i got to tell ya, i just loved your look when you were bald.
ohh!
really?!
i mean you definitely should do that.
yeah!
awww, stop. come on. now go shave that head!
aww pheebs, that sucks!
hi!
that was her idea, i just gave her a nudge.
hey!
come on see, she does not look that bad.
i do not know.
all right! ross, do you think it is easy for me to see you with somebody else?
yeah, because i was mad at you, not because i stopped loving you!
noo.
oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
noo! maybe! i, i do not know. ross, i still can not forgive you for what you did, i can not, i just, but sometimes when I am with you i just, i feel so...
i just, i feel, i-i just...
i feel...
well! good night. (to ross) I am going upstairs.
what is the matter?
so what-what is the exhibit.
hi!
i mean ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
umm.
yeah.
ooh, the gift shop!
oh, wait yes, but i can not eat too much. paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
what?! no! why?!
i did not know you could get married here.
oh sorry did not mean to interrupt. it is just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
yeah hon, it can not hurt to put your name down! i mean in if two years if you are not engaged you just do not use it.
I am going to do it too!
really? who would, who would you marry?
oh pheebs.
(from another room) oh my god, what a great surprise! this is such a beautiful house.
it is so secluded up here.
i feel like we are the only two people in the world. (she sets down her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) oops. sorry. (she reaches down to pick it up and ross hands it to her. ross is hiding under the couch and causes rachel to scream.)
no-no! big bear! big bear outside! i think i-i—would you—actually, would you go check on that?
well, okay. would-would you get me a diet coke?
okay. (after paul leaves rachel drops to the floor to confront ross.) what?! what are you doing here?!
i came with paul!
get up!
ahh. thank you!
op, ice. i need ice.
thank you.
ugh! get out! get out! go! come on! (ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) no! not in there! he is in there! (she points ross to the door next to the kitchen.)
go-go!
ohh, thank you.
well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room ross is in) and do your homework?
that is your, that is your dad’s bedroom. (yelling) that is your dad’s bedroom!
whoa, that diet coke just went straight to my head! woo!
really? okay. okay, i-I will go upstairs. (to paul) if-if you get me something from the car.
surprise me.
(yelling) so you are going to be in the car, i will be upstairs, and that is where everybody’s going to be!
(yelling from the living room) oh wait-wait-wait!! no! do not go in there! do not go in there! i need another soda!
oh my god ross! what in heaven’s name are you doing here?
wait a minute, you are only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
honey, no one thinks you are a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. (she notices something hanging from monica’s nose, as does joey.)
oh my god, jill!
this is chandler. (points at him.)
and you know monica and ross!
and that is phoebe (points), and that is joey.
do not!! (joey backs away frightened.) (to jill) honey, what are you doing here?!
wow! what did he say?
oh! did you hear that?! my dad’s proud of me! my dad’s proud of me.
oh yeah, sorry. wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
jill, honey, i think this is the best thing that could have ever happened to you. i mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! and you know when i did it, i-i-i at first i was scared, and look at me now! I am the only daughter dad is proud of! okay, well this is, this is what you are going to do. you are going to get a job, you are going to get an apartment, and then I will help you and you can stay with us. right pheebs, she can stay with us?
(entering) hey! what is going on?
(notices jill’s bags) jill! did you shop?!
you went shopping?! what, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under jill’s nose when you know she is trying to quit. wow, you guys are terrible!
what did you get?
oh.
apartment pants?
no, of course, of course I have heard of them! ross, what did you get?
a pajmena?
really?
jill?
oh, come on! you think that is going to work on me?! i invented that!
all right, it is okay. one little setback is okay, just do not let it happen again, all right? now since daddy paid for all this stuff, i should take it all away. but I am just going to take the-the pajmena. (ross hands it to her.) and the uh, and the uh pants. y’know what, I am just going to take it all away, ‘because that way you will just really learn the lesson. okay? all righty, I am going to run a couple of errands and i will see you at dinner. (leaves with all of jill’s stuff.)
hey!
what is up?!
well, it would better not be about the apartment pants, because i just pitched the idea to my boss at ralph lauren and she loved it.
what?!
with ross and jill?
with ross and my sister?
with my sister jill and my ex-boyfriend ross?
oh there is no way.
oh my god! i can not believe that! i mean i do not really like it when ross goes out with anyone, but my sister is not that like incest or something?! oh my god, and they are going to have sex! oh! oh no what if he marries her too?! oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. and i can not stop it! i can not—i do not own ross! y’know? and jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! and oh my god, i can not believe ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. oh my god, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
(on the couch) oh hi! y’know, i just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
that is great. hey, y’know who does not have to job hunt? ross. he works at the university.
oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you are going to go out?
i just, phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.
yeah.
oh not-not so much. umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with ross?
are-are you saying he is a geek?
no! no i, no ross is not a geek!
what handsome is not your type? smart? kind? good kisser? what those things are not on your list? ross is a great guy! you would be lucky to be with him!
oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that is not what i meant.
yeah but, he is not your type.
yeah but, you do not, you do not, you do not want to try to much too fast. y’know? i mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast do not you?
she-she died jill.
hi!
well yeah…
really?!
oh so-so not really never.
hi! wh-what are you doing here?
well, i-i do not like it.
it is kind of slutty.
yeah well, I am-I am a slut.
rachel.
yeah i know, and i bet you thought it would be weird. but it is not!
why are not you home yet?!
oh yes, it is me! sorry!
uh, I am just, I am just looking out your window. at-at the view. what are you guys doing?
(gasps) oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
ugh, she is a slut!
oh my god, look-look he is taking off her clothes!
oh, this is just terrible.
oh. (squeaks again.)
yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
yeah!
what? you want to see me self-defend myself?! go over there (points) and pretend you are a sexual predator! go on! i dare ya!!
is not that a kind of sushi?
ohh! i would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
(to phoebe) ooh! y’know what? if we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
well, valentine’s day was like two weeks ago, so i would not get her a calendar!
aw, i love that.
(interrupting him) okay-okay-okay! so, making things. that sounds like so much fun.
hey, wait a minute! that is my sock!
what the hell was that?!
all right, so we were not prepared!
ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (she does the finger thing.)
yep!
oh, of course!
definitely! phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who is ass i cannot kick.
say it!
say it!
i do not like sitting up here! I am just going to over… (she starts to get up.)
oh my god! why is he jumping on those women!
i… well, i do not think they need any help.
(looking at the bill) uhh, we still need a tip.
a couple of bucks.
phoebe, i bet somebody is missing that badge.
hey joey!
(disgusted at ross's antics) ugh!
what?! you say that to kids?!!
ross, honey, it is a nice couch. it is not a magic couch.
wait! no, that is ridiculous. come on, he lives three blocks away!
yeah! (she puts on her coat and turns around and sees ross is expecting her to help.) (laughing.) are you kiddin'?
(disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. much to her amazement, she is successful.) oh. oh! i can do it!
ross!
ross!
come on, i do not really want to be doing this right now. i am carrying a very heavy couch.
(to ross) fine! (to the salesman) we went out.
ross!! oh my--ugh!! you kept count?! you are such a loser!
ross, did not you say that there was an elevator in here?
okay, y'know what? there is no more left, left!
yeah.
oh-oh!
any chance you think the couch looks good there?
(entering) hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
(noticing him) what is up joey?
hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch?
thanks!
i know.
what is up joe?
yeah?
(laughing) what are you saying?
y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i-i do not think we should be cranking anything up.
(laughs and pushes the chair back in) yeah, well, y'know umm… no honey, listen i think it is a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. do not hit on your existing friends!
yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it is so worth the wait.
(entering) hey ross! i brought reinforcements.
well, i brought the next best thing.
whoa-oh, what is-what is that? (points.)
wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself.
okay!
ross, i do not, i just do not think it is going to fit.
i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch!
hey! how is it going? did you make any new friends?
what?! why?!
oh my god, phoebe, are you going to go to jail?!
i cannot believe that you did not tell me that we are still married!!
when?! after the birth of our first secret child?! (to all) ross did not get the annulment; we are still married.
so, i still have boxes here. i still have boxes at ross’s, and i have nowhere to live! wow. i could so easily freak out right now.
well, maybe-maybe i could be your roommate pheebs.
well there is an idea!!
that would be great! wait, how long is denise gone for?
december 26th, huh maybe she is santa clause.
(deadpan) oh look who it is, my husband. the apple of my eye.
well sure, if you say you are going to take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you. give me those forms! (grabs them from him.) all right, now I am going to do this my way and i do not want to hear a peep out of you!
op! you are peeping!
ross! y’know what, i just got—why? why did you do this?!
i do not want to hear "three failed marriages!"
well, y’know what? thanks to you I am half way there! ugh! oh! i am so mad! ross, i do not think i have ever been this angry!
ugh! (stares at him.)
yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
uh yes, heroin and crack.
well, you would know.
(starts to cry) ross, please, i found the magazines!
ugh!
ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! (to the stenographer) and could you strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record?
well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think.
(stands up as well) what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
(to the judge) okay, do you see, do you see what you are keeping me married too?!
all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one!
and thank you for your time. (they both beat a hasty retreat.)
this is totally your fault!
well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!
do not call us that! (storms away)
(deadpan) oh honey thank god you are home, i was getting worried.
oh, little ‘x’s! great! that makes up for everything!
oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you!
nothing. (sits down.)
uh-hmm. (just as rachel finishes signing her name, ross yanks each page out of the way.)
okay ross, we are—wait a minute. umm, i uh, i kind of have a little confession.
well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kind of my idea.
well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
and uh, yeah, i did not really, i did not want to say anything, but it kind of it just, it kind of kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then (ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. so umm, sorry i got us into this mess.
yeah, do not push it though.
i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it would not be a secret, and we would not have our wedding dinner at pizza hut. (they both laugh.)
no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
hey, thanks ross, for taking care of all of this.
I am going to need a copy of those.
oh! good thing chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.
(entering) hey! umm, do you guys have any juice?
my boss, joanna? wow, that must have been awkward.
(laughs) you ah, you did not say ‘yes’ to that did you?
what is she doing here?
i do not understand! last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’
well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now!
chandler!! (he turns around quickly) promise me, you will end it.
thank you.
that is weird, she locked the door.
okay, swear you will not tell, but when mark left he gave me a key to joanna’s office. do you want to see the list?
(answering it) (angrily) what?!
you promised you would break up with her!
and the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
y'know what chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
oh, chandler!! all right, this is it! (grabs the key) you never see joanna again!
you never come into this office again!
you give me back my walkman!
well, then i lost it. you buy me one!
does it hurt?
wait a minute! what are you going to tell joanna?
when she sees that you are gone, she is going to know that i let you out, and that i was in here, and I am going to get fired!
no, there is nothing to make up, she is going to know that i have a key to her office, I have got to get you locked up back the way you were! (she tries to drag him over to the chair, but chandler stops her.)
chandler! chandler, please, i have to get you locked up back the way you were, i am sooo going to lose my job, she is very private about her office. now i know why.
what if i clean your bathroom for a month?
foot rubs for a month!
I will take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
sophie sit!!
no! god, would you just calm down!
i ah, will buy and wrap all of your christmas gifts.
i ah… oh! I will squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
(happily) yeah!!
d’oh!! (pause) I have got it!
i have so got it. there is going to be rumours about this, there is no way to stop it. sophie knows, monica and phoebe know.
oh, i called them. and when they ask me what i saw, i can be very generous (holds her hands far apart) or very (in a high pitched voice) stingy.
i can make you a legend. i can make you this generation’s milton berle.
ohh, not compared to you. (chandler nods in agreement)
so did you break up with joanna?
what?!
it is me! good morning!
yeah, sure. umm, they did not have poppy seed bagels, so i… (enters joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) oh my word!
oh, yeah! yeah!
okay.
(coming from the bathroom) hey pheebs?
I am having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you want to come?
oh no, no, I will be there too.
no phoebe! i just need you there for support. i have not told him I am pregnant yet.
‘because i know he is going to flip out and i hate it when he is angry.
what phoebe? wait! one time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he would make me eat the entire pack.
thank you.
(panicking) no you do not.
well you could have untied it with your hands.
well actually umm…
(to phoebe) in case you did not notice, that is a scary man.
this was such a huge mistake. i can not tell him phoebe. i can not, i can not, i can not, i can not…
no it is okay, this is what is going to happen. I am going to wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
hey, that is the…baby’s problem. (dr. green returns.) oh, everything okay with the waiter?
well… umm, i got tivo.
phoebe!
well uh, yes and no. except not no. so to sum it up, yeah.
no, it is ross. it is ross. you like ross. (he just shakes his head.) oh daddy, i hope you are okay with all of this. i mean think about it, this is a good thing. you are going to—this is your first grandchild! you are going to be a poppy!
yeah.
who?
february 2nd!
i know. i know. i panicked, i panicked. i did not want him to start yelling at me like i was some ’74 latour.
all right here he comes. I am going to do this, I am going to tell him, I am going to be strong.
yeah?
really?! the plaza?!! oh daddy!! (hugs him and phoebe glares at her.) right. daddy, i need to talk to you. please, sit down.
there is not going to be a wedding. ross and i are not getting married.
I am sorry daddy.
oh now daddy, stay calm. please.
yes. yes, he says I am damaged goods.
(quietly) oh no…
ross I am so sorry. okay. i-i will promise i will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
oh okay, I will fix that to. what is her e-mail address?
all right, i promise. I will fix this. i swear. I will-I will-I will-I will talk to her.
okay.
i know mona, just hear me out. first of all, I am so sorry about my father yelling at you, but i heard you totally held your own. you are going to have to tell me how you did that.
okay. um…but—okay, yes ross and i used to date. and yes we are going to have a baby. but we are definitely not getting back together.
oh we just—we drove each other crazy!
i mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
right! but, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. (rubbing his shoulder.)
i know, i get it, but mona, what relationship is not complicated? i mean we all have our baggage! you must too! why else would you still be single? (mona looks at her.) i am so going to leave right now. (ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
(entering) forgot my purse! (sees them kissing.) oh, you guys made up. (to mona) he is a good kisser is not he? (ross goes to close the door on her.) I am going! (quickly leaves and ross locks the door.)
about an hour ago.
yes! (she gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it up.) bye daddy. (phoebe and her leave.)
i am so proud of joey, i can not believe he is going to be on law & order!
no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
what is going on?
ross! we broke up two years ago; you have been married since then. i think it is okay that we see other people.
hm-mmm.
okay, y'know what? we do not need her measurements.
big night!
oh, umm, okay, yeah, I will be, yeah I will be right back. (goes to her room.)
(she enters and hands phoebe the earring) here you go. thank you!
oh what, you-you want both of them?
okay, okay, okay, look, just do not freak out, but i kind of lost it. i know it is in the apartment, but i definitely lost it.
tell her to wear her own earrings.
nooo! nooooo! you lent me monica's earrings?! I am not allowed to borrow her stuff!
because i lose her stuff!
oh boy, i just can not watch. it is too scary!
oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
but y'know, i never really had anything to worry about. ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
oh! y'know what? you are right! we meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
ohh! thank god! where was it?
okay that is the one we already have!
(smiling) what?!
(smiling) yeah.
(smiling) joey, why do not you just tell her what happened? it is not your fault.
it is not here pheebs, it is not here. ohh, i went to joey and chandler's last night! okay! (goes to the door.)
wait a minute. chandler has a jewelry box?
(entering) (to phoebe) (whispering) hey!
the earring? no. but look, i found my sunglasses under the couch! I have been looking for these since like last summer. (puts  them on.)
okay, calm down, here they are. (gives back the sunglasses.)
i do not know, i do not know.
oh gosh, she is going to kill me.
ohh that would be great!
okay, wait a minute. wait a minute, i-i-i, i can not do this. listen honey, this is, it is not phoebe's fault. she lent me the earrings, and i lost it. I am so sorry. honey, i feel terrible too. (holds out her arms for a hug.)
your sunglasses?!
honey, you have nothing to prove. and if you really like this girl, i do not flirting is the right thing to… (ross interrupts and shushes her.)
I am sorry.
okay, well, I am going to clear out some of these boxes. (she grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
hey! hey! (stops caitlin) hi! hey-hey-hey, I am rachel! from upstairs? the ones with all the pizza?
no. no. every thing's--they are fine. great pizza. but it is uh, actually umm my friend ross. he uh, just gets really nervous when he is flirting.
yeah.
i know, i know, but uh just, I am telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you want to die, he is-he is really a good person.
yeah. I am-I am telling you he is really sweet and he is really funny and he is just ugh, got a good heart. and besides, i y'know, i think he really likes you.
well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
(entering) hey ross? umm, i just ran into caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than i thought.
well, i do not get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
yeah!
i-i-i did not! i did not! she thought you were cute.
yay!
here you go pheebs. who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
phoebe, what? umm...what?!
and all these people actually died?
phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
i promise.
joey, you can not keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
whoa! wait! hello! what about me?
(holding ben) look benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) spoon. come on! all right, y'know what i think he is bored.
okay. okay honey, he is fine, he is fine, let us just put him down. come here, ben. (sets him on the couch) see that is a good boy. (to monica) how could you do that to him!! ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
we are not?!
all right, i like that.
so we are okay, we are okay, we are okay, (starts to exam ben) are not we? no, we are not okay, we are not okay, there is a bump, there is a bump.
i cannot push it in!
okay, okay, okay.
okay.
or. we could put a hat on his head.
we need a hat..
oh, oh, oh, I will get ‘rainy day bear’!! (runs to get him)
oh god, oh god, it is sowed on though.
okay.
oh, it is just like a bloodbath in here today.
right.
see pheebs, i promised you no one would die, did not i?
okay, i heard that.
uh-huh.
(goes over and hits her head on the post) look at that! (repeats) look at that! (repeats) we all do it. (repeats) okay, I am stopping now.
oh yeah! y'know, if it is not a headboard, it is just not worth it.
monica, number one, i do not think ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, i... (joey starts laughing in the background) (to joey) what?!
i also said number one.
hi!
he is perfect, he is never been better.
well maybe he is just taking a nap.
well, we have got to find out if he is alive.
are you, are you, are you sure it is ah, a new bump? i mean, no offense, I have always thought of ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
(confidently) i did!
i did!! i watched! i watched! i watched monica bang his head against that thing!
i hope it is still funny when you are in hell.
I will get the hat.
hey-hey, now he is showing us his poking device.
(checking her watch) op! we got to go! (the girls stand up.)
what ‘cha doing mon?
hey! those are all the things I am responsible for!
the commercial?
oh that is great!
oh, wait joey! we fought the nazis in world war ii, not world war i.
you are going to be late! go! go! (he runs out.)
mexico?
hi! oh you guys look so beautiful!
yeah! but i do not know what he looks like!
man in the black dress… (monica walks away and rachel looks around to find a woman in a black dress.) (to her) hi! I am rachel! I am a friend of monica and chandler’s!
oh i get it! a…man…duh!
I will do it.
i said I will do it!
monica! I am not going to screw it up!
well of course that is what I am here for!
ugh! (to phoebe) what grandmother?
hi!
she is steaming her dress, why? what is up?
what?!
(reading the note) tell monica I am sorry.
yeah but, maybe it is not what we think. maybe it is tell monica I am sorry i…drank the last of the milk.
okay. phoebe, i-i think ross is right. what are we going to do?
okay.
(closing the door) ross said there is still no word from chandler.
oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
god! do not—we can not let her start getting ready! this is too awful! oh god, but wait she will be in the gown and then he will not show up and then she is going to have to take off the gown…
I am sorry. I am sorry. it is just…it is just so sad!
i know. i know. oh god. (looking around) there is no tissue! can you grab me some toilet paper?
oh!
okay.
oh thank you! (wiping her nose.) oh god! (she throws it out.) can i have another one?
oh god i just can not imagine what is going to happen if chandler does not show up!
oh, i mean she is going to be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "oh that poor girl." y’know? then she will have to come back here and live all alone.
what?
oh my god!
oh my god!
no, she had to have just taken that test because i took out the trash last night.
okay phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
okay?
no. why?
anything?
all right, we have got to tell her he is gone. (starts to leave.)
ross, she is going to start getting ready soon!
all right, well how much time do you need?
one hour.
then why do you ask?!
all right, I will see you guys later.
I will figure something out.
thanks.
okay uh, but before you do that. i-i, i need you to talk to me.
umm… I am never going to getting married!
no monica! I am serious! oh, maybe i should just forget about it. become a lesbian or something.
well maybe it would make me feel better if i slept with joey.
the nights are the hardest. (checks her watch.) but then the day comes! and that is every bit as hard as the night. and then the night comes again…
i know. at dusk. that is such a hard time for me.
okay. but wait!
let us go to lunch.
right.
oh good god! I have fallen down! (she trips and falls.)
okay. all right. (gets up.) honey listen. when i tell you what I am about to tell you, i need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
we can not find chandler…(phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found chandler)—‘s vest. we can not find chandler’s vest.
oh!
you look so beautiful.
hello?
yeah, we got him back. everything’s fine.
what? why? where are you?
joey! the wedding is in less than an hour!
oh my god! I am going to have to find another minister.
ugh! joey, i have to go.
well phoebe, we got to do something! (they turn the corner.) well, y’know. i mean there is no way joey’s going to make it in time. so I am going to through the hotel and see if there is any other weddings going on.
okay.
anastassakis/papasifakis wedding, excellent! {it is a good thing jennifer aniston is greek, because she had to pronounce those names. luckily for me, they were written on a sign.}(the happy couple emerges.) congratulations. (to the best man and maid of honor) mazel tov! (the rabbi emerges.) hi! oh, great hat. (he is wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) listen umm, i need you to perform another wedding. can you do that?
yeah! yeah. they are…they are-they are my friends, uh, monica stephanopolus and uh, and chandler acidofolus.
(leaning in) as are you…
go on! go on. (she turns back to chandler.)
uh-huh.
yeah, so let us get started on the wedding plans!
yeah, we got a lot to do! we got to think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…
oh wait chandler, too many cooks…
okay.
aw.
what?! the duck?! what the hell did the damn duck do now?!
joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
what?!
now joey, what did the duck do?!
hey joey, what ‘cha doing?
no.
joey, did you my face cream?
joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?
(gasps) you found my book?!
joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
hey-hey, y’know what? i do not care! I am not ashamed of my book. there is nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. it is just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (she goes into her room.)
well what happened at dinner?
wait, but there is no money! well this is terrible! you guys are going to have to get married in like a, rec. center!
no, y’know what? it is going to be okay. i mean you do not have to have this rustic italian feast. y’know? and-and you do not need, you do not need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (she starts to cry, as does monica.)
do you even understand what off the rack means?!
well what?! how-how much is it?!
ohh! (whispers.) really?!
(starting to cry) ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
(quietly) joey.
uh-huh, i get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
well no, i do not smell anything.
nothing!
y’know, i can not believe you told him, joey!
uh-huh, yeah i did, because i wore out my first copy when i was with you. (exits.)
who are you supposed to be?
do you even know what a vicar is?
(sarcastically) yeah. look joey, it is enough all right?! you keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it is—I am not—it is just not funny anymore!
all right! y’know what? that is it! you want to do it?! let us do it!
(starting to move closer to him) that is right, i want to do it with you! I have been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
(moves the stool out of the way) yeah! ohh, I have been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
yeah that is right! come on joey; sex me up!
oh, come on now, do not keep me waiting. get those clothes off! but, i would keep that helmet on because you are in for a rough ride! (he backs into the door.)
(looking at her fingers) oh my…god! let me see that! (grabs the book from him.)
hi!
oh pheebs that is so sweet—(grabs a pair of pants)—ooh, those are so cute!
no.
wow! i do not remember him. honey, are you sure you are not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
oh that is nice.
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
(entering, carrying a baking dish) hi!
(sees will) oh my god monica, who is that?
oh! i do not remember him! wow! he is really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. (we see will angrily staring at rachel.) oh my god, he is… look at the way he is just staring at me. i think he is trying to mouth something to me, but i can not make it out. (will mouths, "i hate you.")
hi! will, right?
hi! I am rachel green.
really?! are not you sweet! i got to tell you though, i am, i am having the hardest time placing you. oh-oh hang on! did we umm, did we fool around at lance davis’ graduation party?
thank you!
all right, who would uh, like some yams? will?
what? (joey starts offering ross some turkey.) oh y’know what? can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? the smell is just yuck!
I am sorry. what?
umm, I am sorry. do you-do you have a problem with me?
I am-I am—i had no idea. I am sorry. i…
uh will umm, i just want to say that I am real sorry for whatever i-i did to you in high school…
you had a club?!
whoa! my god! so what, you all just joined together to hate me?! who else was in this club?
(to ross) so you were in an i hate rachel club?
so who else was in this club?
so ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an i hate rachel club.
okay monica, did you know about this?!
okay. so what? you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
what rumor?
ross!
what?!
(shocked) oh my god!
what?! you heard that?! (goes and stands behind joey.)
oh no!!!! oh my god!! this is all making so much sense to me now! this is why adam carter would not go out with me! this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region! (motions to her breasts.) (joey has turned around.)
monica, how come you never told me this?!
joey stop staring! there is nothing there! it is not true!
oh! (hits him and storms out.)
(entering carrying a book) okay! okay! listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "dear rach, you are such a good person." not girl! person!
(reading what he wrote again) "dear rach, you are a great person. sorry about your tiney-wienie." (will laughs.)
yes!
i do not care how long ago it was! you told people that i was half and half! y’know what? i just want to point out i never did anything to hurt you in high school.
what?
yes it is! i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
ohh, there is a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
wh—phoebe!!
all right, y’know—fine! you guys have your stupid little club, but i would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you! you gave me a tiney-wienie! (will laughs.)
wow…
she is right.
you can keep those pants by the way.
okay, chandler!
and your horoscope says, "on the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.
oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
(ecstatic) oh my god! it is joey tribbiani of mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.!!!!!!!
be-because the last one was such a big seller?
hey!
(to phoebe) we do?
okay.
hi, I am sorry I am late but i am ready, ready to talk you up! when does liz’s father get here?
oh! ross is sooo great!
(seeing him) oh hi!
oh! well let us look for them. (finds some under one of the couch cushions. it has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) oh-oh-hey! are these them?
all right! (throws them back under the cushion.)
oh good.
(chasing after him) oh, wait! sorry, mr. paul? mr. paul?
paul. umm, i just wanted you to know that ross really is a great guy.
you just do not look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
oh. we?
oh no! yes! of course, i know that! i just—i meant y’know are you still a ‘we’ or are you just ‘you?’
(sympathetic) ohh. so you raised her all on your own?
ohh. (she touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) ooh!
i was just getting him to like you.
ross, joey is not here.
ross, it is okay. you can come out.
bye!
well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…
no! downstairs! and we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and i really liked him so i invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
ross, what is the big deal? so i kissed the guy!
wh—you dated my sister!
what? why?!
ross look, look this is good for you. okay? let us face it, so far the guy’s not loving ya! but i can turn that around! i got the inside track! we can all go out to dinner, y’know? and i can talk you up! ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
oh it is important!
so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so ross selflessly, offered to take me.
wow! i definitely did not see that one backfiring! I am going to go to the bathroom.
oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), i mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
oh! whoops! I am sorry, you were talking about emily!
i mean if you think about it, i mean ross did learn something from each marriage.
now wait a minute that is not fair. he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily, he just did not tell me. (everyone looks at her, ross not happily.) maybe i have to pee again. (gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
(returning) wait-wait-wait, i just thought of another story about how nice ross is!
oh! I have got a lot of those too!
yeah.
hi...
rachel...
phoebe’s...
leave...
wait, i-i just said "leave."
phoebe, come on that is silly.
no, i have all of the good words. ok, fine, fine, we can switch.
okay.
everybody…
rachel…
phoebe’s…
what?
phoebe, come on can we finish this later? because i want to go running before it gets dark. oh! why do not you come with me?!
yeah, it will be fun. we will run in the park. it will be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
yeah and there is really cute guys there.
ok!
now wait a minute. you just took all the words!
okay. (runs off.)
you guys, I am telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between kermit the frog and the six million dollar man.
oh! i used to do that too!
aw, mon...(kisses her on the cheek)
yeah, yeah and you know what, i know she is going to want to run again, i just do not know how to get out of it, i mean, i live with her.
you are right, you are right. i should just tell her the truth.
pheebs, monica tripped me, i do not think i can ever run again, ever!
ankle.
no, no phoebe no, i was...no. you know what, i was, i was actually just checking to, see, if i could run. and i can!
no, wait phoebe.
hey phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?
okay, um, i...(phoebe walks into her room.) all right phoebe look, i just wanted to say that I am sorry. ok? i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you.
well, i-i should have told you the truth.
well, y'know, the reason i did not want to go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(starts flapping her arms)
well, it is embarrassing. people were looking at us like we were crazy.
because they are people.
yes, but still. they are people…with eyes.
i-i am not uptight—hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! listen, i am not uptight, man.
(runs into phoebe.) hey!
oh honey, I am so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
gone! i mean its amazing pheebs. i feel so free and so graceful. (turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) hey! look out for the horse! sorry! (runs off.)
phoebe?
look at that guy by the window, wow!
oh, what is wrong with me lately? i mean it is like every guy i see—i mean look here. (points behind them) look at that guy for example, i mean normally that is not someone i would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I am feeling, all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
yeah.
really?! so this has happened to you?
wow! this explains so much! last weekend, i went from store to store sitting on santa’s lap.
ah.
well, y’know what? i go see my doctor tomorrow, I will ask her about this. maybe she can give me a pill or something.
hi!
oh, okay. hey, can i ask you a question? was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? y’know who I am talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers… (stops when she realizes it was her.)
yes, you are.
oh, really, really good. but enough about me, come on! where-where are you from? what do you do?
right! right! i-i actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? do you ski? or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
oh, i love to ski! how amazing is this?!
no. I am very comfortable.
no! shoot, dr. schiff what kind of question is that?!
well would you like me to lie down on the table?
do you feel it too?
hi.
well, let us see. uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam i put my pinky in his chin dimple.
okay, even this is turning me on!
oh hey! hey ross! hey how is it, how is it going with you and mona? are you guys still together?
uh ross? you asked me that.
i think, if it was a little colder in here i could see your nipples through that sweater.
you gave her a key to your apartment?!
hey!
yeah. (they go into the kitchen.)
what?
phoebe no!
no! i do not care what my hormones are doing, i am not going to just do it with some random guy!
yes. hi, I would like to order a pizza. okay, can i ask you a question? is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? very ambercrombie & fitch. (joey enters.) I will call you back.
it is just the pizza place.
I am sorry honey, I am just having a, having a rough day.
oh you really, you really just do not want to hear about it.
okay, it is just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I am just finding myself…how do i put this umm, erotically charged.
yeah. so y’know, i have all of these feelings and i do not know what to do about them, because i can not date like a normal person, which is fine because i do not need a relationship, i mean all i really want is one great night. just sex, y’know? no strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that i feel comfortable with and who knows what he is doing. for just one great night, i mean is that really so…hard…to find. (looks at joey.) so how was your day?
well, i got to get up early and it is almost seven of the clock.
okay, good night!
(entering) i did not ask you to do it!
you are joey!
right back at ya!
and so bad. i do not even know what you are talking about because i did not ask you to do anything!
no!
that is the end of this conversation!
never happened! good night!
what?
yeah.
oh, sure! do you need me to train somebody new?
(to chandler) eh, do you believe that?
I am going to get back to retraining. (gets up)
gunther, gunther, please, I have worked here for two and a half years, i know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)
huh. well, y'know that is actually a really good idea, because that way they will be closer to the mugs. y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
gee, i always heard them talk about that, i just always thought that it was a club they went to. oh god, I am, I am sorry. (walks away)
(sitting down next to chandler) I am training to be better at a job that i hate, my life officially sucks.
well, yeah! I am still pursuing that.
well, I am also sending out.... good thoughts.
the fear?
well then how come you are still at a job that you hate, i mean why do not you quit and get ‘the fear’?
i do not know, i mean i would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... oh, i just do not want to be 30 and still work here.
yeah.
can not i just look at the handles on them?
okay, fine. gunther, y'know what, i am a terrible waitress, do you know why I am a terrible waitress? because, i do not care. i do not care. i do not care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, i do not care where the tray spot is, i just do not care, this is not what i want to do. so i do not think i should do it anymore. I am going to give you my weeks notice.
gunther, i quit.
(entering) okay, stop what you are doing, i need envelope stuffers, i need stamp lickers.....
hey-hey-hey that is funny! your funny chandler! your a funny guy! you want to know what else is really funny?!
i do not know, i do not know, were not you the guy that told me to quit my job when i had absolutely nothing else to do. ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!!
no, it is not going to be okay ross, tomorrow is my last day, and i do not have a lead. okay, y'know what, I am just going to, I am just going to call gunther and I am going to tell him, I am not quitting.
you and your stupid fear. i hate your fear. i would like to take you and your fear....
no.
oh my god! yes, i would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, joey.
thanks.
oh, i blew it. i would not of even hired me.
i can not! it is too late! terry already hired that girl over there. (points to her) look at her, she is even got waitress experience. last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.
(answering the phone) hello? (listens) yeah, this is she. (listens) oh! you are kidding! you are kidding! (listens) oh thank you! i love you!
(hanging up the phone) i got the job!
here we go. I am serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts humming the graduation theme) there you go. (hands it to chandler) enjoy. (they all cheer)
um, excuse me, everyone. ah, this is my last night working here, and i ah, just wanted say that i made some really good friends working here, and ah, it is just time to move on. (at the counter gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room) ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment i will never have to make coffee again.
oh my god! you look so beautiful!
i do the same thing.
I am just kidding too. (laughs) I am getting married in december. (turns away not happy with herself.)
oh y’know what? y’know what? now that you know what you want you should go to kleinman’s and get it half off. this place is so overpriced.
so, does this (the dress) come in another color or… (the store owner walks away.)
(to phoebe) so this is brooklyn.
okay.
oh they are pushing! they are pushing!!
well i…
no! you got to get me out of here phoebe! these bargain shoppers are crazy!
no! you got to hold my hand!!
(seeing who is trapped) hey…
you are out of diet coke.
you are out of toilet paper!
yeah, i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. and now I am not saying that there is any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that is why they got divorced.
well, what is the other reason?
well you have to because maybe it is stupid.
do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
hey! hey what is going on?
alright, i do not want to alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it is such a romantic place. that is all, i just wish i could (looks at joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.
not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler.
(looking out the window) what is with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
it is not the time charlie.
you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer.
ugh.
well, I have brought some books. we could read.
we can not. we are not pharmacists!
(picking up another random badge) kate miller?
and... that is the most sex I am going to have this weekend.
thank you. (they walk away)
i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
well, let us see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) no.
no, I am not blushing, I am sunburnt! from, you know, the rain.
no.
joey! (she walks away; joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
joey, come on! it does not matter, you know, it is not like anything's going to happen.
oh! (pause) ok. ok, you really want to know who it is?
do ya?
later! la...
ok. see you, bye.
(walking in hurriedly) open your drapes! open your drapes!
nooo!
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I am so jealous!
homo.
all right! well, uh... (to monica) we are going to hit the beach?
(to ross, in a flattering tone) it was really... great!
oh!
oh! weather bitch! (turns the tv off)
it is open! (joey walks in) hi, joe!
(worried) what, is everything ok?
nooooo, why?
(laughing) oh, that is crazy!
... yeah, it is true.
(pretending to be offended) what, hey!
w-what are you, what are you talking about?
ok... uh... maybe you are not always going after the wrong girl...
yeah, I am not talking about her...
you know? forget it!
no, i-i-i-i do not, i actually do not know who I am talking about! so!
yeah, sure!
(nearly whispering) ok, let us not make a big thing about this!
not working with me, joe! here is the thing: lately i have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!
only like a month!
what the... dial it down! (joey goes to sit on the bed) listen, ok, and maybe they are crazy thoughts, but sometimes i do, i have, I have been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at joey, who is totally distraught) ok, dial it up a little!
shoot!
i do not know, I am not trying to do anything, it is just, we have such a good time when we are together, you know... i mean, are not you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?...
(puzzled) who...?
oh yes, of course, i remember him!
yeah, he did! (smiling) oh, see, this is what I am talking about!
but can it... just... happen a little bit?
but why, why not?
but that was not going to stop you before!
(regretful) I am sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) oh god! i should not have said anything!
it is not a big deal!
it is so not a big deal!
ok!
ok, i...
aaahhhh!
what?
yeah. do not do this to yourself.
i know.
oh-oh, pottery barn! (grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to chandler.) you can throw the rest away.
monica look! look-look-look! here is that table that i ordered. (shows her the picture.)
yeah! it is an apothecary table. does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
phoebe hates pottery barn?!
well this has story behind it! i mean they had to ship it all the way from the white plains store.
okay fine! I will-I will just tell her it is an antique apothecary table, she does not have to know where it came from. oh! look at this little drawers! oh look-look it says that it holds 300 cds.
hey!
guess!
ha! see, i knew, i knew you would get it on the first guess. is not it cool! it is an apothecary table.
ohh, yes.
almost.
it was only 500 bucks.
oh, okay see i thought, i thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.
yeah no, i mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.
and fifty. so it was like one and fifty dollars.
yeah.
uh, it is from yore. like the days of yore. y’know?
yes! that i know, this is from white plains.
hey! we are here!
(seeing his new table) ohh! oh my god!
oh no!
ross! phoebe’s going to be here any second, she cannot see this!
i know you did! i bought the same one! and if she sees your table she is going to know that i lied to her. i told her ours was an original.
because she hates pottery barn.
i know! i know, she says it is all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (ross looks at his table.) so come on, she is going to be here any second! can we please just cover this up with something?! please?
ooo! oh, i forgot they made sheets!
ross, get over it! it is not like she hates you.
ross, she is not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
hey!
ooh, phoebe’s here! okay, let us turn out all the lights and we will just watch the movie!
he got it a flea market!
that is funny. (phoebe puts her feet up on ross’s table.)
ohh!!
noooooo!! (phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)
oh my god, phoebe, pottery barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
oh yes.
…see i can not decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the sahara desk, or the parker console table.
i know, i know. i went a little crazy.
hey.
oh it does, it does! it is a room separating apparatus from colonial times.
well there is yore. and uh, y’know, yesteryear.
oh honey he does not need my help.
(not sure of what to do) y’know what? i do not, i do not think phoebe really wants to come.
oh, she does want to.
pheebs, i do not know what to say. i guess the flea market was just better last time.
yeah.
yeah, y’know what? do not look at it. (realizes the display is their living room) seriously, do not look at it. (tries to pull phoebe away.)
ugh, those bastards! let us go.
no! no! no! no it is not! no it is not! come on! phoebe, ours is totally different! i mean we do not have the… (looks desperately for something different.) we do not have the…that lamp! and-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.
okay! okay-okay look—no i did, i just wanted this stuff and i know how you feel about pottery barn. just… come on do not be mad.
well then honey, buy the lamp! hey, we have that 60 bucks from ross.
what?! no! I am not going to move out!
(gets it) oh. yes! i would so move out!
that is right!
oh god monica hi! i just went to your building and you were not there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
hi, sure!
i knew.
i did.
yeah, maybe...
really?
oh ross, you are so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
okay.
ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind ross]
oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind ross] look at it!
all right, listen, missy. if you want this cart, you are going to have to take me with it!
(to ross) yes! did you see that?
i could not have done this without you.
(hurt) what?
hey, i was doing great before i found out about you. you think it is easy for me to see you with julie?
alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright ross.
because i do not need your stupid ship.
good. (ross leaves)
ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I am doing something i actually care about. this is the first time in my life I am doing something that I am actually good at. i mean. if you do not get that...
well neither do i!
(shocked) oh my god.
oh my god. i cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, ross, no, you are, you are, you are making this too hard.
i do not know, i do not know. urrrgh! look, maybe we should take a break.
no. (ross is standing in the doorway.) a break from us.
hi. ohhh, you got my message.
so what do you say? can i be your girlfriend again?
(opening the door) y'know what, i want you to leave! get outta here!
just get out! now!!
okay! all right! how was she?
was she good?
come on ross! you said you wanted to talk about it, let us talk about it!! how was she?
good different?
 ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you have grown. y'know?  i mean my mom never thought this would work out. it was all, “once a cheater, always a cheater.”  ooh, i just wish we had not lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
you seem to really like her.
ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through monica’s photo albums, i mean you do not do that if you are just in it for two weeks.
yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you are sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
yeah.
(entering) hey guys! what is up?
what is this? is this ross’s wedding invitation?
oh, no! no you guys! come on, you do not have to do that! I am happy for him! i am! i really—I am-I am happ—I will work on it.
yeah.
oh, honey, i do not know. i…
no, I will think about it. yeah.
who is this from?
oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) oh my god. he remembered.
it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can not believe he remembered!
what did you just say?
oh.... my god.
 (seeing ross come off the plane with another woman.) oh my god.
julie! julie, is not that great? i mean, is not that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
 she did not hang up either...
(on phone) ross, hi, it is rachel. I am just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I am really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...i am over you. i am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (she hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
oh my god. oh my god ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (she jumps the couch and lands on ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. ross has a confused expression on his face.)
ohhhhhhhh god. (climbs off his back)
ohh, ohh.
well, basically, lately, I have uh, I have uh, sort of had feelings for you.
really?
oh, god.
oh it is ok. you were worth the wait, and i do not just mean tonight.
ah, oh god. oh, honey, oh that is ok.
yeah, because i was mad at you, not because i stopped loving you!
noo.
noo! maybe! i, i do not know.
i just, i feel, i-i just...
y'know i can not believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
and hey! just so you know, it is not that common! it does not happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!
oh my god.
oh.
i can not go to my own prom without a date, i can not, it is too late.
yeah. it is just going to be too hard. y’know? i mean, it is ross. how can i watch him get married? y’know it is just, it is for the best, y’know it is, it is… y’know, plus, somebody is got to stay here with phoebe! y’know she is going to be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
i know. (starts to cry) yeah, see, there is so much to do and i have so little time to do it in.
excuse me, there was no time!
does anybody need more coffee?
(sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. hi. my friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh i ordered a rum and diet coke, which i do not think this is.
that is all right. (to her friends) i mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
ummm, i think it is time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)
yeah, i know.
oh, i do not know. well maybe it is just the idea of barry for the rest of my life. i do not know i think i feel like i need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (chandler is listening in very intensely)
I am serious, i really, i think i need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that i see.
yeah, so?
monica! look! hi! what do ya think? (shows her, her ring)
yes, his name is barry, he is a doctor, thank you very much.
thank you. so how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
oh, but that is okay.
yeah.
oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at chandler, who holds up the cue ball as a ‘remember me?’ thing) listen, can we please have lunch the next time I am in the city?
okay!
bye!
do not say anything. i do not want to speak, i do not want to think. i just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
what?
oh, sorry.
um, (shyly) barry.
hey look-look, phoebe’s talking to uh, cute coffeehouse guy.
hey, i thought that guy was married.
phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
oh, i got to get back to work.
yeah but, my assistant tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. ohh! i could just spread him on a cracker.
oh no, i know that. i know that. although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
i am not going to get fired, because I am not going to act on it.
why? is he? he is! is not he? he is dating that slut in marketing!
oh, no sit-ups today tag?
oh, well drop and give me ten more!
uh, i-i had a drink with lunch. did those cost reports come in?
oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
(startled) ahh, hi! hi! melissa, what is up? I am just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. y’know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. what is up? (she has put on the backpack.)
no. why?
really?! got a little crush on tag there do ya?
okay, whoa-whoa easy there melissa! this are not a locker room, okay? but, y’know i remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
oh yeah. all right, back to work.
yeah melissa, i do not want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but i will call your supervisor.
hi joey! what are you doing here?
yeah, sure. umm…here. (hands him one.)
yeah, i do not think so joe.
hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
how would you feel about taking out my assistant tag? I will pay.
I am not asking you to go on a date with him!
joey, just-just he-he is new in town and i know he does not have any guy friends. just take him to like a ball game or something. I will really appreciate it.
yeah?
yeah!
hi tag! hey, so did you have fun with uh, with joey last night?
ohh that is nice.
wo-women? you mean like old women?
(pause) oh.
that is great! wow man, so joey must have really taught you some stuff huh?
yeah?
(entering) hi!
so uh, heard you had some fun with tag last night.
yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all joey.
y’know, all the women.
all right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it is just—and i know he is my assistant and i can not date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!
all right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
i just do not want him to meet anybody until i am over my crush—and i will get over it. it is-it is not like i love him, it is just physical! but—i mean i get crushes like this all the time! i mean hell, i had a crush on you when i first met ya!
yeah. sure. (joey nods his head questioningly and rachel nods no.)
(to joey) so, will you talk to him?
oh, come on! I will give you ten free ralph lauren shirts.
hi! (he hands her, her mail) thanks, hey so uh what did you do last night?
oh yeah? another night of birdogging the chickas?
wow! i did not see that coming.
oh no, yes i do! i do! i mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying i am happier when uh, y’know?

sp-spoil?
uh-huh.
well, i-I am startin’ too.
yes! hell yes!
okay.
I would love to!
(panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it) hello?! (listens) oh, yeah! (to tag) this is going to be a while. excuse me. (tag leaves and she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) yeah!
well, joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since i do not have the guts to ask him out, I am going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
oh, here is that trench-coat that you wanted.
yeah?
(stopping him) oh no-no, no-no, they do not want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
well, that is because of a lot of…(she imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
i know!
oh?
well, congratulations, so do you love her?
huh. well, uh, that is uh, that is interesting. (she goes over and retrieves her note.)
oh, it is just an anti-theft device.
you need that, you need that too ‘because obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (rips up the note.)
oops, sorry. listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
we have to have a surprise bon voyage party for emily. but it is actually for joshua. (starts handing out party hats.) look, he said he is not ready to date, so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside of work, and now i have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (hands ross a party hat.)
surprise!!!
well, it was all ross’s idea.
uhh, because I am trying to play hard to get. oh, quick he is looking over here, say something funny.
okay, y’know what, y’know what? this playing hard to get thing is not working. umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (chandler does so.) okay. okay. (she does a little sexy walk over to where joshua is standing.) hi!
care for a cherry?
no? y’know, i can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
up!
yeah, i did. i needed my lucky dress.
ohh, god! look at him, he is so cute. i want to go over there, grab him, and kiss him! how can i kiss him and not letting him know that i like him?
what?
it is not christmas!
he is not 11!
what? you are leaving?!
no! you guys can not leave yet! you have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
(spinning the bottle) so, spin the bottle works like this: i spin the bottle, it lands on gunther, so i would have to kiss gunther. (she crawls over to where gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) all right. who wants to go first?
yay! emily!
okay, my turn!!
it is okay! it is okay! it kicked once, it will kick again!
all right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
just a bug.
no-n-n-n-no! i am finally thinking clearly. my lucky dress was not working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
hi!
ohh, yeah, well i wanted to give emily a big american good-bye cheer. so okay! (runs into the living room) ready! okay! give me an ‘e!’
give me an ‘m!’
give me an ‘i!’
give me an ‘l!’
give me a ‘y!’
what do you get? (she throws her pom-poms to joey and phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) emily!! (tries to do another one.) emil—whoa!! (she falls in chandler’s room.) okay! so that is me as a cheerleader! ta-dum! (gunther’s the only one that claps.)
I am fine! I am fine! I am just losing a tooth, it is no big deal. i have a dentist! y’know. I am going to go put some ice on it. excuse me. (she goes over to the ice and joey and monica follow her.) what do i do now? what do i do now?
all right, come on, let us go get your coat.
oh, yeah! real fun. (she makes a decision.) y’know, this bra… really, bothers me. (she starts taking off her bra.) y’know, this used to be my bedroom. yeah. a lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. if these walls could talk, y’know what they would say? want to hear some memories? (she is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it is not co-operating.)
oh no-no-no! no, i got this all under control.
ughhhh!! forget it! (sits down heavily on the bed.) this is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
can you not look at me when i say this? (he turns around) i thought that if i could get you here, i could seduce you.
well, I am sorry, i thought you needed them!
why?!
you like me?
yeah but-but-but you liked me! oh my god, i can not believe this, all this time, i liked you and you liked me!
oh no-no-no do not say but! no-no, but’s never good! let us just leave it at, you like me and i like you.
oh, now see that is a fancy but.
but….
okay.
ohh, here you are. i was looking for you before. joshua’s gone so you and emily are free to go.
oh, ross, I am sorry. i completely ruined your evening.
well, if it makes you feel any better, i made a fool out of myself.
is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
I am so sorry.
well, maybe you did not want it to end?
you seem to really like her.
ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through monica’s photo albums, i mean you do not do that if you are just in it for two weeks.
yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you are sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
yeah.
i do not know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
hey.
you are a pathetic loser, right?
sit!
oh my gosh, joshua!
they are not true?
oh.
oh! oh, i love that but.
you want to go inside and have some coffee?
okay. (joshua goes inside and to chandler.) every time.
yeah? well, you should know. you have bought like a billion of ‘them.
ohh…
(entering) hey!
are any of you guys free tonight? my boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people i bring, the better i look. so, monica? chandler?
oh my god, I am so sorry.
how about you guys? (points to phoebe and joey.)
i think so.
hey! ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
see? now, he could date her.
(breaking up) we are just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
oh! thank you!
uh well, uh this is a silent auction. they lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
(suddenly worried) uh, wh-why?
oh, hi!
someone? i brought people. mr. thompson, this is phoebe. phoebe, this is mr. thompson. (she introduces them.) he is the head of my department.
and i also brought my friend joey…
well, y’know i-i do not know where he is.
well, y’know what? actually, i was about to bid on this lovely trip to paris.
yeah.
thank you. (mr. thompson walks away and after he is left.) okay, (writing her bid down) twenty dollars.
ugh! so close!
what are you doing?
well now it is an empty bar.
what?! what?! what?!
joey! it is an auction! you do not guess, you buy!
joey! sit down! (pulls him down.)
what were you thinking?!
wh?!
why would a charity give away a free boat?!
ugh!
phoebe, do not you think you have had enough to drink?
how is you drinking helping the kids?
joey! joey, good one! (mr. thompson starts to laugh.)
(stopping him) hey! you…can not…leave joey! you agreed to buy that boat, all right?! that is a contract! and plus if you leave, my boss is going to kill me!
i know. okay. (whispering and thinking.) okay. okay. all right. all right, this is what we are going to do, we are going to go to the next highest bidder, and we are just going to let them buy it, and then you are just going to pay the difference.
okay.
not great.
oh great!
(to phoebe) why do you care about the guy who won the paris trip?
oh well, hello. this is your lucky day mr. bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and i believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
(to joey) okay. okay. (shushes him.)
ohh…
y-yeah! what-what is your wife’s name?
pam! oh god okay, just imagine this, "the pam."
okay, uh-uh imagine this, "the mr. bowmont."
okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (she sits down next to him.) all right, you are settin’ sail up the hudson! you have got the wind in your h—(sees that he is bald)—arms! you-you get all that peace and quiet that you have always wanted! you get back to nature! you can go fishin’! you can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you are old, cappy.
(to joey) what?! what?!
but joey you do not have $20,000!
(entering) hey! (sees monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) oh my god you are here, let me see your hand!!
is not it incredible?! monica and chandler, gettin’ married.
ohh… i mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
no! I am so happy for them!
I am so happy and not at all jealous.
i mean I am probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. and i mean what is 2%? that is nothing.
yeah me too.
(staring at him) wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, tennille.
we are going to find love!
yeah, I am pretty confident about that. that is what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler! it would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they are 40, they marry each other.
exactly!
you do?
who?
joey?!
are you serious?!
wh… so… if neither of you are married by the time you are 40, you are going to marry joey.
oh, seriously?
charming.
yeah.
hey you!
oh thank you. hey y’know, I am so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth.
yeah, love. it is a tricky business is not it?
so what do you say we make a pact? if you and i are both single by the time we are 40, we get married. i mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we have-we have already slept together so y’know there will be no surprises there! you know what i mean? no like, "what is that?!"
exactly.
what? who?
phoebe?! wait a—but-but she just, she said that joey was her backup.
ross! i just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and joey made a deal!
phoebe! you picked joey and ross?! you can not have two backups!
what?!
phoebe you can not have both of them! you have to pick one!
oh god, phoebe!
oh.
okay, y’know what?! i know-i know how to settle this! all right here, this is what we are going to do! I am going to write joey on one napkin (does so) and I am going to right ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! and that person is going to be our backup! okay?
pick one.
you are welcome.
(reading) joey! (pause) we should just switch.
ohhh, this is the least jealous I have ever been!
oh hell, he is done this three times! he knows what its about!
terry, i, i, i know that i have not worked here very long, but i was wondering, do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance in my salary?
it is so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family. see, every year we go skiing in vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but i sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why i took this job.
ok, i, i hear what you are sayin'. I am with you. um, but i, but I am trying really hard. and i think I am doing better. i really do. does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) oh, look at that.
excuse me, sir. hi, you come in here all time. i was just wondering, do you think there is a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
ok, ok, that is fine. fine. hey, I am sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) only $98.50 to go.
absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go.
yeah, well it was. i, i broke a cup.
no, not even close. forget vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
thanks, you can just put it on the table.
thanks, you can just put it on the table.
oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
thank you. thank you so much!
wait, wait, chandler, this is what you are having for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
oh my god.
saw what?
i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
ok, I am going to get my stuff.
ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) oh, sorry! oh, sorry!
i can not, i got to go.
ok.
i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
we are waiting for you to open the door. you got the keys.
yes, you do. when we left, you said, "got the keys."
no, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
oh, i got to get my ticket!
(grabs chandler by the shirt) all right, listen, smirky. if it was not for you and your stupid balloon, i would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. but I am not.
no, i did not. i would not say i had the keys unless i had the keys, and i obviously did not have the keys.
aside from the fact that you said you had them?
well, you should have.
because!
because!
oh, god, this is great! the plane is gone, so it looks like I am stuck here with you guys.
what?
by all means.
and a crappy new year.
(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but joey blocks her way) oh, sorry... oops, sorry.
ooh... oooh... (pause) (rachel is all bah-jiggity about joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to monica) can i ask you a question?
do you think it is possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
no reason.
yeah
(with high pitched voice) nobody, forget it!
(giggling and whispering) maybe.
(whispering) why? (monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") seriously i did not understand a word that you said.
yeah! you know, ever since i had that dream about him, and can not get it out of my head! and what is the big deal, people do it all the time!
ok, off the top of my head... don and janet.
i know them from work.
no, one of them...
i do not know, what were the names i just said?
all right, all right, you are right, i will not do anything with joey, i just thought that we (joey enters the hall) ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (joey enters his apartment)
hey!
yeah, it is a real shame you can not make it to that one-woman show tonight.
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)
(angry) you are having a party tonight??
and you were not going to tell us? how did you think you were going to get away with that?
you do that every year??
oh, that is why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
and last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
oh! and the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
joey, why would not you invite us to your parties?
well, then so you just invite me...!
oh, joey, come on! please, please! let me come, i will behave, i promise! i will behave! please, please, please...
(yelling and jumping like a child) oh, a soap opera roof party!! I am going to a soap opera roof party!! oh my god, oh my god!! (realizing how she is behaving) and it is out of my system!
(she enters wearing a bath-robe) hey... hi you guys! listen, you know what? I am not feeling really well. i think i can not get out for the play.
i do not know! i think it is kind of serious! oh, you know... i was watching this thing on tv this morning about... newcastle disease... and i think i might have it!!
... ok, who is this?
oh, hi! i would check your hand but... I am sure you do not want to get my chicken disease!
sure! (monica takes her apart) oh...
what? yes, i am!
when you are sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)
oh, no, no! i heard you before, that is so not what this is!
ok! (whispering) joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
and he did not want you guys to know about it but i came over here to tell you!!
ok professor or detective?
yeah, and he does it every year! that is why he is sending you to that play! that is why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
ok actually mon, matthew was just giving me his phone number.
nice to meet you.
ok
yeah!
yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly you have forgotten about chandler!
i always loved that!!
come on! i think this is funny! (ross leaves)
(drunken voice) i think i am.
(picking up the tissues) why, why, what is wrong with these guys?
joey, you are so sweet.
who (looks around)?
(surprised) what? (with a nervous smile) really?
oh! screw it, i did not get it! (they high-five)
oh, very funny... joey.
(to monica) hey!
i just wanted to let you know I have changed my mind: I am going to do it, I am going to kiss joey.
please, what about you and chandler?
well hello (points to herself)!
i could, i could but i do not want to! i want to kiss joey!
(pause) I am going to do it.
no.
hi!
what?!
(to monica) do you have to go?
thank you joey. you know what? I am not even sure i can have caffeine.
yeah. just to be sure I am going to call dr. wiener.
every time? (she takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)
all right, i trust you. (continues to dial)
I am on the phone! (on the phone) dr. wiener? (ross and rachel walk away)
(on the phone) excuse me? oh yeah? well, up yours too! (hangs up)
dr. wiener.
oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
yes, of course there is! okay? I am not insane!
hiccups.
yeah well, not anymore i can not. he fired us! what are we going to do? we have to find a pediatrician. wait wait, monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. what was his name?
argh! why does everything happen to me?!
what? what, do you mean you are not feeling well? what do you have? is it rubella? because do not go near emma, she has not had that shot.
(grabs the phone and stars dialing) (on phone) (in a high pitch voice) wiener, wiener (in a low pitch voice) wiener, wiener!!!
great! now he is going to know it was me!
it is impossible to find a good doctor. i mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are going to push their penis against your knee?
we have got to find a new pediatrician. ross was getting sick last night, and i think emma may have caught it.
ross said he died.
oh, great! well, then I am going to take emma to see him. i wonder why ross said that he died.
why? what was it?
hi, my name is rachel green, i have an appointment for emma.
oh, i really liked him. (looks at ross) yeah, it was really, really, really good.
i know. (pause) ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (to ross) i do not care!
ross, seriously! you have got to go to an appropriate doctor.
okay, wow, wow, wow. watch the tongue people, we have got a baby over here.
bye honey. (they hug)
my god, get a room!
oh god. what about you, joe? what would you give up, sex or food?
no, you got to pick one!
you got to see these latest pictures of emma.
yeah.
oh, no, no. that is a doll.
oh. who is the blonde, she is pretty.
he is not having an affair!
no, you are not! last week you thought ross was trying to kill you!
oh, that does not mean anything.
(whispering) "dude, where is my car?"
they are in a caaar...
geez!
oh, yeah, ok. let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
I am telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
oh, look at her, so happy!
phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester.
who is nancy?
are you serious?
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I am doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker is doing it!
yeah it is.
well, it is, all right? when we were out there today, all i kept thinking was: i can not believe chandler is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice place to live!
(talking on the phone) c'mon daddy, listen to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you are a shoe! you are a shoe, you are a shoe, you are a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i do not want to be a shoe? what if i want to be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i do not want you to buy me a hat, I am saying that i am a ha- it is a metaphor, daddy!
well maybe I will just stay here with monica.
you are fly is open, geller!
ow, that had to hurt!
no mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. i want to do this.
oooohh that is interesting.
14?
space cowboy!
ow...oh gosh!
oh-oh-oh, he is a transponce—transpondster!
y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
that is not true. she did! she forced me!
well it stupid, unfair question!
(running from the guy's apartment with joey in tow) hey, what is-what is going on?!
funny, because i was just going to go across the hall and write that on chandler.
well, phoebe that is fine because I am not moving.
yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.
well y’know, i do not want you to be cold.
and a crappy new year.
you can not move. you just... you just can not.
yeah. so do not move, okay? just stay here and... (nods towards ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
yeah, we are going to let you be alone.
aah! why? what are these for?
ooh! oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
oh my god. ok you guys, there is danny. watch. just watch this. (he walks past the couch to the counter.) see?! still pretending he is not interested. ohh, he is coming over. just pretend like we do not know him. we have forgotten who he is.
thanks, mon.
monica!!!
(somewhat angrily) okay. what the hell was that? you know what? do not answer me. (giggling) i have a date with danny.
i just saw danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
well, you should be, this is all your fault! you meddled in our relationship!!
no, but i was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
she was kind of stupid. you are right. all right, I am just going to go on the date. I am going to go on the date. that is the new plan.
so did i. I am really glad monica asked us out.
you are sister? you are sister's asleep on the couch? (danny nods, "yes.") ohhh! i saw her with you on the subway and now she is asleep on the couch!
hi!
(not sure what to do) uh, it was very nice meeting you. (they continue to ignore her.)
(entering from her room) hey!
hey, umm, can i ask you guys something?
uh, i do not have any brothers so i do not know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
well, i met danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. but, i guess that is normal?
okay, y'know what uh, actually, that is great. that helps a lot. thanks. (she leaves them to wrestle.)
oh, great!
okay, see? i told you!
yeah uh, y'know what uh, let us skip it.
umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…
well, okay, look. i do not know, listen, i do not know what is going on here but let us…
no, i have two sisters. but one of them has a very masculine energy.
no-no, they are not very nice people.
well, uh, i-i do not know. see when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…
yeah, okay, I will see you later. (gets up and runs from the apartment.)
I am doing just fine! god, tiffany, you smell so great!
oh, y'know joey, you are sick!
I am not reading this!
that is a good story, grandpa.
so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
well, i used to date him, but you are still going out with her!
yeah, but she also invited you and ross. yeah, honey, I am sorry, but i do not think that was a romantic thing.
well, that is a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
okay, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet.
we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
do not worry, we are just going to search here for an hour, them we are going to go over to joey’s and search, ok?
chandler, are not you worried about what to get monica for christmas?
chandler, that is not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you have just gotten her one great present? i mean that is just going to make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?
that is right!
oh, it is a macy’s bag!
(reading) dear losers, do you really think I would hide presents under the couch? p.s. chandler, i knew they would break you.
we are so going to find them this year.
yeah.
yeah, we found them. there were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
well chandler, what is this very weird, metal a z thing?
ha!
yes, okay, oh, by the way, i just got to say, i think it is really nice of you that even after you have moved, you still keep storing that stuff for joey!
hey, this is hollow.
this bench, it is hollow! i can not believe i never knew that! (she pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) oh, the presents!!!
oh, this one’s for me!
ooh, let us open them!
whatever linus, I am opening mine.
uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
‘cos i was going to say there is no way you could have done the end the way you guys did it back then!
see, there is always one guy. (mocking) "if i had a wish, I would wish for three more wishes." (joey enters.)
look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! look at the window, there is my name! hi, me!
god, is not this exciting? i earned this. i wiped tables for it, i steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens envelope)—not worth it. who is fica? why is he getting all my money? i mean, what- chandler, look at that.
oh my god! (rachel, leslie, kiki, and joanne all scream and hug each other.
what are you guys doing here?
(to a pregnant leslie) look at you, you are so big i can not believe it!
(to joanne) so what is going on with you?
so c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
okay.
what? guys, I am not.
I am not! this is what I am doing now. I have got this job-
okay, I am not just waitressing. I am.. i, um... i write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and i, uh... i take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... oh, and, um, sometimes artelle let us me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
what is that?
okay. (grabs the blender and starts to drink.)
oh, god, ask them what they want.
but i have not used my card in weeks!
they want to know if I am okay. okay.. they want to know if I am okay, okay, let us see. well, let us see, the fica guys took all my money, everyone i know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I am getting coffee! and it is not even for me! so if that sounds like I am okay, okay, then you can tell them I am okay, okay?
alright, c'mon! (miserably) let us play twister!
monica, what is so amazing? i gave up, like, everything. and for what?
...jack from downstairs?
okay, but pheebs, pheebs, jack gave up a cow, i gave up an orthodontist. okay, i-i-i know, i know i did not love him-
but see, it was a plan. y'know, it was clear. it was figured out, and now everything's just kind of like...
yeah.
okay, but monica, what if- what if it does not come together?
okay, see, see, you guys, what if we do not get magic beans? i mean, what if all we have got are.. beans?
I am so sorry, you guys. i did not mean to bring you down.
thank god. food. (she goes to answer the door.)
(miserably) no, no, that is not what we ordered... we ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
uh, pheebs? who is george snuffalopagus?
hello? who are we spying on?
oh, him, the little guy? oh, i love him!
yeah.
oh please, they are having sex.
so, whaddya think george is like?
how long?
okay, okay, okay, i got one! (she sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) anyway- the valentine tommy rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
hello? like he was really going to send you one? (to phoebe) she was a big girl.
i was laughing! you made me laugh! (monica and rachel start to squabble)
he is so cute!
oh, okay. will you take my place?
nooo! (she grabs the phone and chandler takes her place on the mat.) (on phone) hello? (listens) oh, yeah, no, i know, i-i have not been using it much. (listens) oh, well, thanks, but, I am okay, really.
(on phone) I have got magic beans. (listens) never-never mind.
(on phone) ohhh... I am fine.
yeah pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. i doubt she is even had time to…
(to monica) yeah, you are on your own.
okay.
hey!
(quietly) oh, thanks.
i do not know, y’know? i feel a little umm… no, y’know what? nevermind, I am going to be fine.
hi!
well thank you, you too.
hey, do you believe this? do you believe they are actually getting married?
ohh…
yeah, i guess. i-i… i mean, do-do you think we are ever going to have that?
oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! we, you with someone and me with someone.
shake it off.
no, absolutely. y’know like it was umm…
yeah, just give me a minute! (thinking) oh well, yes, i can think of one good thing.
well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, i really liked your hands.
yeah.
uh-huh.
oh, i know. hey, y’know what we never did? (ross looks at her.) oh no, not that. (ross nods okay.) we uh, we never had bonus night!
y’know, bonus night. y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
yeah-yeah, we never had that,
what?
oh honey, but it is just about…
what?!
yeah. no. and you know what? nobody even saw!
honey i swear it we just kissed.
okay come on phoebe, it is nothing! monica, come on!
no!
no-no, it is really not huge.
joey, you are not! you are 31.
honey, monica, this is ridiculous! look…
hey.
what do you think monica mean when she said she did not want to talk, especially with me? i mean, why not especially you and me? we were both out there kissing.
come on! serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (mimicking monica.) especially you!
i care!
y’know what, i-i have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
am i going to let you watch me undress?
monica, what did you mean before when you said you did not want to talk to anyone, especially me?
no-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
what?!
monica, what are you talking about?
monica, y’know what? the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring!
oh!!
monica, your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago.
ugh, monica i do not want to steal your stupid thunder!
all right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it are not going to happen!
i swear, i never wanted any part of your night!
(ignoring them) monica, why? why would i ever want to take away from your night?
oh wow. that—y’know what? that is so unfair. y’know what? now i want to steal your thunder! come on ross, let us go have sex!
we are not going to do this, all right? she is just going to think that we are doing it.
who is it?
okay well ross! stop it please! wait a minute! (motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. so she pokes him.)
yeah, you like that baby? (monica bursts in followed by chandler.) may we help you?
all right monica, do you want to know why i was with ross tonight?!
no you do not know why!
because! because i was sad.
look, i am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I am not. I am not even close. and i do not know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that that is dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler!
anyway sweetie, i am, I am so sorry i ruined your night.
yeah.
please tell me you are not going to dress up like a dinosaur.
hi!
i am! i am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she will not be able to fit into it.
ahh!
okay.
oh! oh! can i give out the candy? i really want to be with the kids right now. y’know, ever since i got pregnant i-i have the strongest maternal instincts.
(to them) just a minute!!! (she takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) look at you guys! wow! you are a very scary witch. (gives her candy.)
and you are a very funny clown. (gives him candy.)
(to the cowgirl) and you are so in style right now. y’know, i work at ralph lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. i do not suppose you saw the cover of british vogue, but…
yeah. sure. (throws some in her bag and she walks away as phoebe, dressed as supergirl walks up and eyes monica who eyes her back.)
(to monica) oh, you did this to him?
oh! (opens the door to reveal a ballerina) well you are just the prettiest ballerina I have ever seen.
oh wow! that deserves another piece of candy.
well, i have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
ohh… oh, honey here. take it all. (pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) monica! we need more candy?
yeah i know, but one of them just said that she loved me so i just gave her everything.
hey.
hi! y’know what honey, we are actually out of candy right now. but someone just went out to get some and i have been giving out money but I am out of that too. hey, can i write you a check?
okay, what is your name?
okay, I am just going to write this out to cash.
hey mona!
oh gunther! you brought candy! thank you so much for picking this up! you are so sweet.
honey, someday you are going to make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
got to go! (opens the door to a boy in a cape.) hi! wow! there you go! (hands him some candy.)
oh yeah, we were but umm, now we have got candy.
well, that-that is not your choice. happy halloween!
well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and i got to give you free stuff?
you shut up!
uh, i think i just did. and uh-oh, here it comes again. shut up!
(to joey) yeah i know—I am good—i got it! (joey slowly backs away.) (to the boy) now wait a minute, I have got one more thing i have to say to you…oh right! shut up!
no! wait no! shut up—i mean do not cry! let me get my checkbook! (grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
hey! well, i had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
no, i also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. oh, i am just awful with children!
really? you think that is all it is?
well, my eye is a little itchy.
richard? I am not going to go see your ex-boyfriend!
well, I am sorry I am not going to an eye doctor!
(flinches) ross! come on! that is all right! fine--okay, i have a weird thing about my eye. can we not talk about it please?
(flinches again) monica! come on!
(freaks) ross! stop it! come on!
chandler!
just stop it! come on!
(entering from her bedroom) all right! let us get this over with! ugh! (she walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) ohhh! no! look what i did! (she starts walking through the mess. {also, notice the continuity error in this scene. note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) oh, i mean, look at this mess! i mean, we are probably going to have to clean this up! y'know? we are going to have to reschedule!
oh my god! what does that thing do?
all right, I am outta here!
hey!
so were done then!
okay.
uh-huh.

(jerks back from the tester) what?!
all right.
I am sorry. all right, I will just stay in here this time. (puts her head back.) okay.
uh-huh.
okay.
okay. okay!
(really excited) great!! it was very, very nice to meet you sir--ow! hey! what are you doing?! are you crazy! (he took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)
yeah, no, i do not-i do not put things in my eye.
great!
okay, just give me the damn drops! (grabs them and storms out.)
y'know, i-i got to tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. my eye is a 100% better.
damn!
bye you guys!
oh honey, I will say good-bye to you at the car if you do not mind the puss.
well, wait a minute! the puss is good! it means it is healing! (runs after him.)
oh, did you beat him at a board game? he turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
eh! stop it!
okay. (she tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. the only problem is, it is not over her eye.)
okay, then y'know what? help me! i need help! i can not do this!
all right!
all right.
yes!
okay.
okay, they are. (no they are not.)
(thinks) four.
really?!
okay!
great!
okay.
well, well, you said it was practice!
because i knew you were lying!
(as she is being dragged) what are you? monica!! stop it!! oh my god! stop it! (monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
oh my god! you really are freakishly strong!
monica! stop it!
wow, y'know if joey and chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (monica is straddling rachel and holding her arms down. in a rather risqu� pose, at least for primetime tv.)
yep!
what?!! stop it! stop it! oh my god!
oh! (she is trying to recover while still on the floor.)
yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
huh. well, then you would better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that?
oh, honey, that is so sweet.
oh my god! what happened?
yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
and not one of your coupons for an hour of "joey love."
no! I am sorry, honey, it is just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help.
hey, how did it go?
you know what we should all do? go see a musical.
and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one?
no....
yes! rent!
what? oh, I am sorry, i can not, I am busy.
what did you get her? (joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)
okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it is just not something a boyfriend gives?
any luck?
all right, look. why do not you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen.
aw, honey, that is so sweet.
oh! pathetic! (grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)
i did it! oh! i finished it! i did it all by myself! and there is nobody to hug!
hey! hey, you guys, i finished the crossword all by myself! hug me!
thanks!
thank you! hey, how did the catering go?
oh, that is so sick.
y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. he took me to lunch at the russian tea room, and i had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
then we took a walk down to bendall's, and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel...
right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? it was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
yeah, but it was different with him today! and he was not, like, orthodontist guy, y'know? i mean, we had fun! is there anything wrong with that?
why?
all right. all right, all right, all right, all right, i know it is stupid! i will go see him this afternoon, and i will just put an end to it!
wow... wow!
I am not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that.
ooh, and it is so nice having this little sink here...
oh, it is just... oh, barry, this was not good.
well, what about mindy?
no, not that, i mean, what about you and mindy?
no. no-no-no-no, no. i mean, do not do that. not, i mean not for me.
oh, barry..! come on, this is all way too..
i had a bra.
what?!
pretty well, actually... (wandering into the kitchen.)
oh, do i?
(in a low voice) we ended up having sex in his chair.
i do not know! i mean, we still care about each other. there is a history there. 's'like you and carol.
please. if she said to you, "ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
(on phone) hello?(listens) mindy! hi! hey, how are you? (listens) yes, yes, I have heard, congratulations, that is so great. (listens) really? (listens) oh. (listens) okay. okay, well I am working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (listens) okay... (listens) great... (listens) great... (listens) all right, so I will, so I will see you tomorrow! (listens) okay.. (listens) okay... (listens) bye. (hangs up and sits down heavily.) oh god. oh god. oh god.
oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...oh, she sounded really weird, i got to call barry... (does so, on phone) hi, it is me, i just.. mindy!! mindy! hi! no, i figured that is where you would be!
get down?
thanks, but i got to go to work and get my eyes scratched out by mindy.
please. i have not heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? i mean, what else is it about? oh! she was my best friend, you guys! we went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
and now, y'know, I am like... I am like the other woman! i feel so..
right, I will see you guys later...
mindy.
hey, you.... so, what is up?
sure we should... so.
okay.
of course!
was that all you wanted to ask me?
ohhhh!! (mindy starts to sob.) ...what? what?
oh sure it is!
um, what- what would make you think that?
(draws back) really. mindy, if it will make you feel any better, when i was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
what? what is what you were afraid of?
what?
uh... oh, mindy, you are so stupid. oh, we are both so stupid.
(offers her arm to mindy and she sniffs) smell familiar?
oh, i am so sorry.
hey. got a second?
uh, we are here to break up with you.
uh- which one of us are you talking to there, barr?
even when we were having sex in that chair?
please! during that second time you could not have picked her out of a lineup!
well, the first time did not really count... i mean, y'know, 's'barry.
okay. okay, we will be here! hating you! did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? listen honey, if I am hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I am telling you, this feels great.
what are you talking about?! mindy, the guy is the devil! he is satan in a smock!
oh god.
and i hope barry does not kill you and eat you in aruba.
yeah.
yeah! y'know, ever since i ran out on barry at the wedding, i have wondered whether i made the right choice. and now i know.
you do not know?!
(entering) hi!
hey pheebs, can i talk to you over here for a second?
(laughs) well okay—well do not ruin it! just play along at least!
(to phoebe) oh my god! we have to throw her a shower?!
she has got so much going on we-we have only two options. we have friday…
yesterday!
oh my god phoebe, this is impossible! we can not do this by friday! we have to find a place. we have to invite people! we have to get food! there is just too much to do! it is impossible! we can not do it! we cannot do it! we cannot do it!
(calmly) okay. I am sorry. you are right, you are right.
phoebe, i already, i already did.
okay. okay. (they sit down.) i think we can do this if we just get organized. all right? we have two days to plan this party. we just need to make fast decisions! okay? all right, where are we going to have it?
4 of the clock. food?
ooh great! very monica.
ah you went one too far. uh, flowers or balloons?
we are paying for this y’know.
okay. umm, what should we do for the theme?
(pause) what?
okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still do not have a guest list.
hey! what is up mon?
have at it.
are you makin’ him a sandwich?
(to phoebe, after monica’s gone) we have to get her a present?!
oh my god you are amazing! did you just pull that out of her purse?
yeah?
well, i do not know. i called all the people in monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
(to her) hi! I am rachel. this is phoebe. I am the maid of honor. how do you know monica?
ohhhh!
that is great!
(to the woman) excuse us for a minute. (they go into the kitchen.) you did not tell her to come?!
no i was not! you were supposed to tell her to come and i was supposed to bring the cake!
yes! and please tell her to bring a cake!
oh monica, we are so sorry.
well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you do not have either.
ugh…
what do you, what do you mean?
surprise…
…monica.
noo way, kevin.
ross, you are so pathetic. why can not your son just play with his doll? (uses the milk master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)
what is the big deal? why do not you want to see janice?
men are unbelievable.
amazingly, that makes sense.
sure pheebs, you know, that is what it is there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
very nice touch.
unbelievable.
honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)
okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it is not so bad. how did you leave it?
yeah, well that is that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. we sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
yeah, you do.
this is a very critical time right now. if you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. you want her back you have to start acting aloof.
right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof.
oooh, honey, you are not a total loser.
oh.
g.i. joe? do you really think he is going to fall for that?
yeah, it is.
shhh...i do not know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
yeah.
yes, and grumpy.
he is soo lucky, if janice were a guy, she would be sleeping with somebody else by now.
yeah.
oh, monica made me send her to my mother's. apparently babies and weddings do not mix.
uh... november?
hey pheebs...
uhm... you have not told these guys what they are doing in the wedding yet.
well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) oh, and i can leave!
(excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) goody, what is it!
what, what, what, no, i do not want to do that.
happy wedding day!
ok-dokey, joey, listen. this is going to be bridesmaid central, all right? we are going to have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, i had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
what d'you want?
oh, ross, c'mon, please! do not make this harder than it already is!
well, chandler said that it is really important to him too!
oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
hi
even so, i think I am going to pick ross.
all right fine, i pick you.
(not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) oh my...
well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
who is there?
uh.
you know what, i can not do this. i do not know which one of you guys to pick.
(sarcastic) wow, this is a tough one. i think I am going to have to go with the dog.
since when do you watch the news?
wow, you know, it is so beautiful out there. you always wanted to get married outside. why do not you guys just do it on the street?
well, look, it is hardly snowing anymore. i mean you could not ask for a more romantic setting. this could be the simple wedding you have always wanted!
oh phoebe, I am so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
geez ross, you could have showered.
what the hell is that?!! (to monica) what the hell is that? is that you? (monica nods her head no, and rachel realizes what is making that sound.) ohhhhhhh! (storms over to chandler and joey’s with monica in trail.)
(angrily) back off!!! (she starts banging on their door.) get up! get up! get up! god damn it! get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
what is that noise?
well, I have been up since six. thanks to somebody is dumb-ass rooster.
yeah! especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
what?
I am so not impressed. everybody snacks when they shop.
how many guesses do you get?
no! there is no orange juice in there! we win!!
okay, well, we won that one.
yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
fine! we will ask phoebe.
i know! i know, it is such a huge, life-altering thing.
tails!
we will take literature!!
chandler gets it! it is chandler bing!
(shouting) it is all relative!!
(shouting) I am sorry!
monica, i do not want to lose 200 dollars.
monica?!
okay, so let us play for some pepper! stop spending my money!
oooohh that is interesting.
throw in the duck too!
well, he gets the other one all riled up.
monica, betting the apartment, i do not know about this.
why? do you have the answers written on there?
all right, let us do it.
okay. (they go into the living room.)
all right!
14?
space cowboy!
oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers.
he carries a briefcase.
oh-oh-oh, he is a transponce—transpondster!
oh my god.
(entering from chandler’s bedroom, i guess, and sees the foosball table.) oh my god! i can not believe you guys are actually think you are moving in here!
well i-i-I am not moving.
no, it was a stupid bet! we were just playing a game!
noooo.
what?!
i do not care, I am not going anywhere.
no! put that box down! we are not going anywhere! this is my apartment and i like it! this is a girl’s apartment! that is a boy’s apartment, it is dirty and it smells. this is pretty. it is-it is so pretty! and look, and it is-it is purple! and I am telling you, you with the steady hand, i am not moving, and now i have got the steady hand. (she holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)
that is right! you do what the hand says!
how did it go?
y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
that is not true. she did! she forced me!
well it stupid, unfair question!
will you stop calling it your apartment!
no it is not!
oh, i think i saw some in here.
i do not know! but maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it will die.
oh my god! this is it! (she and phoebe hold hands.) (to phoebe) i really hope it is you!
me too!
okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! who is it?!
hypothetically!
uh-hmm.
yeah that is actually a pretty good idea.
well of course we will help you decide! we will do anything we can to help you! now, i would like to make a toast, to the future mrs. chandler bing (a woman at the table behind them overhears chandler’s name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…
fine!
yeah?
really?!
oh my god phoebe! i mean I am just—wait a minute. if I am your maid of honor that means you are monica’s.
ohh! no way phoebe! i want to be monica’s!
why does it matter so much to you?!
what-what if i marry ross—or joey?
yeah but phoebe…
okay. okay. it is—since you have never done it before you can be monica’s made of honor.
I am going to marry someone good y’know.
better than chandler. (phoebe exhales as if to say, "like what is not?")
phoebe is going to be monica’s maid of honor!
(shocked) you have been maid of honor before?!!
all right that is it! i am maid of honor!
how come you are?!
oh, come on! this is crazy! can not we just flip a coin?!
okay. okay fine, y’know what? we will let ross and joey decide. (ross enters.) (in a sexy voice.) hiiiii, ross! sweetie.
okay, uh…
…it is going to be okay!
look monica, getting cold feet is very common. y’know, it is-it is just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. and also, i ran out on a wedding. you do not get to keep the gifts.
thanks!
thank you judges.
oh!
wait a minute! she just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
ohh, wait a minute, we have not pre…
okay! okay! umm, webster’s dictionary defines marriage as… (ross and joey start writing.) okay!! forget that! that sucks!! okay, never mind! forget it! umm, umm, okay, uh… i met, i-i met, i met monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and i became friends with chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
thank you. thank you very much. umm, I have known them separately and I have known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass (grabs a glass and holds it up) to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
aw, thanks!
what?!
well then i demand a recount! (hmm, i wonder where I have heard that before.)
no! y’know what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—we are going to flip a coin! (phoebe gasps.) all right?! (she flips the coin.) heads! (looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
well y’know what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (runs out.)
hi pheebs.
hi! i just want to apologize. I am really sorry i was a baby.
yeah. yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. and-and y’know i was thinking about it, if-if you are monica’s maid of honor that means i get to be yours.
yeah! oh, umm when-when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves. and-and ohh god this is funny, look, this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (shows phoebe the picture.) and look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because i was wonder woman. oh and here is a little purse that i found. (hands her the purse) y’know i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
and umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘because, people cry at weddings. (starting to cry.) I am just going to grab a couple of these.
oh, i forgot this was in here. umm, this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monica’s something borrowed and it is blue. (starts to cry again.) yeah…
you do? why?
but pheebs, y’know you earned it.
no, i was ten. i just developed early.
hey!
yeah okay, you laugh now, but she is going to be yours. (phoebe gets suddenly scared.)
(answering her phone at work) hello.
oh, hi.
well, there was a disaster in shipping and I have got to get this order in. honey, I am so sorry, but it looks like I am going to be here all night.
no-no-no, no, honey please, I have got, I have just have so much to deal with.
(on the phone) no, no, no, I am looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. and.... (listens) what does it matter, what I am wearing?! can i please speak to your supervisor? (listens) thank you. (to sophie) we are holding.
(startled) oh!! my god, what are you doing here?
ross honey, this is very nice, but, but i-i got a crisis.
honey, honey, I am sorry, i know it is our anniversary but i told you on the phone i do not have time to stop.
but i do not, hmm... (on phone) oh, who approved that order?! (listens) well there is no mark robbinson in this office. (to sophie) get me mark on the phone!
well, let me just check that with what i got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is atlanta. and i...(stops and looks at ross)
(angrily) none for me.
I am sorry, as i was saying the store number is wrong, and I am sorry but that is... (notices a fire that ross’s candle has started) oh my god!!
(on phone) excuse me, I am sorry, I am going to have to call you back, I have got a schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to ross) what are you doing?
ross you are not listening to me, i do not have time to stop.
i do not have ten minutes!!
hey, ross!!! i told you i do not!
look, i cannot do this right now, okay, I have got a deadline, would you just go home, I will talk to you later. (storms out)
good bye!
hi. look um, about what happened earlier...
(throws her stuff down) i was going to give you a chance to apologise to me.
you had no right coming down to my office ross. you do not bring a picnic basket to somebody is work! unless maybe they were a park ranger!
but i told you, i did not have the time!
wh, ross what do you want from me? you want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
just a job!
ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I am doing something i actually care about. this is the first time in my life I am doing something that I am actually good at. i mean. if you do not get that...
well neither do i!
(shocked) oh my god.
oh my god. i cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, ross, no, you are, you are, you are making this too hard.
i do not know, i do not know. urrrgh! look, maybe we should take a break.
no. (ross is standing in the doorway.) a break from us.
(jumping up to answer the phone) hello!
(disappointed) oh.
no! sorry, i just thought you were somebody else. hi!
yeah. well, umm.....
(on the verge of tears) yeah, I am fine.
no! really, no, please, please, that is, that is okay.
oh, yeah, I am not, I am not hungry.
oh. okay, bye.
oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. i just, it was awful. i told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then i told him i wanted to take a break, i do not want to take a break.
no. (grabs an eggroll) and then i called him, and he was not there.
oh, thank you that is very helpful, I am glad you came over.
hello.
hi! oh, I am so glad you called.
nobody.
umm, honey, look he just came over to....
(picks up the phone and calls ross) oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. be home. be home, be home, be home. oh, you are not home.
(entering) hi, guys!
what is going on?
oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
(going through the mail) oh look! a letter from my mom.
oh yeah! i know.
(interrupting) oh my god! my dog died!
oh my god, le poo, our dog!
oh god, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. oh. (they all come out from monica's bedroom) oh my god.
it is le poo.
oh yeah! (turns to face him.)
what?
oh god. (he hands her some tissues.) no! oh not again! (wiping her nose.) this-this happened when my grandfather died. it is ugh! sorry. (she puts her head back.) oh, okay, so I am sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
sorry. sorry.
yeah, i know. it is ridiculous! i can not see you either.
hi!
okay, what is up?
yeah, i told you to give emily whatever she wants.
yeah?
that is crazy! you can not do that! what are you going to tell her? (pause) (realizes) oh god. ohh, you already agreed to this, have not you?
ohh! lucky me! oh my god! that is good news, ross! i think that is the best news I have heard since le poo died!
oh yeah, really? is it ross? yeah? okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
storming out!
yeah, well that is how mad i am!!
(entering) hi!
look, i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know, I have been obsessing about it all day and I would just love not to talk about it. all right?
that is not ross!
oh my god, its happening. it is already started. I am kip.
(to joey) do you even know who kip is?
see? yeah, you told me the story. he and monica dated when they broke up they could not even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? he got phased out!
well, of course i am! it is not going to happen to ross! he is your brother. (to chandler) he is your old college roommate. ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go.
honey, come on! you live far away! you are not related. you lift right out.
phoebe? (she turns her head further away.) I am sorry about the whole lifting out thing. (moves over next to her.) you got to come with me!
wherever i go. come on you and me, we will-we will start a new group, we are the best ones.
hi. what are you doing here? is not this against the rules?
oh, ross…
no, it is not better. i still do not get to see you.
well, for starters i would have said the right name at my wedding!
i know.
i know that too.
yeah, it is in there. (points to the bathroom.)
uh-huh!
(entering from her room) pheebs, i was wondering…
well and clearly not a minute sooner.
of course i packed! monica relax! i just wanted to ask phoebe her opinion on what i should wear tonight.
yeah, yeah, i know.
surprise!!
no, no do not get mad because look—this is what happened. so i-i started packing, then i realized, "what am i doing? i am lousy at packing!" right? but you love packing! so, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
ohhhhhh, look it is the roller blades.
you remember when we got these?
i guess you were not there. (they hug.)
I am sorry pheebs, i guess I am just really said that I am leaving.
i have one.
uh well, i guess I am not going to miss the fact that you are never allowed to move the phone pen. (laughs. monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
you get your messages!
so-so, you missed a message from who? chandler or your mom? or chandler? or your mom?
ooh, your brother. score!
you know what else I am not going to miss? "I am monica. i wash the toilet 17 times a day. even if people are on it!"
"I am monica, i do not get phone messages from interesting people. ever!"
"oh my god, i can not find a boyfriend! so i guess I will just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find in there!"
I am unpacking!
I am not moving! (she re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) is that picture straight?
hey, y’know what? you are the one who wants to make this big change and move in with chandler! you should be the one to go! why should i have to leave?!
well it is mine too! what else you got?!
look! this is ridiculous. we should be packing you!! (she knocks over monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
great! monica’s moving!
oh really?! then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (monica starts chasing rachel around the table.)
yeah, I am just mad!
funny, because i was just going to go across the hall and write that on chandler.
well, phoebe that is fine because I am not moving.
oh really? like what monica?
oh yeah, good start mon.
yeah and you stretch ‘them out with your big old clown feet.
yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.
well y’know, i do not want you to be cold.
oh, it is going to be fine.
but honey, i think she is moving in with chandler.
okay.
oh! i have your key. here you go. (hands it to monica.)
yeah.
oh god! this is silly, I am going to see you in a couple of hours! (they hug again.)
bye house!
bye mon.
(through wall) ooh... i love barbados!
i know, I am her!
ooh...
hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? what changed?
what? ross and charlie? (joey nods) wow! she is really making her way through the group, huh? ah, who am i to talk?
oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he knows we are just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant. (joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) that is not nonchalant!
oh... okay, just hide!
coming! try under the bed, try under the bed!
there is no room under the bed. (looks around because she can not find joey anymore)
yeah... (still looking to see where joey went, and opens the door)
hi...
...i really do not... (looks around again)
yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if joey is there)
(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where joey went) uh-huh... right... yeah...
(still searching) oh, i know... i know it is been really hard for you.
(now looking up at the ceiling) that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say.
you would think!
joey!
(still can not find him) how are you doing this?
how... wha... hey! what are you... what is this? have you guys been listening this entire time?
ah, what is this? well, let us see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we are talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade!
all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it...
sure...
get out!
are they right?
yeah... yeah, we can wait, we do not have to do anything tonight.
(joey walks to the door) although...
i mean, you know... ross and i have not dated in like... six years...
plus, you know, he is with charlie now.
no...
yeah...
forgotten.
nothing...
nothing... it is really... it is nothing... come here, come here...
sorry, i just uhm... i can not seem to get ross out of my head...
ross is coming over. i think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
okay, well keep in mind that by the time you are done, they will probably be serving dinner.
still nervous?
yeah!
yeah, yeah sure! yeah! (mouths "good luck" to joey and gets up from her seat)
so hi!
so you eh, you talked to joey?
oh! that is great!
oh, so everything's okay?
ah... well, obviously i think so too.
really? excited?
excuse me! (and she walks back to joey, who is still looking very impressed about what ross said to him. rachel looks at him and hits him.) you did not tell him, did you?
oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him.
that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
aaah... ross, actually there is something that i really need to talk to you about.
okay, uhm... alright, here is the deal.
what? what is it?
uh, look ross, this really is not easy.
because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
well, yeah... okay, look it is about me and...
wow! well, clearly this is not a good time.
hi!
well, i tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. so i guess now it is your turn again.
yeah, because that is what we do.
okay, that sounds fair. it just means that once again we can not...
no! of course we can wait. alright, so i guess that means good night then?
goo--ood night!
seriously, good night!
okay.
okay, okay, i checked. we have: earl grey, english breakfast, cinnamon stick, camomile, mint medley, blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there is one more, um.. lemon soother. you are not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (guy shakes his head) okay.
thank you. (examines it) oh, cool! free sample of coffee!
oh. right. ...oh great.
country club newsletter. my mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' oh my god! oh my god, it is barry and mindy!
barry who i almost.
mindy, my maid of. oh!
what?
oh, I am sorry. oh, this is so stupid! i mean, i gave barry up, right? i should be happy for them! i am, I am happy for them.
no. oh, oh, i guess it would be different if i were- with somebody.
oh, i do not know. i guess it is not about no guys, it is about the right guy, y'know? i mean, with barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. with paolo, that is all there was, was heat! and it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
well, i mean, do you think you can ever have both? y'know? someone who is like, who is like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
hi, how was the movie?
(to marcel) and i will see you tomorrow!
now, now the one in the feather boa, that is dr. francis. now, she used to be a man. okay, now look, see, there is raven. we hate her. we are glad she is dying. okay- (marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) wh- wh- marcel, are you playing with monica's shoes? you know you are not supposed to pl- whoah. marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (takes the shoe into the kitchen) marcel, bad monkey! oh! oh! (she notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) sorry, barry. little engagement gift. I am sure you did not register for that. (she leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. however, she leaves the door open. marcel runs out in the opposite direction. there is a shot from the tv and rachel runs back in) who died? who died? roll him over! oh, c'mon, roll him over! oh...! well, we know it was not dexter, right marcel? because- (looks down and notices he is missing) marcel? marc- (notices the open door)
i do not know. we were watching tv, and then he pooped in monica's shoe-
i do not know. the left one.
oh. oh, those little clunky amish things you think go with everything.
c'mon, you guys, what are we going to do, what are we going to do?
oh, my, god, c'mon, you guys! he is going to be home any minute! he is going to kill me!
well, what'm i going to do? what'm i going to do?
anybody want to trade? oh...
(on the phone) okay, he is a, he is a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (enter ross) ...with, with russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. okay. thanks.
great! it went great. really great. hey, is that wine?
oh, i would love some. but y'know what? y'know what? let us not drink it here. I am feeling kind of crazy. you want to go to newark?
oh god, ross, i cannot do this.
oh god... okay. alright. alright. okay. ross, please do not hate me.
y'know marcel?
well, i kind of... i kind of lost him.
i know, i know, I am sorry-
(tearfully) ross, I am doing everything that i can, I have got everybody looking for him, and i- (door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) oh! who is it?
see? I have even called animal control!
uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
of-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
hi, thanks for coming.
oh, y'know what? that was a complete misunderstanding! (ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
turned out it was a hat.
cat! what'm i saying? cat!
yeah!
luisa? oh my god! monica! it is luisa!
yes!!
none.
what?!
marcel?
ross, you do not know that.
ross, i said I am sorry like a million times. what do you want me to do? you want me to break my foot too? okay, I am going to break my foot, right here. (kicks the sign) ow!! oh! oh my god, oh my god! there, are you happy now?!
y'know, it is not like i did this on purpose.
ross.
ross.
ross!
then what is with all the bananas?
oh, c'mon, luisa!
alright. in high school i was the prom queen and i was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! but if you take this monkey, i will lose one of the most important people in my life. you can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. c'mon, luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! take it!
alright. well then how about i call your supervisor, and i tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
oh, ross, c'mon. it is my fault, i almost lost your...
that would be good.
barry?!
(deadpan) yes, the hard part is truly over.
hi! (ross is stunned.)
ross, you stay here and talk, I am going to go have a baby.
(interrupting her) whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I am sorry, semi-private? we (laughs), we asked for a private room.
okay. just give us a second. ross! (they walk away from the desk.)
give her some money.
they are not!! ross, they are just saving them for the important people!! okay?! what-what if i was the president?!
(standing up) okay. y’know what? I would have to say i really do not care for your tone. and this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—whoa! (she starts a contraction) oh gosh! whoa!
ow! ow! contraction. (sits back down.) ow-ow! ow-ow! (starts breathing heavily.)
yeah, it could not hurt to look.
oh, okay.
thank you. (dr. long exits.) well, i guess we have some time to kill.
yeah well it looks great!
hi!
how are you?
yeah it is.
that is so sweet.
oh.
oh no, i really do not want any—(he takes the picture)—oh! thank you. oh. oh ross…
here comes another contraction.
oh, that is very—really very-very okay.
(simultaneously as ross) no, i do not think we will be doing that.
oh. oh wait no.
no-no-do not! do not leave me here with these people.
no ross! ross! ross! my child has no father!
hi!
oh, thank you so much for coming. ross, get in here!
new people.
they are having their baby! it is not fair ross we got here first! right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little jamie just crowning away.
well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. oh god oh! contraction!
ooh! ow!!
ross.
he is looking at me.
ugh, is she pregnant yet? she does not need to be; she will still have the baby before i do. oh ross, another contraction! (leans back on ross for some support.)
yeah it was.
dr. long, I have been at this for seventeen hours! three women have come and gone with their babies, you got to give me some good news! how many centimeters am i dilated? eight? nine?
hey, y’know what? I am not waiting! I am going to push this baby out! I am doing it! i mean it is what? three centimeters? that is got to be like this! (holds her hands a couple inches apart.)
oh stupid metric system!
oh for the love of god!
oh come on!!
okay! okay wait! you listen to me! you listen to me! since i have been waiting four women, that is four, one higher than the number of centimeters that i am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I am next! it is my turn! it is only fair! and if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I am going to sue you! not this hospital, I am going to sue you! and my husband (points at ross) he is a lawyer!
go get back on that case honey!
okay, well then bring her in.
oh!
i get it!
oh we-we did not.
just tell me how.
oh hi.
oh not bad. do you know that feeling when you are trying to blow a saint bernard out your ass?
oh that is five ross. five women have had five babies! and i have had no babies! why does not she want to come out?
oh. look at you making up crap for me. oh god! (starts another contraction as dr. long enters.)
doctor you got to do something! i think you got to give me drugs or you got to light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
what?
my god. okay. (another woman enters.) ha-ha-ha beat ya! sucker!
3-2-1 oh!!
i can not. i can not push anymore, i can not.
oh god twenty seconds my ass!!
do not say, "oh my god!" oh my god what?
oh god. is she going to be okay?
I am sorry, i can not!
i can not!
i can not. please, you do it for me.
are you okay?
oh god!
oh, she is so tiny. (starts crying) where did she go?
okay. well be careful with her, she is really tiny.
oh hey you. thanks for coming out of me. (the baby cries.) i know. oh. yeah. oh, she is looking at me. hi! i know you.
no, not yet.
oh no, baby girl geller-green.
hello baby girl.
here. (hands her to monica.)
what?
oh nothing i… sorry, i just can not stop crying.
so? you guys are all sleep deprived. i do not see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. oh god. (starts to cry harder.)
i was reliving it.
yeah, and y’know what? i love them both, so why do not you just pick one and that will be it.
that is not her name! I am sorry, she just does not feel like an isabella.
oh great! suddenly she sounds like a biblical who are.
well what are we going to do?
well tell us! what are they?
and if it is a girl?
oh, just tell us! we are not going to want it!
(gasps) emma! (looks at the baby and starts to cry.) see? i do not want it.
what?
oh honey, but you love that name.
ohhh! (looks at aaron and recoils in horror.) wow! he kind of takes your breath away does not he?
oh, I am fine. (gasps in pain as she sits down.)
oh, I am not doing it alone. i have ross.
well then he gets a divorce, it is ross!
well i—that is never going to happen with ross.
really?
well… that is…y’know—that is—we have been alone for the last twenty minutes we are doing okay. besides y’know what? i-i—maybe we will not be alone, ‘because lately i-i—things have been happening between me and ross, y’know? right before i went into labor, we-we had this kiss. y’know? so it might be the…the beginning of something.
uh-huh. (ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) y’know what i was, i was thinking about?
umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. that was some-something huh?
(pause) right.
no! no, of course not. no. that is why i brought it up. (pause) they did not have any sodas?
that is all right. (he goes to get her a soda.) and so it begins.
nothing.
really it is nothing. I am just…
I have just been thinking about how my baby and i are going to be all alone.
oh please, he will be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
I am just saying that y’know, someday ross is going to meet somebody and…he is going to have his own life. right?
i just never thought i would raise this baby all by myself. pretty dumb huh?
joey. honey what would i do without you?
oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? they are right on that chair under ross’s coat.
okay.
joey.
(seeing the ring) oh my god. (pause) okay.
hi!
my god!
congratulations! wow!!
mmh-mmh!
oh, pheebs, baby, that is nice but, you know what, i think I am ok. why do not you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
(angrily) give me the book! (she takes it and start reading) pablo diaz, brady smith, huh, "guy-in-van"?
oh!
phoebe, is not jethro tull a band?
hi!
I am sorry, this sounds like something I am never going to be interested in.
just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses did not. then that way, you are the good guy and they are the bad guys.
who is gladys?
(sarcastic) oh, and monica gets to keep her? in her house? i am so jealous!
well, i mean, sure, of course. but... you already gave that to monica, so...
no, i could not let you do that.
but i do not want you to.
but i insist harder!
(sarcastic) no, no, that is ok. you won fair and square. I am so sad!
did you watch the tape?
but you are a liar.
well, this is going well. (chandler looks worried)
(surprised by how ugly it is) wow! (sarcastic) oh, she is so nice and big! oh, monica, where are you going to display gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
well, hey! how about right above the tv? (points to the spot where her famous french poster is hanging). that way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
(jumps at the chance to make that happen) oh! there is nothing above your bed!!
of-oh my god!
joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
joey, we are not keeping this!
alright, fine. you can keep it. as long as you do not mind that she is haunted.
well, legend has it joey, that... she comes alive when you are asleep.
she climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) and then with her one good hand, she slo-of-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
well, why i told him it is haunted. two can play at this game. (gives gladys to monica)
yes i can! (pushes her back again)
she is yours!
she is yours!
she is mine!
she is mine!
i want gladys!
she is mine!
she is mine!
excellent!
ha ha ha, third time this week. man, this does not get old.
oh, do not be such a baby!
i love how he cares so much about stuff. if i squint i can pretend he is alan alda.
‘okay. (listens) okay, daddy we will see you tomorrow night. (listens) okay bye-bye.’ (hangs up)
are ah, having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, i hope that is okay.
ross, my father does not hate you.
but honey he calls everybody by a nickname! okay, look, i know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. i just want him to love you like i do. (ross looks at her) all right, well not exactly like i do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I will love you like i do in that black thing that you like.
thank you.
hi daddy!
you remember ross.
yeah, actually daddy ross is allergic to lobster.
okay.
aw honey stop! it is not that bad.
yeah. that is daddy.
yes, it bothers me ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I would be serving him sneezers.
so. ross, I have bugged him about this a million times, he is not going to change.
well um, i do not.
yeah it is, it is. (to ross) we really, really have to do something about that.
oh daddy, no he did not mean anything by that, he really did not.
you had to do it, did not you? you could not just leave it alone.
ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (ross groans and rubs his neck) oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
um. yeah.
all right, look, here is the bottom line ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. so, I will invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
okay, look, ross, i realise that my father is difficult, but that is why you have got to be the bigger man here.
okay, well can not you just try it one more time ross? for me? for me?
okay, well you are just going to have too, okay. because i already got a mother and a father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, i do not want to have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)
(opening the door) hi daddy.
what? what? he is interested in you. he-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
what?!
he is got this thing. and i keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
excuse me, dr. bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
well that is his last name.
it is robert bobby.
and um, excuse me, he helps me.
with my alignment. I have got one leg shorter than the other.
what? it is true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
I am sorry, let her?
no.
yeah honey, I am standing right there! why did not you just tell him about the mole i have not got checked yet.
so are things with you and joey any better?
oh wow, eight hours? so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
you should not.
well, I am going to take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
i know, but all that work you are doing to get it ready, i just… (goes into her bedroom.)
(standing in her doorway) people are trying to sleep in here!
honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
ooh, so cute, that I am thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
i know, it is sick.
because it is richard’s son! it is like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner!
is he okay in there?
so now, what exactly is the point of the box?
(worried) why?
okay. (she goes into her bedroom)
(coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) here it is! i love it. i wear it all the time.
huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
well is not it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of?
credit.
ooh, i like those sunglasses.
(swears in italian, it is the same term used by joey earlier and joey nods his approval.)
fancy soap? i thought we were savin’ that for the pope!
(pouring the wine) sick-sick-sick-sick.
ross, can you pass me the yams?
would you stop?! what is the matter with you?!
okay, fine. (she gets up and walks into her bedroom)
do not say that i have no sentiment! (starts to show ross what is in the box.) this is a movie stub from our first date! this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (holds up a bone) this is from the museum from the first time we… were together. okay, maybe i exchange gifts sometimes, but i keep the things that matter!
joey, had reasons.
what?!
oh, he sees her!
