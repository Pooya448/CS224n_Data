oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
oh my god, they took my idea!
that was you?!
yeah! okay, here you go. (rolls her back to rachel)
oh my god, are you guys okay?
(leaving central perk and seeing monica laying on top of rachel who is moaning in pain.) oh my.
(sporting a goatee) hey.
hey. y'know with that goatee you kind of look like satan.
oh, so that is why the priest threw holy water on me. (there is no reaction from joey) okay, listen, you have to cheer up! okay? you should come out with ross and me, i mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about kate.
hey i was crying because, because nobody believed quincy’s theory. okay?
(entering) hey!
hey.
(triumphantly) I am going to be on tv!!
no way!
yeah! they are putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in peru and the discovery channel’s going to film it!
oh my god! who is going to watch that?!
thanks. you ready to go?
yeah. (they start to leave)
saw a girl with that vest.

(on phone) yeah, hi. you guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘because i was watching this ah, commercial on tv and man, those guys are cute!
hi! hey, pete you are back! hey, check this out. (she starts to skate over to him)
wow! you are a lot sturdier that chandler. he crumpled like a piece of paper. so how was you are trip?
oh, what did ya bring me?! (she opens the gift) awww, hotel toiletries from japan. oh, these are going to go in my permanent collection. you want some coffee?
(popping back up) regular or decaf?
okay. (hands him a cup)
so what did you do today pete?
what?! oh.(she turns around quickly and falls)
can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
what a jerk! you want me to kick his ass?
i mean this has been like my dream since i got my first easy bake oven and opened easy monica’s bakery. i mean i would kill for this job. i mean i can totally do this job, and god knows i paid my dues. (she removes her fake breasts) but pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.
and you are still not attracted to him at all?
hmm, no. i mean how can i accept a restaurant from him? i-i-i-i can not. i could not even accept a necklace from stu vincent in the seventh grade.
yeah, but mon that is totally different. he was you are health teacher.
oh, please.
what? honey.
oh, i am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
oh god, I am so sorry.
i know.
ow!!
oh god!
(entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) hey, you guys! guess what?
(looking at the outfit) got a job on a river boat?
y'know what i did not wear this suit for a year because you hated it. well, guess what? you are not my girlfriend anymore so...
oh i see, so this suit is making a point.
right.
now that you are on you are own, you are free to look as stupid as you like.
(to monica) you like it right?
oh absolutely. i like it even more on you than i did on colonel sanders. (ross starts to leave) ross! ross! I am kidding!
yeah, come here!
what-what was it you were going to tell us?
yeah. oh! was how you invented the cotton gin?!
okay, good bye! (leaves)
so um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
umm, oh, about three months.
okay, so i guess that is about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
(entering carrying a box) hey!!
hey!
i got you something! open it! open it!
okay. (he opens it and it is a baby chick) it is a chicken.
it is cute, huh?
whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
fowl? no. women? nooo.
okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. they require constant care. they-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.
oh, well no problem there. (he picks up the chick, hugs it really tight, and talks to it like it is a little baby.)
easy lenny.
okay. here is the thing.
i can not do it. I am sorry, i wish i could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
huh?
oh?
oh, that is great! i mean I am-I am sorry, but I am so happy for you. and now i can work for you!
oh my god! oh, this is incredible! ohh! (she rolls over and kisses him on the cheek) all right, y'know what? I am just going to roll right into that office and-and quit!
okay. (she gets ready to go) can you give me a little push?
(rolling towards the office) I am quitting!! woo-hoo! (she rolls through a doorway and out of sight. we then hear a big crash, and see monica roll past the door the other way.) I am okay!! I am all right!!
(to pete) wow! that is exciting, you went to japan, made up a woman.
I am just saying, this woman, i mean she is fictitious. no?
‘because you are still into monica. so you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘because you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
yeah, no, I am fairly intuitive and psychic. it is a substantial gift.
absolutely, oh i promise. tell her what?
no I am serious. i mean I am intuitive, but my memory sucks.
okay, but this is the last time. (singing) with a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(joey enters)-chickeeeen.
hey.
hey.
how is she doing?
she?
well yeah, do not-do not you think it is a she?
i do not know. (he picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) i can not tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
well, anyway, i got to go change, I am ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
excuse me?
what?
i stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
hey! who was up from 2 of the clock this morning until 5 of the clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
you do not think i get up when you get up?
ohhh, here it comes.
yes, here it comes! I am stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? well i do not think so mister!
hey!! i need to relax! okay? i was working all day!
and you do not think taking care of our chick is work?
that is not what i said. okay, i just meant...
i know what you meant!! (pause) you notice that ever since we got this chick, we have been fighting a lot more than we used too?
i do not know, maybe we were not ready to have a chick.
I will take her back tomorrow.
do you think we will get our three bucks back?
(entering carrying a garment bag) hey!
hey!
(sees the chick) ohhh, hey! all right, listen, i-i have that tv thing in like two hours, and i need your help, okay? what do you think? (takes out two suits) this blue suit, or this brown one?
well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
really? (joey gives him a ‘like i would know’ look)
(she reaches for the bottle) oww! (she grabs the bottle, but has trouble opening it. she pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as ross enters.)
wow! that aspirin dance really works!
(she bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) oww!
oh my god, is that still...
I am fine, I am fine.
no you are not.
yes i am!
rach!
look, I am fine. watch. (she picks up an aspirin between her toes) look at that. (she lifts her leg to grab the aspirin with her hand and almost falls over.) whoa-whoa!
(stopping her from falling) okay, okay. look, you have got to go to a doctor! okay?
no. i have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. it is a very big deal, there is a lot of people there i have to meet.
and I am sure you are going to make a big impression. hi! I am rachel green. it is nice to meet you. (he lifts his leg and imitates shaking hands with it, just like how rachel was trying to pick up the aspirin with her feet.) come on, you probably have a broken rib!
well, i will go to the hospital tomorrow, it will still be broken then.
rach...
but y'know, i could use a hand getting ready.
rachel...
look, either help me or go.
fine. I will go.
(with a hurt expression on her face) okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
(he checks his watch) sure. I will help you.
(rushing in) oh, good! good! do you guys know how to get a chick out of a vcr?!
(she drops the brush) y'know what? i cannot do this with my left hand! would you please, help me with this too?
ohh. (he drops the shoes, takes the brush from her, and licks the tip. he does not like how it tastes.)
(taking the brush back) okay. let us use this brush. (hands him another one.)
okay. this stuff?
yeah.
all right.
careful. light. okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. okay? just sweep it.
oke-dokey. (he pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
oh-ho!
sorry.
hey! that is just poking me in the eye!
sorry, I am sorry. close, close, close...
okay, just sweep it.
I am sweeping...
right.
sweep, sweep....(he starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she has a black eye.)
okay, now make it even, ‘because we do not...
what? what?
we do not want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
no. no, y'know you do not, you do not wear enough of this. (rachel is shocked) what?
since when, since when do you think i do not wear enough of this?
well i, close your eyes, i just think you are going to like this a little better, ‘because, close-close... (he gets some more on the brush)
blow it.
(blows it) sorry. ‘because umm, i think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
sophisticated like a hooker?
hey!
hey!
hey, guess what I am doing tonight.
what?
I am checking out the restaurant with pete.
ohh, monica, i am so excited for you.
i know.
ooh, i have to tell you something.
what?
but i can not tell you.
okay, but would not it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
well, sure in a perfect world. but, no, i promised i would not tell, and i swore to like all my gods.
okay. does it have to do with ross and rachel?
no.
does it have to do with joey?
no.
does it have to do with-with chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
no, but let us come back to that later!
there you go! good enough for your party, huh?
sure.
yep?
sure, I will just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
okay, come on! all right, i got to go! so good luck at the party. okay?
oh wait, ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
(checks his watch) sure, okay.
okay. okay, great! umm, okay, just turn around.
what?
i do not want you to see me naked!
rachel, I have seen you naked a million times. i ate hot fudge off you naked. remember, i-i sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
yeah, but that was different. y’know? i mean, we were, we were going out then, now i think it is weird.
rach, y'know i can see you naked any time i want.
what?
all i have to do is close my eyes. see? (closes his eyes) woo-hoo!!
ross! stop that!
ah, I am sorry.
come on! i do not want you thinking of me like that any more!
ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. it is one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend. (closes his eyes again) oop, oh yeah!
stop it! cut it out! cut it out!
okay, okay, I am sorry, it will never happen... (closes eyes) uh-oh! wait a minute! wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I am the king.
rosss...
come on, would you grow up? it is no big deal.
all right. (she starts to take off her robe) fine.
yowzah!!!
of-kay!! see what you did, I am going to be doing it by myself now. okay?

i really do.
okay, I am going to get your coat and then I will-I will put you in a cab.
okay. oh wait, wait-wait, you are not going to come with me?
(he thinks about it) of course i am. i just have to make a call.
okay.
okay? (goes into the living room)
thank you. (she goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain) oww!!!! god!
(rushing back in) what?! i wh-, what is wrong?
I am sorry, i just can not go to the hospital lookin’ like this.
does it involve travel?
noo!
does it involve clogs?
oh, wait, wait. clogs, or claws?
clogs.
no.
claws?!
no.
okay, so it does not involve ross or rachel or chandler or joey. but, what about pete?
(shaking her head yes) no!
what is it?! what about pete?
i do not know! (frantically points at monica)
okay, i feel like I am talking to lassie. all right, phoebe would you just tell me!
i can not!!
okay, i got to go. (gets up)
i, but you are so close! no!
okay, does it involve something to do with pete’s computer company?
oh, just go. you are never going to get it!
i know. see, yes. that is yasmine bleeth, she is a completely different kind of chick. i love you both. but in very different ways.
(entering) hey!
hey!
(sees he is watching baywatch) ohhh. (sees he still has the chick) ahh! what are you doing?! i thought you were going to take her back to the store today.
i did! but the store would not take her back! so then i took her to the shelter, and you know what i found out?
if they can not find a home for her, they kill her! and I am not going to let that happen to little yasmine!
okay, good, good, good, ‘because, good, ‘because i was kind of having second thoughts too.
okay. and it is not just chicks y'know? it is all kinds of other animals!
that is horrible! well, you did the right thing man.
thanks, I am glad you see it that way.
ohhh-hoo, funny story!
i do not believe this! wow, look at this refrigerator! it is gigantic! i mean i could live in this thing! I would be cold, but I am always cold. oh my god, look at these spider burners! i love spider burners.
oh, it is sooo perfect. thank you so much. (runs over and hugs him)
did you just smell my hair?
oh god.
you still have feelings for me do not you?
pete.
no, it is not bad. it is not bad at all. it is-it is really nice.
you may be okay about getting hurt, but i am not okay with being the one who hurts you. that is why i can not take this job.
and well, we probably should not see each other anymore. I am sorry.
okay, bye.
all right shut up for a second and let me just see something. (she kisses him back on the lips) oh, wow! (they then hug and kiss, very passionately.)
okay, you would tell me the truth. right?
rach, you can not look fat in an x-ray.
okay.
okay! now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
(to chandler) that is a duck.
that is a bad duck!!! (to ross) how did the thing go tonight, ross?
oh, it was, nah, well....
what thing? what thing?
nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. come on. (they go into her apartment) easy.
(to the duck) okay, now when you come back i hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy! (he goes back into the apartment)
what thing? what is this thing?
i was kind of, supposed to be on tv tonight for the discovery channel.
oh my god!
yeah.
ross, why did not you tell me that?
eh, ‘because i knew that if i told you, you would make me go, and i knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. come on. come on.
i cannot believe you.
what?
that is the sweetest thing, i just....
(breaking the silence) you should get some sleep.
okay.
so, I will umm...
oh, I am sorry i spoiled you are evening.
no, that is, no, as long as you are okay. so I will ah, I will see you tomorrow.
um-hmm, yeah.
(after he closes the door) see ya.
(coming out of his apartment and seeing ross) what did you do?
what ‘cha doing?
having a swim.
what about the chick?
chicks do not swim.
are you sure?
i do not know. should we try it?
sure.
see, i told you they do not swim. (he goes to take it out)
(stopping him) wait. give him a minute.
noo! (takes him out) oh, it is okay, it is okay, baby, baby, baby.
hey! so what do you think?
new haircut? (monica nods ‘no.’) necklace? (no) dress? (no) boots? (monica nods ‘yes.’) boots!
yes! now, they are a little more than i normally spend on boots…or rent (shows him the receipt.)
oh my god!
i know.
I am going to miss being able to afford food.
I am sorry, they just, they just look so good! and the saleswoman was looking at me like, "oh, these are way too expensive for you."
she had a point. (shows her the receipt.)
(entering) hi!
hey.
oh my god! (notices the boots) oh monica! those boots are amazing!
they are mine!
yeah well, too bad we are going to have to return them.
return them?! shh! they are going to hear you!
honey, I am not returning them. okay? i mean i-i know they cost a lot, but I am going to wear them all the time. you will see. besides, i love the compliments. i mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
i have you.
nice try; I am keeping the boots.
that is right, i love you! and-and I am going to play with you all the time.
how can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
(pause) he is talking to the baby.
ohh! okay! okay, because when-when he said, "i can not wait to hear your first words," i thought, "there is a trick."
okay. well, i got to go you guys. I will see you later.
okay.
bye.
bye. (she gets up to leave but is stopped by joey)
oh hey rach, listen—hi!
hi.
umm, can you do me a favor? i was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at ralph lauren…
no, forget it! no way! i am not sending anymore ralph lauren clothes to prison. it is a waste.
no-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. my youngest sister, dina, she is really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.
i guess i can talk to one of my supervisors…
oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
really?! oh my god! I am successful!
okay, so will you meet with her?
yes! I would love to! have her come by the office.
great! thanks! you are going to love her so much. and—oh, she is the smartest of all the tribbiani children. hey, y’know the s.a.t’s?
yeah.
she took ‘them!
hey ross! does not ben go to the smithfield day school?
yeah. why?
sting has a son that goes there too!
yeah i know; he is in ben’s class.
you knew this and you never said anything?! with all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
fine! no more dinosaur stuff! can i talk about fossils? (joey is about to sit down and hears this so instead he groans and exits.)
sting’s son, seven years old and there is a picture.
what are you reading? the kidnappers guide to manhattan private schools?
no, it is new york magazine. it is an article about the best schools in the city. so how well do you know sting?
uh, i actually have not even met him.
uh-huh, yeah that is too bad. i really want to go to his concert friday night, but it is totally sold out. i know! why do not you meet him and get tickets?! if you get two I will take you.
well actually, I am picking ben up tomorrow, maybe he will be there.
there you go! oh, you are so lucky! you might actually get to meet sting tomorrow! that is why you have kids!
hey guys!
hey-hey.
hi monica!
hey. (sits down on the arm of the couch.)
hi boots.
see chandler? I am getting a lot of use out of them already! they are very practical. see, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…
you can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
wow! they are beautiful!
ahh…
(almost crying) they hurt so much!
what?!
the guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
well-well you can give them to me! i have not felt my feet in years!
i can not! i spent so much money on them and i told chandler that I would wear them all the time, i just can not give them away!
well then get your money back and return them!
i can not do that either! the soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
(entering) hey!
(returning to his seat) hey!
hey i uh just picked up ben from school…
(spinning around looking for him) i do not think you did a very thorough job!
i dropped him off at carol’s. (to phoebe) anyway, it turns out that I am not going to be able to get those tickets though.
oh no! why not?
well it turns out that ben and sting’s son do not get along.
how come?!
apparently, sting’s son made fun of the fact that ben’s moms are lesbinims.
wait! but ross if they do not get along then you should smooth things over. make them be friends.
phoebe, you can not force kids to be friends.
sure you can! give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
playpen?! ben’s seven!
your kid is seven?! (ross nods, "yes.") (to the rest) he is really small. (to ross) please! please get the tickets!
look I am sorry pheebs, i can not do it.
yes you can! sting says so himself!
what?
(singing) rosssss can!
look phoebe, I am sorry it is just…
(singing) rossss can!
phoebe, i…
(singing) rosss can! give me the tickets! ross can give me the tickets!!
(entering, with dina) here she is! future fashion superstar!
oh joey, I am hardly a…
my little sister dina!
right! hi dina!
nice to meet you. (they shake hands.)
this is so exciting for her. well, I will let you two fash…ists get down to business. (exits.)
okay. all right dina, well let us talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. let us see, there is design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. uh, there is-there is sales, which is great because you get to travel…
(stunned) and there is marketing…
(standing up) ahhhhhhhh!
(opening the door) what is wrong?
oh nothing I am just—just was yawning. (mimics the groan from before and stretches.)
oh do not forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (they go into the apartment.)
honey, we do not really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
now sweetie, i know you do not like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. see? every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
i-i do not-i do not think that I am going to wear the boots tonight.
why not?
well y’know, I am just-I am just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. or! or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
do you think i work at some kind of boot pricing company?
anyway, i picked up this outfit that i want to wear and the, and the boots do not really go with it.
you said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
fine! if you want me to wear the boots, I will wear the boots. in fact, I will go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.
okay.
okay? (she starts to walk which causes her to start crying) ooo wee! christmas party in my boots! (runs into the bedroom and mixes saying ‘ow’ with laughing.)
honey, it is going to be okay. he is been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that is what the meatball sub is for. (she gives dina a sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil.)
okay.
hey! it is my fashion girls! (they do not react.) what is wrong?
honey, why do not you sit down? dina has something that she wants to tell you.
(concerned) oh. what is, what is going on? is it mom? is she sick? is it dad’s heart? is that a sandwich?
is that a sandwich?!
joey…there is something that you…should know. dina?
(angrily) what?!
(to dina) now! give him the sandwich! give him the sandwich! (she quickly sets the sandwich in front of him.)
well obviously this is a mistake! you can not be pregnant! because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
what?! dina…
(to rachel) bub!!! (points at her and quiets rachel.) (to dina) i can not believe this! you are the good one! you went to college! both years! who did this to you?!
you got pregnant for funny?! dina…if he is funny…laugh! all right, I will be back in a little while! you stay here!
i can not look at you right now! (exits and slams the door behind him.)
i know.
oh, there you are ben!
well, i heard you are having a problem with one of the boys in your class. and so i thought i would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. now umm, the boy’s name is sting’s son.
now ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
him you are friends with. (starts looking at the children trying to find jack and a teacher notices her.)
yes! yes you can, I am looking for jack’s parents.
uh-huh, I am with ben.
i am one of ben’s mothers. I am a lesbian. it was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
oh.
ah! okay so that would make me susan.
yeah! let us do that!! that-that sounds good. we should sit down and talk, just me, my lover carol, and the stings. umm, how-how will i get in touch with them?
uh-huh. uh-huh. umm, could-could i get a copy of that? ‘because carol threw it out, she lost ours. she is such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
y’know, that party was not bad.
yeah! i did not know there would be dancing. that was a fun surprise!
i do not see any uh, cabs. maybe we should just walk?
oh no, we can not walk!
what honey, it is like fifteen blocks to the subway. let us go.
hey! do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
what is going on?
i can not walk. okay? okay? these boots were a huge mistake!
what?
okay you were right! all right, i never should have bought them! they are killing me! one toe at a time!
so i was right. this is what it feels like to be right. (pause) it is oddly unsettling.
how are we going to get home? maybe a piggy-back ride?
hop on.
okay. wait, just give me a second, i need to just get my boots off first. (she starts taking them off.) ah…ooh…oohh…ohh…oh god…ohh…oh…ohh…ohhhh…
honey, i know you are in pain right now, but I am a little turned on.
what college was that dina?
joey, what are you doing?
just what needs to be done! dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…
oh joey this is crazy!
do not interrupt me when I am talkin’ to god! now where were we? oh right, okay. do you dina, take this man…
oh you will take ‘them!
hey! you do not get a say in this!
ahhh! i heard "i do", we are halfway there! okay! (to bobby) you!
all right joey! that is enough! (grabs him and pulls him away from bobby and dina) listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it is not legal. okay? they-they do not have a marriage license, they do not have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
well what am i supposed to do?
you are supposed to realize that they are adults! and that they can make their own decisions.
no they can not! they were stupid enough to get knocked up!
heyyyyy! contraceptives are not always effective! (to bobby and dina) right?
oh, come on kids! a little help here!
wow! this place is incredible! (gasps) sting’s pen…that he gave to phoebe. (puts the pen in her purse and goes over to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase) come on! secret passageway! (starts pulling books at random as trudie enters.)
hi!
uh-huh.
why else would i be here?
uh-huh. (they go and sit down.)
yeah.
umm, I am sorry. will not-will not jack’s father be joining us?
uh-hmm. okay. well then, could we reschedule? for say, friday night perhaps at 8 of the clock?
concert. yeah. that does put us in…quite a pickle. because you see I am very busy before and after the concert, and he is obviously busy during.
unless! unless umm, okay i-i would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
oh, thank you. four would be great.
oh good! then you are in luck! ben’s not my son!
the police? here? a reunion?! (she gets out her camera.)
okay, ten blocks down. five to go.
(notices something in the window) oh wait! stop! stop! stop!
oh I am sorry! do you need a break?
my boots in tan! hey! can you get a little closer so i can see the price?
i can see it from right here. it will cost you one husband.
okay, I am sorry. i think i can walk the rest of the way now. just-just give me my boots.
(pause) i do not have your boots.
well i do not have them either. where are they?
well, why do not you check in one of my saddlebags while i chew on a bale of hay!
okay. (she gets off him.) god well, we got to go back and get them!
honey, are you seriously ever going to wear the boots again?
okay, I am never going to wear them again. i just did not get a chance to say goodbye.
y’know what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones.
okay. (climbs back on his back.) all right.
okay. (moves closer to the window.)
(to the boots) bye boots—wait! half off?! (chandler runs off.)
joey, just because they are not getting married does not mean this is going to be a disaster. maybe they have a plan!
oh? oh! okay! okay! let us hear their plan! now, what is the future look like for dina and bobby?
(to dina) you were right. he is funny.
hey, now wait a minute! i get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! now come on bobby, why do not you tell us a little bit about your band?
(to dina) really? (nods her head at bobby.)
dina, if you are having a baby you should be married! even if it is to bobby! (bobby gets happy.) dude, that is not a compliment!
so whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! what are you going to do? you are going to have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! you can not be a single mother alone! you are going to ruin your life!
oh excuse me! am i ruining my life?
no! no! no! it is different for you. you are so strong and together. you are not some dumb kid who does not know what she is doing.
one pregnant woman at a time, please! i just want you to be okay.
so forcing her to marry bobby is going to make that happen?
maybe! (to bobby) well! well…so-so uh, what kind of music does numb nuts—oh forget it! i can not!
because! ‘because… ‘because you are my baby sister!
well I would be scared of them, but all right.
of course he is going to have his uncle joey!
that is right! by his uncle too!
okay bobby, why do not we just come over here and let them have a little moment. (drags bobby away from joey and dina.)
come here! (hugs dina and bobby looks to hug rachel.)
no! seriously! what is wrong with you?!
you are going to love me so much. i got sting tickets!! (holds up two.)
oh my god! i do love you! how did you do it?!
well…let us just say… (singing) rosss caaaaan!
oo, where are the seats?
uh, middle balcony.
okay, now would you say that that is more than 50 yards away from sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
yeah.
then that is not breaking the law! I am there!
hey, you guys!
so, what do you think?
about what?
yeah, what?
what?
are you kidding? okay, I will give you a hint; I will give you a hint. (points to his glasses.)
eyes! no, no. your eyes! no. chandler’s eyes!
i got glasses!
well, you-you have always had glasses.
no i did not!
are you sure?
yeah-yeah, did-did not you use to have a pair? they were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…
feminine.
yes!
no!
sweetie, i think the glasses look great. they make you look really sexy.
really?
yeah!
(sitting down on the arm of her chair) you did not think i used to wear glasses, right?
of course! (she mouths, "i have no idea," to the rest of the gang.)
so what do you guys want for an engagement present?
that is okay pheebs, we are not having a party or anything, so you do not have to get us…
(interrupts him) if someone wants to give us a present, we do not want to deprive them of that joy.
oh, y’know what you should get ‘them? one of those little uh, portable cd players.
oh, i already have one.
not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means joey.
hey, i know i what i want!
what we want honey.
no, you do not want this. i want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.
you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
uh-huh, yeah.
you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that i would never let out of our family?
dying people say the craziest things.
i wanted it for years! i was going to make cookies for my children.
break my heart—oh, all right.
okay. I am going to be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.
our kids are going to be fat are not they.
(entering) ahoy!
hey! how is the boat?!
great! I am finally getting into this sailing stuff.
oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
why would i do that? it took three guys to get the thing in there!
if you do not sail your boat, what do you do on it?
oh, it is great! it is a great place to just kind of, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (he says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)
well, it is good that you finally have a place to do that.
y’know joey, i could teach you to sail if you want.
you could?
yeah! I have been sailing my whole life. when i was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
your own boat?
what?! what?! he was trying to cheer me up! my pony was sick.
do you know what i was thinkin’?
what?
nothing, i just like to go like this. (does it again.)
(entering from the bathrooms) hey chandler, what are you doing tonight?
uh why, do you have a lecture?
no, why?
then free as a bird. what is up?
my dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
wow! that is great! dad must really like you, he does not ask just anyone to play.
yeah and he did not really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you.
well, did-did you correct him?
no, i-i thought it would be more fun this way.
this is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. he does that every week too.
oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
yeah.
he hates to lose.
oh no problem, maybe I will play with my left hand.
you are not a lefty?
does anybody know me?!
what is wrong phoebe?
i just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
no!! why did not you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
(pauses as he figures out how to answer that) because I am normal! that was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and i know you wanted it as an engagement present.
oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
do not worry about it pheebs.
no one got me an engagement present.
okay, here i wish you health and happiness. (she hands monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)
an old cookie?
(to chandler) this is what happens when you do not register for gifts!
see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left.
we can not accept this.
why not?
‘because it is gross.
no! wait! i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie! i do stuff like this at work all the time.
really?!
yeah! i bet i can do it.
okay, we owe you a present.
two! I have been engaged twice!
(drinking a beer) look at this clown! just because he is got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (yelling) get out of the way jackass! (to rachel) who names his boat coast guard anyway?
that is the coast guard.
what are they doing out here? the coast’s all the way over there. (points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)
joey, just ignore the boats all right? we are not finished with the lesson yet.
all right.
okay, I am just going to go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
come on rach, not again. i got it! okay? let us start sailing, and i want to go over there (points) where that boatload of girls is! (yelling to them) yo-ho-ho!
oh, okay. is that what you want to do? you want to go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? okay, let us do that sailor joe. quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) what is this called?
uh, boat rope.
wrong! how do you get the mainsail up?
uhh, rub it?
no. what do you do if i say we are coming about?
I would say, come again. no-no, wait i-i-i know this one, i know this one, uh…
time’s up, now your dead.
and deaf!
okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. am i getting through to you sailor?! (she punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)
yes.
do not just say yes! this is not a game, joey you can really get hurt out here. okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler.
all right, i definitely taste nutmeg.
you do?
you do not? (laughs) well, that is the difference between a professional and a layman.
that and arrogance.
(entering) hey.
hey! how was sailing?
i do not want to talk about it. y’know, you could have at least saved me a whole cookie. (he grabs what is left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)
(recoils in horror) women are mean!!! (storms out.)
i can not believe that! now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb. (she picks it up with her finger and holds it out to monica.) i wish you a long and happy marriage.
(entering with chandler) hey.
hey! how was it?
well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand…
i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding. he even said i could call him dad.
and what did he ask you not to call him?
daddy. all right look, here is the story. (flashback to chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were going to take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (the flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. he takes off his glasses.) so i take off my glasses and that is when in happened.
guys?
over here. (you can see ross sitting at the far wall.)
oh my god chandler! i can not believe it!
i know.
you gave my father a lap dance!
why do they put so much steam in there?!
‘because otherwise they would have to call it the room room.
why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
come on, it is not that big a deal!
not that big a deal? there…there was touching of things.
now, i know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
listen, I am sure that dad does not care. he probably thought this was funny; he will be telling this story for years!
i do not want him to tell this story for years.
oh, but he will. he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp.
i was not escaping.
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
i was trying to help out a squirrel.
you were trying to eat it!
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
(takes the phone from ross) come on. (answering phone) hello? (listens) I am sorry you have the wrong number. (listens) (whispering) okay, I will call you later dad. i love you. (hangs up.)
(getting up) all right, I am off to see your dad.
whoa-whoa, are not you a little over dressed?
(laughing) yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to face—and by face i do not mean his lap. and by face, i do not mean my ass. (exits.)
(to rachel) hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present?
i do not know. y’know, they did not get us anything.
thank you!
(entering) hey.
hey.
well hello! so, when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?
oh uh, i do not know the boat way to say this, but uh never!
why not?
because! you are mean on the boat!
what? i was just trying to teach you.
well, lesson learned! rachel is mean!
yeeeeeep… yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. i remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she would not let me help at all.
excuse me, i wanted you to help, but you could not move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
you have to respect the sea! (storms off.)
look joey, I am sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but i got to tell ya something. that was not mean. okay, my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat, i mean it was horrible. i was just being a good teacher.
does a good teacher say, "put down the beer pinhead!?"
well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
six and a half! you knocked that last one out of my hand! remember?
yeah, i did not want you to get hit by the boom!
well it hit me anyway! and it would have hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer.
all right, y’know what? i-I am sorry. i will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
you will not boss me around anymore?
i will not boss you around.
and you will be nice?
and, I will be nice.
and you will be topless?
and—joey!
do you want me to learn?!
okay, here is batch 22. ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. this has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
let us give it a shot.
okay. man, i have not made this many cookies since i was in the ninth grade.
oh, what was that for? like a bake sale?
no, just a friday night.
ohh, these are pretty good.
yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
which one was that?
the ones we had right after you almost threw up.
oh yeah! batch 17 was good. i did not like batch 16. (burps a little bit.) I am okay.
are there anymore from the good batch? ‘because we could just work off of those.
yeah, ooh yeah, i think there is one from batch 17 left, uh… (grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and does not like it.) it is batch 16! 16 people! get out of the way! (gets up and runs for the bathroom.)
okay joey honey, you are doing really good! all right, now I am just going to need you to step to the port side. (joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) remember? remember how we talked about the port side?
ohh yeah.
right?
nope.
it is left sweetie, but that is okay sweetie, that is a tough one.
i do not know why you just do not say left.
okay, go to the left. (joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) the left!
huh?
(yelling) just sit over there!! (points to the port side.)
(hurrying over) okay! okay, you are yelling again! see that?
no! no-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.
oh, y’know what? since I am here, i think I am going to have me a little beer on the port side. (grabs and opens one.)
okay joey, we are luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (the mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)
uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff i did not know there.
joey, come on! we just went over this! (she does it instead.)
oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. did you see it? it was gross!
(angrily) no! all right?! i did not see the bird! i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson! i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
all right that is it! you are yelling and i do not see you taking your top off! i quit!
what do you mean you quit?! you can not quit!
why not?!
because you are not finished yet and i will not have it! greens do not quit!
greens? I am a tribbiani! and tribbianis quit!
oh my god, wait did i—i just said greens do not quit did not i? (pause) (angrily) did i just say greens do not quit?!
yes! yes! you did and you are still yelling at me!
no! no! no! I am not yelling at you, I am just yelling near you. oh god joey, ohh I am my father. oh my god, this is horrible! I have been trying so hard not to be my mother i did not see this comin’. oh, joey, I am sorry. I am so sorry. i just wanted you to learn.
well, hey i did learn.
really?
yeah! come on.
awww…
yeah, it is okay. i know what a mainsail is. (points to it. it is the larger sail.) i know, i know to duck when the boom comes across. i-i know port is right.
left.
damnit!
y’know, i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we are trying to figure out her recipe. i bet she is l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.
looking up?
oh yeah—no, she was really nice to me, but she is in hell for sure.
well, I have tried everything. i give up. i guess I am not going to be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  kids love that right.
aww, pheeb, come on is not there any relative that would have the recipe? what about, what about your sister?
oh no-no, no, i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body. and that is not happening ‘til october 15th, 2032.
that is the day you are going to die? see—darnit, I have got shuffleboard that day.
that is what you think.
well, i mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? would not they have the recipe?
well, y’know i may have relatives in france who would know. my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, nesele tolouse.
what was her name?
nesele toulouse.
nestle tollhouse?!
oh, you americans always butcher the french language.
(grabbing a bag of nestle tollhouse chocolate chips) phoebe, is this the recipe? (tosses her the bag.)
(reading the recipe on the back of the bag) yes!! (realizes.) ohh.
i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
i know! you see it is stuff like this which is why (looking down) you are burning in hell!!
so you understand, I would feel a lot more comfortable if you did not tell people what happened. y’know, I am a little…I am a little embarrassed about it.
what did you do when they found out?
so i guess we wear swimsuits in here!
well joey, i hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
yeah, yeah. hey, why do not you give a pull on that rope? (points.)
ohh we are not sailing.
just pull on it.
all right. (she does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) hey-hey-hey!! (sees what is in the cooler.) sandwiches!
what else?
(hands him one) here you go.
thank you.
oh wow! (she takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)
what are you doing?
ohh, sorry.
what you—do not hold it like that! you are lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.
ohh whoops.
careful! you are wasting good pastrami! (gasps.) oh my god! I am my dad!
hey! babe! are not you excited we are going on our honeymoon?
yeah i am!
(singing) bermuda, bahama, come on pretty mama…
that is right. get it out of your system while we are alone.
(entering with phoebe) hey!
yeah! have a great honeymoon!
I would better go pack.
oh no, i already packed. the only thing i could not find though was your speedo.
a speedo? uh, i do not have a speedo. I am going to go pack my regular long bathing suit. (goes into the bedroom.)
(entering) oh good you are still here!
hey!
i want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (hugs monica.)
thank you.
and i also wanted you guys to know that i am telling the father today. (they all look at her expectantly) what? what? what?
we know its ross!
how?! how do you know?
it was his sweater, but—oh my god!
oh, i so wanted ross to know first, but I am so relieved you guys know.
this is so great! and I am going to be your baby’s aunt!
i know! (they hug.)
me too! (joins the hug.)
I am going to be an uncle! come here! (he joins the hug.)
(breaking the hug) you are all going to be aunts and uncles.
yeah, but I am the only one related by blood.
okay. great! so now that you guys all know you can help me. give me some advice on how I am going to tell ross!
well, what were you going to say?
well i was going to tell him that I am-I am going to have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
well that, that sounds good.
yeah but how do i start? i mean, what is-what is the first thing that i say? (they all pause to think.) okay great! thanks. (she starts to leave.)
hey! good luck!
yeah, bye.
bye.
(entering) hey, what was that all about?
well i guess there is no harm in telling you now, rachel and ross are going to have a baby.
(in a high pitched voice) what?! i did not even know that—why did not you tell me?! (pause) why am i talking like this?!
i did not think you could keep it a secret.
(in the high pitched voice) what?! (normal voice) i am an excellent secret keeper. i have kept all of our secrets.
what secrets?
oh no-no joey, i am not going to tell you because i am an excellent secret keeper.
(whispering to chandler) you will tell me later?
you already know.
oh, it is so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
y’know, monica and chandler are married. ross and rachel are having a baby. maybe you and i should do something.
all in good time my love. all in good time. oh shoot! i left my guitar in their apartment. well you can let me in later.
i do not have a key, they took mine to give to you.
what?! they took mine to give to you!
why would they take away our keys?
maybe they do not trust us.
no that is not it. they let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
you mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with monica’s guest towels?
hey, i washed those!
no you did not.
yeah that did not sound like me.
well, what am i going to do? i really need my guitar!
yeah, i have stuff in there too.
what stuff?
monica’s chicken parm! I will take care of it. (he picks up the phone) hey mr. treeger, it is joey tribbiani. listen, i need to get into monica and chandler’s apartment. it is an emergency. (listens) uhh, gas leak! yeah oh, and bring garlic bread. (hangs up.)
(entering) hey!
did rachel find you?
no why?
oh she was looking for you.
oh well, i guess I will catch up with her later.
well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
yeah, it seemed pretty important.
oh no.
what?
i think i might know what this is about.
really?
yeah. uh, uh we promised we were not going to tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago rachel and i slept together.
(deadpan) and?
wow! i thought you would be a little more shocked.
oh sorry. (shocked) and?!
well, we-we said we would just do it that one time but, but now i think she may want to start things up again.
yeah, i do not think that is what it is.
why? what-what else could it be?
oh wow, i do not feel well.
I am telling you. I am telling you. that is what it is. no wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. she did not say anything to you?
(to joey) maybe it is something you ate?
please, just-just, just go and talk to rachel.
yeah, i guess i should. (starts to leave.) man, y’know what i have to realize? maybe I am just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. y’know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. i should remember that. (he pauses and then exits.)
they are kissing let us just go around them.
oh honey, leave them alone, they are in love.
I am in love too! but in an orderly fashion.
(to the couple) hi! can you do that and walk? ‘because she said, "next."
(to chandler) did you hear that?! they bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! come on! let us act like we are on our honeymoon.
we are on our honeymoon.
grab my ass!
hi, sorry. i almost did not hear you, because y’know I am just so in love with my new husband. we are on our honeymoon.
oh no, you see we are on our honeymoon. so umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
you see, if we would gone around them like i said, we—she would have given us those tickets. damnit!
25j and k, any chance those are not together?
i still can not believe they took away my key. you trust me with yours.
of course i do! and I am going to give it back to you as soon as they are done with it at the key shining place.
what the hell is that?
whoa! whoa! whoa! treeger, what are you doing?
well why do not you use your key?
oh! we could have done that.
look at that! look at that! they are going into the first class lounge! do you know what they have in there?
no.
me neither! we have to get in! (she runs through the door with chandler in tow.)
just act like you belong.
oh my god! oranges!
shh! (to the guy behind the counter) nice to see you again. (they tries to walk past him.)
yes, of course. (shows him the tickets.)
oh that is all right, i have it memorized. it is 1a.
apology accepted. excuse us. (they try to enter again.)
fine. (starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) go! go! go!
(seeing him) hi!
hi.
hi. (he helps her up.) umm, i think there is something that we really need to talk about.
(quietly confident) i think we do. why do not we go inside? (they go inside.) look uh, i know why you are here.
you do?
yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, i think maybe i should talk first.
(warily) okay.
okay. (he sits her down in a chair.) uh, ross and rachel. rachel and ross. that is been one heck of a see-saw has not it?
(confused) what?
i mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but do not you think it is better if we just stayed friends?
seriously. what?!
okay. okay. y’know what? if you want to, we can do it one more time. i mean I would-I would be okay with that. in fact, i have some time right now.
okay, y’know what? can i, can i talk now?
oh sure. (he sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
(touches his knee) I am pregnant. (ross stops.) ross? (ross is staring off into space.) ross? (ross is still frozen) okay, whenever you are ready. (sits back and opens her magazine.) and you are the father by the way—but you got that…
(closes her magazine) can i get you some water?
I am good. I am good.
ross, there is no pressure on you. okay? i mean you can as involved as you want. (ross nods.)
yeah, i need uh… I am just—i do not know—i do not understand, umm, how this happened? we-we used a condom.
i know. i know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
what? what? what?!! well they should put that on the box!!!
they do!
no they do not!!! (he runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
okay ross come on let us just forget about the condoms.
oh well i may as well have!
listen, y’know what? i was really freaked out too when i found out…
freaked out? hey no, I am not freaked out! I am indignant! as a consumer!
y’know what? let us, let us talk later.
no! no! i want to talk now! okay? i—in fact, (picks up the phone) i am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
okay, y’know maybe i should come back… (starts to leave.)
(grabs her) shh! shh! shh!
(stops) okay.
(on phone) yeah I will press 1! (presses one which allows rachel to escape.)
(eating) huh. so then i can heat this up? (goes and does so.)
oh great! and listen, could you do us a favor and not tell chandler and monica about this? ‘because y’know umm, they do not-they do not have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
oh no.
hi.
sure.
namaste. (bows.)
oh my god! what happened to the door?!
so it is noticeable huh?
look, is rachel here? i really need to talk to her.
did not you two already talk?
yeah but uh… okay, okay look you guys know that rachel and i slept together, but there is something else. (pause) rachel’s pregnant.
(simultaneously) oh my god!!! i can not believe that!!
(simultaneously) holy mother of god!!!
with my child.
that is brand new information!!
you already know do not you?
a little bit.
how are you doing?
okay. okay. i mean I will be okay. it is just i do not think i handled it very well.
well, what did you say to her?
nothing. but the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. and then when i turned around she was gone.
oh ross.
but hey, in my defense i-i just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
(shocked) what?
i got to go find her.
whoa! hey! whoa!! hold up! are you serious?! so like 3% of the time they do not even work?! huh? they should put that on the box!
evidently they do.
what?! (grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
i can not believe we are here.
oh you have got to be kidding me.
what? (monica sees the first couple and gasps.)
no!! you have been screwing us all day!
we are you just ten seconds later!
yeah! you already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! i mean we should get free stuff too! i mean you are not the only ones on your honeymoon!
(looks at monica then at them) we need the stuff.
hey monica it is joey. listen uh, phoebe and i smell gas comin’ from your apartment.
what? are you serious?! (to chandler) joey smells gas!
what else is new?
yeah and we would go check it out, but you took away our keys.
well do something! get in there!
how? i guess i could break down your door.
yeah! do that!
and-and you will not blame us for any damage? (gives phoebe a thumbs up.)
no! (pause) are you doing it?! i do not hear anything! come on!
uh, okay I will-I will-I will break it down. (he hands the phone to phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)
oh hey hi, he is doing it. he is breaking down the door. (the chair breaks in half.) okay, we are in. (she hangs up the phone.)
(sighs) if i said i was, would you judge me?
okay. (the nurse exits.) oh man, i swear if they sold these at pottery barn…
hi!
(shocked) hi!
uh we-we need to talk.
uh-uh-uh, right now? because I have kind of got an el fresco situation going on over here.
please, please i want to apologize for the way i acted earlier today.
okay ross that is fine, but can you please stand near my head?
what? oh yeah. (he moves next to her head.) I am sorry. i mean i-i think i went a little crazy. i mean i was thinking about myself when i (wanders towards rachel’s feet) really—i should have been thinking about you rach…
okay. head ross! head ross! head ross!
right! right! i just—i want you to know that I am going to be there through this whole thing, okay? okay? the doctor’s appointments, the uh, the lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment—although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
what married?
well yeah, i think we should get married.
what, because that is your answer to everything?
no, because that is the right thing to do.
yeah, maybe if you are in love. but ross, we are not in love, are we?
no but…but still you can not possibly do this alone.
excuse me?
come on rach, you can not even eat alone in a restaurant.
what?!
I am just saying if you can not eat by yourself, how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
i can too eat by myself!
when have you ever?
when certain people leave the table and i am not finished!
well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
oh please, you inhale your food!
i grew up with monica! if you did not eat fast you did not eat!!
oh no dr. long, please come in. this is ross, he is the father.
but not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
(to rachel, standing by her feet) i do not know why you can not admit that you need me.
i do need you! i need you to stand near my head!
oh my god.
wow. there it is, i see it.
okay.
thank you.
pretty amazing huh?
i do not see it!
what? what?!
i can not see it!
you-you just said that you did!
i know, i lied! i did not want her to think i was a terrible mother! i can not even see my own baby!
oh sure, come here! (sits her up) sure you can! uh, look come here look, (rolls the machine closer) it is-it is-it is, it is right there (points).
oh. oh, it is beautiful. i see it now.
do you really?
no, i do not see it!
come on! come on! here, okay-okay, you see this? (points) this tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
yeah.
sweetie that is it.
that is it? well i saw that! ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.
you are welcome.
wow! i can not believe that is our baby.
yeah, that is our baby.
hi.
hey!
hey! so how was the doctor?
oh, everything went great.
good.
oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
oh.
i do not see the baby. where is it?
oh no, i know i could not see it either at first, but it is right umm… (starts to cry) ross, i lost it again.
oh. (he takes the picture and hugs her.
buh-bye. (hangs up the phone) i just got us reservations at michelle’s and tickets to the musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
betrothed… (corrects him)
…betrothed couple.
(entering carrying a skull) hey!
hey!
haaaa... (puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!
pheebs?
huh?
skull?
oh, yeah, it is my mom's.
(freaking out) oh my god!!
no, no, no. it is not! it is not my mom. it belonged to mom. yeah, no, she used to put it out every christmas to remind us, that even though it is christmas, people still die. and, you can put candy in it. (she grabs the skull, pulls out a stick of licorice, and takes a bite.)
(entering) hey!
(offering ross the skull) licorice?
(thinking it over) sure! (takes one) hey, i just found out, i get ben for the holidays this year.
are you going to dress up as santa?
nope. i mean, i know susan does every year, but i think i want to take this year to teach him all about hanukkah.
and maybe i could teach ben about the christmas skull and how people die.
you may need to use this year to teach ben about phoebe.
hmm.
hey. (he exits)
(to monica) did you know he was in there?
no.
how long have we been home?
about a half an hour.
lovely!
hey, you know what i was thinking? when we get married, are you going to change your last name to bing?
no.
why not?
bing's weird.
(entering) oh, hey, you guys!
hey!
hey!
hey. guess what! my landlord just called and my apartment is going to get ready soon, so i guess I will be moving out.
ahh, phoebe, I am going to miss you!
yes, you will be very sad. all right, well i got to go tell rachel the good news.
ohh! you guys going to be living together again?
yeah, why not?
well, she is just so much fun with joey, i just assumed, she would still be living with him.
why do you think, she is having so much fun living with joey?
no reason, except…she…told…me.
really? so she said, she did not want to live with me anymore?
no! no, she did not say that. i-i-i think you should talk to monica now.
phoebe, do not worry about it. I am sure she wants to live with you.
you are sure? you are absolutely sure?
well, no. but, um, i bet she probably does.
probably? yeah, i do not like that word. (chandler and monica look surprised) kind of what ‘probably’ really means. yeah, uh-huh. yeah, oh, "your mom probably will not kill herself," y’know? I am sorry, but I am not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on-on "probably!" y’know? you got to take care of yourselves! (she starts to walk out) in this world history teaches us nothing! (exits)
bing does not seem so weird now, does it?
(entering) hey!
hey! great, you are home! guess what phoebe got me for christmas! (starts drumming.)
drums?
(yelling) no! drums!
(to the maitre d') hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (laughs.)
I am sorry. but not that sorry, because you do not have to live with it. um, we have a reservation under the name chandler bing.
forty-five minutes? we have tickets to the musicman at 8:00.
is this because of the burrito thing?
(pulling chandler away from the maitre d') you need to give him money.
give him money? it was a joke!
no, to get a table! places like are always shakin’ you down. everybody wants to be paid off.
right, calm down, of'mally. I will slip him some money.
you have got to be smooth about it.
hey, i can be smooth. (walks back to the maitre d', very smoothly) listen, we are a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I would appreciate it. (shakes his hand)
okay. (walks back to monica)
how did it go?
had the money in the wrong hand. (shows her his left hand with the money in it)
wooooooo, hehehe. hey, ahh, you do not feel like you are going to throw up, do ya?
well, i do, so let us... (ben and ross sit down on the couch) so, ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, do not ya?
yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
yes, but also (pauses to let ben answer, but he does not.) hanukkah! see, you are part jewish, and-and hanukkah is a jewish holiday.
right, um, but, on hanukkah, hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. see, years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees.
(interrupts him) okay, that is right, yes, but on hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh (sings) dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, i made you out of clay.
(interrupts him again) okay, it is not a contest.
well, how about this year, instead of santa, we have fun celebrating hanukkah?
no! oh, no-no-no. hey, you were not bad, you have been very good, ben.
no, hey-hey, come on, (he grabs ben and sits him on his lap) ben, santa is not mad at you, okay? hey, you are-you are his favorite little guy!
(disappointed) yes! santa's coming!
it is easy! just keep it casual! give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!
how do you know so much about this?
i do not know.
richard used to do it, did not he?
we would be eating our soup right now.
mustached bastard…
(sees two people exit) okay, those people just left, come on! quick! give him the money and get their table!
(walks up to the maitre d') excuse me...
(finds his money) ahh-hahaha! (turns around to give the maitre d' his money, but he is not there anymore)
(stopping at phoebe’s entrance) ha!
so you like the drums! that is, that is great! y’know, i was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. all right, okay, well, apparently not! so, yay!
hey-hey, pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song. (to rachel) ready? one, two, three, four...
that is fun. (she exits disappointedly.)
thank you gunther, put it there. (he gets up, and shakes gunther's hand. a bunch of coins fall out his hand. he sits down next to monica.) definitely not easier with coins. (joey gets up and picks up the coins. chandler thinks, joey is just helping him to pick them up.) thank you.
thank you. (he gets up and puts on his jacket.) (phoebe enters) hey pheebs!
hey!
here. (gives her the coins) now i only owe you $49.50.
hey pheebs!
hey! (she sits down next to him)
if you want to give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
it is not just the drum noise. every five minutes, joey throws his sticks in the air, and i have to hear, "oh my eye! oh god, my eye!" i mean, it is so annoying.
yes, thank you. you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
phoebe, you got joey drums to annoy rachel, so she would not want to live there anymore?
maybe on some level.
joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
what is rock 'n' roll about that?
(entering with an aquarium covered by a towel) hey, joey, i got you another present. (she puts it on the counter)
oh wait, before you tell me what it is! (he plays a drum-roll) okay, what is it?
it is a…tarantula! (joey almost falls down from his drum-stool jumping up) oh! god! rachel, look, I am sorry. what was i thinking giving joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
what are you talking about? i love them! (looks into the cage) yeah, i had a tarantula when i was a kid. but it-it died, because my cat ate it. and then, then my cat died. but joey, is not this cool?
is it on me? i feel, i feel like it is on me! i got, hey! (he storms into his room)
oh, is not that adorable? joey is afraid of the tarantula.
(sarcastic) ah, yeah, he is so adorable, god, he is just so much fun, joey is the best, I am glad you are having so much fun here. (she turns around, about to leave)
what? wait-wait a minute, what? phoebe, what is the matter?
our apartment is ready.
and that makes you angry because…
because you would rather live here with joey.
where did you get that?
monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here. and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is going to change that.
phoebe?
hm?
did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!
(nods along) fish!
it would not have mattered anyway, phoebe, you and i are, are going to live together, we are roommates; that is the deal.
yes, but i wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you are having so much fun over here…
oh, it is so much more fun with you.
we did have fun, did not we?
we did!
oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
oh, i would love to!
yay, okay!
good, good, good, good, good. (she runs to the drums and gets the sticks)
great, all right, okay, and monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
(with the sticks in her hands) um... (she goes to the tarantula-cage and puts the sticks into it) done!
hey!
no, these are my pants.
well, uh, do you have a santa-outfit left?
okay look, do-do, you have anything christmassy? i promised my son, and i really do not want to disappoint him, um, come on, i…uh, you got to have something.
I am the holiday armadillo! I am a friend of santa's and he sent me here to wish you (points to ben) a merry christmas!
what happened to santa, holiday armadillo?
(to monica) santa was unavailable so close to christmas.
wow, come in, have a seat. you must be exhausted coming all the way from…texas.
that is right, ben. I am santa's representative for all the southern states. and mexico! but, santa sent me here to give you these presents, ben. (he tries to bend down to pick up the bag with the presents, but can not because of the costume) maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
you are welcome, ben. merry christmas, ooh, and happy hanukkah!
(gasps) you are? me, too!
because armadillos also wandered in the desert?
(to monica) you want to wander in the hall? (to ben) ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
yeah!
come on ben.
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...
(entering in a santa costume) ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!
hey! (grunts as ben hits him at full speed.)
what are you doing here, santa?
well, I am here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?
I am the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?
what?
you bet i did, ben, put it there! (he shakes ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to monica) well, it would have worked this time, if his hands were not so damn small! (realizes, that ben is standing right there) ho, ho, ho!
okay ben, why do not you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo, and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there is a sentence, i never thought I would say.
(to chandler) what are you doing?
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!
thank you, but, but you got to leave.
why?
because, I am finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you are-you are wrecking it.
but i did not get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I am sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me.
fine, I will give the suit back.
(to chandler) hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (she has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling chandler's beard.)
santa? really?
yes, is that okay?
did your dad ever dress up like santa?
no.
then it is okay! (they kiss.)
okay ben, santa has to go. say good-bye!
because, if santa and the holiday…armadillo? (ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas!
fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay.
well, I will stay, but only because i want to hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah?
all right, it is time for the story of hanukkah. years and years ago, there were these people called the maccabees.
(entering wearing a superman costume) merry christmas!
oh wow! look at this place!
oh, this is terrible. oh, they have made so many changes i can not even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—ooh! new sconces!
(yelling from another room) oh my god!
what?
(returning) okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
yeah?
and remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
yeah?
do you really not know where I am going with this? (phoebe nods, "no.") it left! it is one huge room!
oh no! (she runs to see.) (running back, excitedly) oh! wow!!!
see?
well, i guess we will just have to put the wall back up.
you can not, because of the new skylight!
there is a skylight?! (runs to see and yells from the bedroom.) wow!!
so what should we do? should we start looking for a new place?
(returning slowly) y’know I am-I am sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
oh yeah? startin’ to feel her again there are we?
a little bit, yeah.
pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
you heard her too?! you have the gift!
phoebe, it is okay. i like living with joey.
are you sure?
oh please, i hate packing, it is closer to work, and we do have fun. although, I am really going to miss living with you.
oh me too.
i know. (they hug.) oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? listen, I am gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair?
no, i do not hear that.
…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should have just lasted just one day, burned for…
that is right, and that is why we celebrate hanukkah today. the end.
yeah?
my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt. (glaring at joey who is nodding.)
the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! okay ben, it is time to light the hanukkah candles! (santa, superman, monica, ben, and the holiday armadillo go over to the menorah to light the candles.)
(entering with phoebe) hey!
oh.
(seeing the collection of characters.) wow! it looks like the easter bunny’s funeral in here.
come on, come on, we are-we are-we are lighting the candles!
oh.
oh.
okay, i understand why superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the easter bunny’s funeral?
i got it!
(yelling from the bedroom) is it back in the cage?
its back in cage!
cage closed?
joey, would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
(excited) guys, guys, I have got great news! guess what…
uh, ah, monica's pregnant?!
(shocked) really? (she looks around, suddenly embarrassed) let us get past the moment.
what is your news?
thank you. i got a job in advertising. (everybody cheers)
(hugging chandler) oh, honey, that is incredible!
(inquisitive) gosh, what is the pay like? (everybody stares at her indignantly) oh, come on people… (defending) come on, now, if i do not know who makes the most, how do i know who i like the most! (she looks at joey) hey joey! (joey winks at her)
actually, it pays nothing. it is an internship.
oh, that is cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'.
right. so, it will be the same except… less sex with you. (joey nods)
so, uh, what kind of stuff do you think they will have you do there?
well, it is a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
(enthusiastic) that is great.
yeah, i mean, there is probably going to be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating
(grinning awkwardly) humiliating and noble!
you know, if i did not already have a job, i think, i would have been really good in advertising.
ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
yes, i did, i did! (he turns to joey, disappointed) i should have written it down!
(entering) hey!
hey!
where is chandler? i want to wish him good luck on his first day. (monica smiles) ... and i smelled bacon. (taking some)
he just left.
(puzzled) who did? (monica looks bewildered)
(entering) joey! you never going to believe it: she called.
(standing up, surprised) she did?
(enthusiastic) you got it!
(still surprised) i did?
what is she talking about?
i do not know, but it sounds great.
your agent called. you got that audition.
with lennart haze?
yes.
oh my god, that is great! that is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
is it a good play?
well, it must be, because i read and i did not understand a singe word.
yeah, and lennart haze is starring in it…
yeah, yeah, and directing.
(sighs) he was so good in that movie of macbeth.
(disbelieving) you saw that?
no, but… i saw the previews. they played it right before jackass.
yeah, he is done some amazing works.
oh, yeah. oh, i loved him in those cell phone commercials.
(almost laughing) i know. when the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. (they all laugh)
hey! maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
(sitting down) do not make me more nervous than i already am!
(entering) good morning, everybody.
oh, no, no, I am an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that i can rent a car.
yeah, well, I am kind of heading into a new career direction and, you know, you got to start at the bottom.
right. look, i know I am a little bit older than you guys, but it is not like I am bob hope (he sits down)
the comedian? uso?!
it is so amazing to meet you. (they are shaking hands) I am such a big fan of your work.
tell me about it! "unlimited nights and weekends!"
no, i-i-i was not making fun of you, honestly, i-i think you were great in those commercials.
yeah.
(regaining confidence) are you kiddin'? when they shoot you out of that cannon…
wow!
oh, yah, sure.
err, "i think you know".
"i am what you made me. you know what? i could go right now."
"i can not. oh, i want to, long pause, but i can not."
(understandingly) oh, oh, i thought that was your character's name, you know, i thought you were like an indian or something, you know with a… (he mimes wearing a feather on his head)
ah, y-y-you are sure you do not want me to do it again? i could do it with an accent, you know, southern (he speaks in what he believes is a southern accent) "i could go right now, maaan!"
(interrupting their conversation) ah, hi, ah. thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what i did wrong, I would just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. and, and also: (to producer #1) 'how you doing?' (to lennart again) you should, please, just give me another chance. i really want to get better, please.
yeah.
i really doubt that.
(suggesting) could not i just sleep with the producer?
hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight?
oh, i can not. I have got a date with that waitress, katy, yeah, i know we have been only going out like twice, but i have a really good feeling about her.
oh, i hear divorce bells.
(taken aback) what?
of-ok. just relax, phoene, just stay calm. (he searches his coat and freaks out). oh my god, i can not find my wallet.
no.
(still in a high-pitched voice) what do you mean "no"? i knew you would be my death, phoebe buffay.
lowell, is that you?
(simultaneously) oh my god!
(excited) I am sorry, ross, this is my old friend lowell from the streets. lowell, ross.
yeah, a real pleasure.
ah, it is been so long, so long. (they hug again) i can not believe you are still doing this!
good for you!
ouh… (she nods)
(shocked) oh my god. phoebe, you used to mug people?
excuse me, ross, old friends catching up…
hey, how did the audition go?
well, they want to see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, lennart haze did not like me. (he sits down)
what happened?
well, he said i was not urgent enough, you know, and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical. oh, and he said that i should think less.
so far so good! (joey nods)
(entering, carrying a large box) honey, I am old!
(standing up, walking towards him) what is wrong?
i am so much older than these other interns. i can not compete with them.
so you are a little older. try to look at the positive: you have all this life experience.
yes, but i do not think life experience with these. (he opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)
wooooooooow (he takes the sneaker) it is like they are on fire!
what are they? (they sit down again)
they are these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can not do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
(determined) i give you $ 500 for them!
what am i supposed to do with these?
ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time.
well, first of all, they are not called "sneakers" anymore. apparently, they are called "kicks" or "skids" and i think i heard somebody say "slorps". (he takes a sneaker) and here, look: they have got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! (to monica) would you help me try to sell these?
okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
no, i do not think that is the kind of thing they are looking for.
hey, that would work on me! why did i get to buy mrs. butterwords?
hey, you will never guess what just happened… phoebe and i got mugged!
you okay?!
(sitting down) yah, because phoebe knew the mugger!
(bewildered) how do you know a mugger?
I am sorry i have friends outside the six of us.
you want to know how she knew him? (he points at phoebe) because phoebe used to mug people.
(shocked) seriously?
well, I am not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i…
(disapproving) phoebe, that is awful!
well, ok, i was not rich like you guys, ok, i did not eat gold and have a flying pony… i had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…
you are mother killed herself!
she was a drug dealer!
well, anyway, it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him, because (menacingly) i was about to do some serious damage!
(laughing) okay…
well, this must have brought back some really bad memories for you, ross.
why?
well, ross was mugged as a kid.
(worried) you were?
yeah, it was pretty traumatic. i was outside st. marc's comics… you know, i-i-i was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kind of trouble spiderman got into that week-
(coughing) wonderwoman!
anyway, i was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone… (he looks at monica) … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "give me your money, punk!"
(shocked) oh my god…
i know! and-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book: "science boy"
oh yeah! what was his superpower again?
a superhuman thirst for knowledge.
that is it.
well, i-i better get to class (he stands up) are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way, phoebe?
no… actually, you might want to stay away from jane street… that is where stabby joe works.
okay, i think we have a problem here.
what?
well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, i, uhm, i worked st. marc's comics.
yeah?
well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
so?
well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
oh my god!
i know… i mugged ross!
(entering) i know, I am sorry, but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
but I am bursting with you-hu!
actually, i really need…
yes… ahahaaa (he seems to be in pain)
(walking on the spot) "i think you know!"
"i am what you made me! you know what?"
"i could go right now."
(urgent) "i, oh, i can not. i want to, but i can not!"
(disbelieving) i did?
sure, yeah. i do not have time to say thank you because i really got to go. (he grabs his jacket and limps out of the room)
hey!
hey!
what are you doing?
putting on the sneakers… thought I would get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…
oh, anything yet?
yes, how is this: they are so uncomfortable it is like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
(entering) hey!
probably want to know what I am doing…?
no, that seems about right.
yesterday at my audition, i really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. i got a call-back, so I am drinking everything. oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
joey, that was formula.
we got to get more of that. (he leaves the apartment)
(sitting on the couch) you know what… these are not half-bad! (to rachel) you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren.
okay, first of all, that is stupid and second of all, I am not allowed to talk to ralph.
alright (he stands wearing the sneakers on) i feel youger already!
(on the floor) yah, i think i broke my hip.
(spotting ross) hey, you!
hey!
hey, how was class?
no one ever asked me that, what is wrong?
nothing, i really want to know.
oh… (he looks positively surprised) well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene…
(interrupting) alright, nothing is worth this. uhm, i have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…
(disbelieving) wh-what are you talking about? it was not a girl. it was this huge dude.
you do not have to lie anymore, ross, i know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
no, it was not.
yes, it was.
no, it was not. you do not think i would have defended myself against a fourteen year-old…
(interrupting, pinching his year) "give me your money, punk!"
(shocked) oh my god, it was you! i can not believe it, you… you mugged me?
(apologetic) yeah, and I am so, so sorry, ross, I am sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it is kind of neat. (she smiles at him, but he does not understand) i mean, well, it is just that i I have always felt kind of like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and i have… have a great one!
it is not the best!
i know, I am sorry, please forgive me. i do not know what to say…
(indignant) there is nothing you can say. that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
really? even more humiliating than…
(interrupting) hey, let us not do this!
okay… (he stands up) you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he is about my age…
a-huh. so he is rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "not suitable for adults!"
oh, thank you, sir… or man-who is-two-years-younger-than-me (he sits down again)
(over-enthusiastic) i do not know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
the cold weather hurts my hip!
hey, ross! (he lowers his newspaper and scowls at her) i know you are still mad at me, but can i just talk to you for a second?
sure, go ahead. whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead. (he raises his hands as if being mugged)
i just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something i think you will find very exciting.
(faking enthusiasm) oh my god, crap from the street? (she smiles excitedly, but ross just turns back to his newspaper)
look, ross, in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell… or smoke. (ross looks at her in astonishment) anyway, i was looking through it and i found "science boy" (she holds up some sheets of paper and hands them to ross)
oh my god. (he sighs) i never thought I would see this again. (he browses trough the pages) it is all here. what made you save it all these years?
i can not say, i just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.
you really thought "science boy" was worth saving!
yeah… but you should know, i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
still… this is amazing… oh my god, thank you, phoebe.
you are welcome. and thank you for "science boy". i learned a lot from him
you are welcome.
(hoping frantically on the spot, screaming) "i need an answer!"
"you know!"
"i need an answer now!"
(screaming) oh!
"you knew this all along and you never told me? you never told me? i can never forgive you, i can never forgive myself, i have nothing to live for – bang – end scene!"
(in pain) oh thanks, thanks! now, i really have to get…
wow, that is a big cable bill! huh, you do not have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a saturday afternoon?! (shocked) i was in the house!
(entering) hey, uhm, phoebe did not by any chance mention that…
… that she was the huge guy that mugged you? yah.
i see. you did not happen to tell…
… everybody we know? yeah.
great. thanks! (he leaves)
all right! here we go! 1999! the year of joey!
(deadpan, standing next to monica) we are very happy for you.
what is the matter?!
we wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know…
all right, I will take care of it.
oh no, wait! joey!
(hopping) 73! 72! 71!
ross! ross! ross, listen! who are you kissing at midnight, huh? rachel or phoebe?
what?
well you got to kiss someone, you can not kiss your sister.
well, who is going to kiss my sister.
chandler.
awww, man! really?
dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or chandler?
that is a good point.
yeah.
oh well, since i have that whole history with rachel, i guess phoebe.
okay, great!
all right.
pheebs! pheebs! ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
it is so obvious, why does not he just ask?
rach! rach! listen, I am going to kiss you at midnight.
what?!
well, everyone is got to kiss someone. you can not kiss ross you got the history.
so?
so? who would you rather have kiss you, me or chandler?
oh, good point.
yeah!
(to monica) happy new year!
happy new year.
(to phoebe) happy new year, pheebs!
you too!
(to joey) happy new year, joey!
so did that do anything for ya?
y'know what? I am going to go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
but your divorce is not even final yet.
just the one divorce in '99! y'know what, i am going to be happy this year. i am going to make myself happy.
do you want us to leave the room, or?
everyday i am going to do one thing that i have not done before. that my friends is my new year's resolution.
ooh! that is a good one! mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
that is good one too, pheebs. now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who is resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane.
she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
in fact, I will bet you 50 bucks that you can not go the whole year without making fun of us. eh, y'know what, better yet? a week.
I will take that bet my friend. and you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!" (ross looks at him.) and it starts right now!
all right, my new year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
ohh.
really?! how come?
well, y'know those special skills i have listed on my resume? i would love it would be great if one of those was true.
do you want me to teach you? I am a great teacher.
really? who-who have you taught?
well, i taught me and i love me.
yeah that would be great! thanks pheebs!
op, look! claire forgot her glasses! and she is going to be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, i hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I am talking about.
hey rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
i do not gossip!
well, maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y'know kind of like a public service, it does not mean I am a gossip. i mean, would you call ted kopel a gossip?
well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, i would.
what? they were like this!
okay! (she leaves.) (to chandler and joey.) hey!
i just asked that girl out.
nice!
nice!! yeah! is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
yes it is. see. (shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)
(reading it) elizabeth hornswoggle?
that is right, uh, elizabeth hornswoggle.
horn-swoggle.
you all right chandler? is there something funny about that name?
no. no, i just think that maybe i-I would heard it somewhere before. (sits down rubbing his temple.)
oh really! where? somewhere funny I would bet! (chandler is straining to keep quiet as phoebe enters.)
hi, pheebs!
hey!
oh-oh, guess what? i-i have a date with elizabeth (talking into chandler's ear.) hornswoggle.
hornswoggle? (to chandler) ooh, this must be killing you.
all right, see you later.
see ya! all right pheebs, i am ready for my first lesson.
okay. (joey tries to take the guitar.) oh no-no-no, you do not touch the guitar! first you learn here, (points to her head.) then you learn here. (points to the guitar.)
umm, okay.
okay, lesson one: chords. now, i do not know the actual names of the chords but umm, i-i-i made up names for the way my hand looks while I am doing them. (she starts to show joey the chords. transcribers note: for this one you will have to use your imagination, because it would take me 50 pages to describe each one. so if you want to see them, you will have to wait for this episode to come to a tv near you.) (holding up her hand and then reconfiguring her hand with each name.) so then, this is bear claw. okay, umm, turkey leg and old lady. (joey tries to imitate them.)
what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. y'know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.
hey everybody, rachel was so good today. she did not gossip at all.
i did not! even when i found out…umm, all right, well let us just say i found something out something about someone and let us just say she is going to keep it. (goes into her room.)
hey, pheebs! check-check this out. (holds up his hand in one of phoebe's chords.)
ooh, you nailed the old lady! (they both laugh at what she said.)
yeah listen so, i thought i was getting better, so on my way home today i stopped by this guitar store and…
did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? did you?!
no.
give me your hands. (he does and she smells his left hand.) strings. give me it! (he gives her his right hand and she smells it as well.) pick. do you want to learn to play guitar?
yes!
then do not touch one!!
(entering, with ben) hi!
hi ben!
(notices something) ross is wearing leather pants! does nobody else see that ross is wearing leather pants? (pause, no one speaks.) someone comment on the pants!
i think they are very nice.
i like  them.
yeah! (chandler bangs the table in frustration.)
i like them a lot.
that is not what i had in mind! see, people like ross do not generally wear these types of pants. you see, they are very tight. (motions to ross's buttock.) maybe there is something in that area.
oh see, i-i needed a new thing for today and there is this leather store that always smells so good and i thought to myself, "wow, (to chandler) i never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
oh come on!! (storms out.)
(after he is left) okay, seriously, what do you think?
you look like a freak.
awful, absolutely awful. (plus other negative comments from phoebe and monica.)
what are you, what are you doing?
it is my new year's resolution!
what, to blind my child?
no! to take more pictures of all of us together. i mean i really think it is the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
well, everyone will enjoy my music as well. (does a chord and monica starts taking pictures of him and phoebe. they both start to strike a pose with the excessive amount of pictures that monica takes.)
(talking to himself) my god! these pants are burning up! (he is still wearing the leather pants.) (she snuggles closer.) oh come on, she wants to snuggle now! what is she trying to kill me? it is like a volcano in here! (out loud.) are you hot?
okay, it must just be me then.
that was just the pants on the couch. umm, hey, do you, do you mind if i use your bathroom?
thanks. (gets up and as he does so, the sound returns. without another word he heads into her bathroom.)
(in ecstasy) ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….
'kay!
oh my god!
tiger! (joey moves his hand in an attempt to do the chord, in fact he does it with each name.) dragon! iceberg!! (he fails.) joseph, did you even study at all last night?
yes! yes, i did.
then do iceberg!
(thinks) (quietly) g-sharp.
g-sharp? have you been studying the real names of the chords? (joey does not answer.) have you? (he looks away in shame.) oh my god!
what?! i did not touch a guitar!
no, but you are questioning my method!
no, I am not questioning it, I am saying it is stupid! (notices monica standing between them and smiling.) what?! (the camera clicks, taking another picture.)
thank you. (leaves.)
y'know none of my other student thought i was stupid.
your other student, was you!
yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
(looking in the yellow pages) look, maybe i need to try a real teacher! right here! here! andy cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there is a nice picture of him with a little kid and the kid's got a guitar!!!!!! (storms out.)
fine! you go learn from your qualified instructor! but do not come crying to me when everyone is sick and tired of hearing you play bad, bad leroy brown!!
(entering, singing) "baddest man in the whole damn town."
oh, fine! take his side! (storms out.)
(on phone) i can not wait to be with you! I will sneak over as soon as ross picks up ben. I will just tell rachel I am going to be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
(on phone) laundry. huh. is that my new nickname? (rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
(on phone) awww, y'know what your nickname is, mr. big…
arghh!! (she quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
(answering phone) hello?
(calling from elizabeth's bathroom) joey, it is ross! i need some help!
uhh, chandler's not here.
well, you can help me!
okay.
listen, I am in elizabeth's bathroom…
nice!
no, i-i got really hot in my leather pants so i took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. look, i-i can not put them back on. i can not!
oh. that is quite a situation. uh, do you see any like, powder?
powder! yeah! yeah, i have powder! (grabs some of her shelf.)
good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it will absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
yeah, okay, hold on! (he puts the phone down and proceeds to spread a large amount of powder on his legs and makes another attempt at pulling up his pants. it does not work, and without picking up the phone leans down to it.) (almost in tears.) they are not coming on man.
umm, do you see any—oh, vaseline?
ohh, i-i see lotion, i have lotion! will that work?
yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.
hold on.
ross? you okay?
they are still, they are still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
really?! uhh, what color is it?
what difference does that make?!
well, I am just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she will not know the difference!
(entering) joey, do you have a minute?
dude, what am i going to…
(to ross) uh, rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out. (he hangs up the phone and strands ross in the bathroom.)
oh, joey, i have such a problem!
oh well, you are timing could not be better. i am putting out fires all over the place.
okay. okay. okay. joey, i have got to tell you something!
what-what is it, what is it?
oh my god, it is so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
oh no, no-no-no-no! i do not want to know!
yes! yes! yes, you do want to know! this is unbelievable!
i do not care, rach! look, i am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can not tell anyone!
what? what secrets? you know secrets? what are they?
and you are not supposed to be gossiping!!
i know, i know! i just can not keep this one in, so i pick up the phone… (joey in a childish attempt to not hear what rachel is about to say, puts his fingers in his ears and starts to scream loudly. rachel turns and walks out upon seeing that joey's not going to listen, and as she exits chandler walks in and sees joey in his current state.)
I am not listening to you!
all right, I am coming out. hey, can you turn the lights off.
i had a problem.
hey, pheebs?
no, i can not talk to you! i do not have a fancy ad in the yellow pages!
look, pheebs, i just, i want to apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. and-and i promise, i will not touch a guitar until you say I am ready. (after a short pause she hands him her guitar.) you really think I am ready?
uh-huh!
wow! cool! (he takes the guitar, stands up, and goes to play a note. however, while strumming it, he knocks it out of his hands and it bounces off the table and lands on the floor. phoebe just stares at the guitar.)
(sitting back down) was the chord at least right…
no!
oh my god!
we heard about your pants, I am so sorry.
this year was supposed to be great! but, it is only the second day and I am a loser with stupid leather pants that do not even fit!
look at me! (chandler squeaks in an attempt not to make fun of him.)
hey, hey, look. look ross, ben drew a picture of you! (shows him ben's picture.) huh? you are-you are a cowboy!
oh, be-because of the leather pants.
see? ben does not think you are a loser, he thinks you are a cowboy! now that is something.
yeah!
that really is something; that is really cool.
how do you partner!
maybe i should get another pair! ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. (chandler starts rubbing his temple again.) I am going to go kiss ben goodnight. (he starts to head for monica's bedroom.) i can not believe he thinks I am a cowboy. (pause.) i would make a good cowboy. (he struts into monica's room.)
okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, i think I am, I am going to go do my laundry.
oh yeah, me too. y'know if this shirt is dirty. (smells it.) yep.
okay, I am going to go too. I am going to go to the airport. i figure if i hang around there long enough, someone is bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
good luck, honey!
bye! (she exits, leaving rachel and joey alone.)
hey, uh, joey?
umm?
remember that big thing i was going to tell you about?
oh, no! (starts that screaming thing again. rachel stops him by pulling his fingers out of his ears.)
I am not going to tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. right?
well, then it would not be a secret. so yeah, that would be okay. yeah. yeah!
(quietly) yeah. well. (pause.) hey uh joe, would mind going over to chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
now? you want me to go over there now?
yeah!
do you know something?
do you know something?
i might know something.
i might know something too.
what is the thing you know?
oh no, i can not tell you until you tell me what you know.
i can not tell you what i know.
well then i can not tell you what i know.
okay, fine.
you do not know!
all right, how about i go over there and i will walk into chandler's bedroom and i will see that thing that i think that i know is actually the thing that i think that i know! (note: kudos to ms. aniston on the delivery of that line. she said it very quickly and did not screw up a word. try it yourself, it are not that easy.)
(gasps) you know!!!!
and you know!!!
yeah, i know!!!!
chandler and monica?!! oh, this is unbelievable!! how long have you known?
too long! oh my god, rach, I have been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! listen, listen, we can not say anything about this to anybody, they are so weird about that! listen… (phoebe returns and interrupts them.)
hey! it is raining. i do not want to fly in the rain. so…
oh, i am going to go for a walk in the rain.
ohhh, yeah, me too.
that is weird. (pause.) i bet they are doing it.
(entering) oh good, okay, i can not take it anymore. i can not take it anymore. so you win, okay? here! (hands him the 50 bucks he is about to owe him.) pheebs? flying a jet? better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! and ross, phone call for you today, tom jones, he wants his pants back! and hornswoggle? what are you dating a character from fraggile rock?! (he sits down and sighs in relief.)
are you kidding me?! joey. joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey! joey!!
(joining in, in his sleep) joey. joey. joey. joey! joey!!
oh. oh, did-did-did i wake you?
gunther, can i get another cup of coffee, please? (gunther starts to pour him another cup.) so uh, what do you do when you are not working here?
oh, okay, thanks. (he goes back to the couch and rejoins monica, joey, and phoebe.)
chandler, that is like your fourth cup of coffee!
well, i am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I am exhausted! because joey started snoring!
he is in a different room! he is really that loud?
(proudly) oh, you should here me.
it is not something to be proud of, okay? you have to go to a sleep clinic!
look, i told ya, I am not going to any clinic! i do not have a problem, you are the one with the problem! you should go to a "quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
they do not have those.
yeah, they do! quit being a baby and leave me alone! there, you have just had your first class!
y’know i used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever i started to snore, he would just roll me over…
ohhh, yeah!
he would just roll me over and i would stop snoring.
next time you snore, I am rolling ya over!
i got to do what i got to do, you got to do what you got to do, you just do it.
(entering) hey guys!
hey, all right!
hey!
oh, the olympics.

oh no, not yet.

oh. thanks. uh, has anyone seen rach?
ugh, she is upstairs not doing the dishes! and i tell ya something! I am not doing them this time! i do not care if those dishes sit in the sink until they are all covered with—I will do them when i get home!

I will pick it up for you!
thank you.
okay.
oh, she is got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses… (laughs and makes like indiana jones and his whip) wah-pah!

hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
yeah, yeah, i was just about to take a break anyways, so…
so listen uh, i know you and i have not really had a chance to talk since uh, emily and i decided to get married, and uh, i was just wondering how you were.
oh.
i know if you were getting married I would feel, kind of….. y’know.
yeah. yeah. definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I am okay.
yeah?
yeah.
all right, i just wanted to check.
oh, that is sweet.
you are great. and i-i know someday this will happen for you too. you just hang in there.
(breaking the hug) uhh, hang in there?
oh, no, i did not mean, uh…
i mean maybe you did not hear about a serious relationship called me and joshua?
oh, i thought you guys had just been on like four dates, i did not realise that had become anything, yet.
oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. oh no, those were four great dates.
oh. yeah?
yeah. oh, yeah. and i mean, the connection, i mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…
wow, that is-that is-that is incredible.
i know is not it? it is like I am right there with joshua.
uh-huh.
you are right there with emily. and it is y’know, it is kind of like…. it is a tie! well, i got to get, i got to get back to the dishes.
i got to get to work.
oh yeah? fine.
hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?
oh yeah, no, what is that?
if like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. uh, in fact emily’s coming into town this weekend, why do not you say we all have dinner? say, sunday night?
that would be great!
yeah, all right, it is a date. (he leaves)
(to the closed door) hang in there. you hang in there. (gives him the raspberry.)
(coming back in) did you say something?
no, just singing. (does a little song.)
oh my god! ohh! look at this one! it is so beautiful!
yeah, but y’know, about have of these are going to end up getting divorced.
oh, yes, umm, I am here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
emily waltham.
(laughs) okay.
you are the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.
i am, are not i?
yes?
all right. (goes to take off the dress.)
all right buddy, time to roll over. (rolls him over, and discovers a surprise) (looking down) no-no! (covers his eyes) no, no-n-n-n-no!! you are going to a clinic! you are going to a clinic, and a pyjama store!
does she use the cups? yes! i believe she does. does she use the plates? yes! i believe she does. (looks at the wedding dress and stops.)
oh. thank you. ohhh, thank you very much. oh, thank you for coming. (there is a knock on the door.) uh, just a second!
no-no, let me in!
phoebe?
yeah!
can you just hold on for one minute?
no, you have to let me in right now!!
are you alone?
yes!
all right.
this sucks! i did not know i had to stay up all night before i went to this stupid sleep clinic! I am so tired!
it is 6:00.
yeah, well…
(entering) hi!
hey, i hear that you and joshua are going out to dinner with ross and emily, and i think that is, i think that is really cool.
yeah, rach, i think you are handling that really well.
handling it? what do you mean, handling it? there is nothing to handle. now, maybe i would have a problem with this if it was not for me and joshua. y’know, they are not going to get married anyway!
what?
come on! they rushed into this thing so fast it is ridiculous! i mean, they are going to be engaged for like what? a year? and somewhere along the way, one of them is going to realise what they have done and they are call the whole thing off. I am telling ya, you are going to be dancing at my wedding before you are dancing at there is.
yeah, well, i do not dance at weddings.
why not?
because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when i dance, i look like this… (starts to dancing really, really, really badly. ross enters behind him and he stops.)
hey man.
hey!
so, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
nothing.
nothing.
i am… (looks in his date book.) free!
great! because emily and i are getting married in a month!
yep!
in a month?
yeah!
you mean, you mean 30 days?
yeah.
from now?
yeah.
well, that is great.
yeah! yeah, emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it is going to be torn down, so… i mean, i-i know it is crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and i do not know, this just feels right. y’know?
(still looking in date book) hey! that is the day after i stop menstruating! (they all look at him.) this is not mine.
hi!
ohh, nothing, i just wanted to see you. see you and hug you. (hugs him) see you.
yeah! (she sits down) sit!
I am more than okay, i am really, really happy! want to know why?
‘because i am really happy about us. i think we are, i think we are so on the right track! y’know? i mean, i think we are working, i think we are clicking. y’know?
yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where i—that i think we need—we would need to work on; i-i would think it was we are just not crazy enough!
well, yeah, right, y’know what? yeah, you are right, i mean, we no, we have our fun. yeah! but if (grunts uncomprehensively)……i mean, i mean like craaaazy! y’know? okay, all right. this is going to, this is going to sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. umm. ugh. what if we got married?
oh, i know, i know, it is-it is so, it is so totally like, "whoa! can we do this?" y’know, i mean, but i mean it just feels right! do not you think? it does! i mean, it just feels right, do not you think?
joey tribbiani.
(answering for him) yes he did.
(waking joey) hey, check out that girl! she is really hot!
(sleepily) yeah, she is. wow! (falls back asleep, loudly) how you doing?
what?!
you are coming on to the entire room! (he goes over to pick up a stack of magazines next to her, and to get her attention, he throws them back down.) I am chandler.
hi.
you mind if i…
so uh, what are you in for?
what a coincidence, i listen in my sleep.
(asleep) so why do not you give me your number?
okay, ready?
yeah.
okay.
(catching it) i got it! mine! (they both hug)
congratulations!
thank you!
okay! my turn! my turn!
okay! (gets into position) okay, ready?
(cocking her head from side to side in some pre-bouquet-catching ritual) yeah.
okay. (phoebe turns and throws it on the couch.)
(upset) that was a terrible throw!!
I am not going to right to you! that is not real!
look at me! my big concern is what is real?! (finally realises) oh my god. we are really sad, are not we?
yeah, i think we are.
this is not even my dress.
well, at least you did not rent yours from a store called, "it is not too late."
I am changing out of this.
me too.
in like a half-hour?
me too.
okay, throw it straight this time.
okay.
I am getting married next!!
yay!
i hate my regular clothes now! y’know? i look down and-and i know that this is not going to be the most special day of my life.
yeah. i mean it was kind of fun for a while, but did not you start feeling silly?
i guess.
oh my god!
oh god.
oh, you are such a cheater!
(entering) hello! little ones.
hey!
hey!
so, is joey going to stop snoring?
yep! and! a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (they are stunned.) joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
oh, how did that happen?
because I am cooler.
no, seriously.
well she is, she is the kind of girl—joey was unconscious.
(muffled by the mouth guard) hey you guys! what is happening?
oh my god!
what is that?
(muffled) oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it is going to help me not to snore.
well, are you asleep right now, joe? ‘because i do not think you have to wear it unless you are!
(takes out the mouth guard) i know i do not have too! it tastes good. (puts it back in.)
plus, you look cool.
(entering from her bedroom) well, i just called joshua…
oh, how did it go?
well, i did my best to convince him that I am not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I am just going through a hard time.
what did he say?
well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. ugh. i feel blue.
ohh, sweetie! (goes to comfort her.) hey, i bet you anything that he is going to call you again.
yeah, maybe, but i do not think i even care. i do not think he is the one I am sad about. y’know, i know that i said that i am totally okay with ross getting married, but as it turns out, i do not think I am handling it all that well.
yeah, maybe.
and i-i am just trying to figure out why.
any luck?
well, yeah, y’know how ross and i were on again, off again, on again, off again? i guess i just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
again. y’know what? i think we all did.
(entering) hey!
hey! (she jumps up and throws emily’s wedding dress into rachel’s room.)
so, i got us some reservations for sunday night, okay? how about, ernie’s at 9 of the clock?
yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
oh, see i-i do not know if we are going to be hungry at three.
three people. joshua’s not going to be there.
what happened?
uh, well, i think, i think he broke up with me.
noo. why?
well, apparently he scares easy.
oh, rachel, I am-I am sorry.
it is okay. sometimes, things do not work out the way you would thought they would.
come here.
(breaking the hug) oh, hey, do not you have to go pick up emily?
yeah.
yeah.
you okay?
yeah! i got my girls.
ugh. (she goes over and lays her head on phoebe’s lap.)
(looks at monica) hey, y’know what might cheer you up?
what?
y’know, i got to tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
oh, i wish there was a job where i could wear this all the time. (pause) maybe someday, there will be.
oh god! he is going to come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
oh, okay! (she goes to answer the door.)
no-no, rachel, do not get it! he can not see us!
no, yeah! the groom cannot see the bride!
I am not going to marry chandler!
not after this!
okay, you guys, just relax. (she goes over to open the door, and as she does, she says.) i doooo. (sees that it is joshua, not chandler that knocked on the door.)
oh, wait, joshua! joshua! (pause) (comes back inside) yeah, well, that oughta do it.
(muffled by the mouth guard) dude! i am trying to sleep! (shrugs to say, "what is up with that?")
(lying on a beach towel, recapping what happened in the last episode) okay, so we went to the beach, because phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and i do not really know what happened with that.
ehh?
(voice-over) oh, and then monica joked that she would not go out with a guy like chandler...
(to monica) (in a funny voice) hi there. (monica turns her head away in disgust)
(voice-over) ...and he could not let it go, and... i do not really know what happened with that either.
(voice-over) oh-oh! and then ross’s new girlfriend, bonnie, shows up and rachel convinced her to save her head. and then ross and rachel kiss, and now ross has to choose between rachel and the bald girl and i do not know what happened there either...
y'know what, hold on, let me go get chandler. (gets up and leaves.)
(surprised) hi!
awww.
oh, you are welcome a million.
yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses rachel.)
(softly) oh my god.
i know.
(stopping suddenly and getting up) okay, i got to go.
whoa! what?! why?!
well, i-i got to go break up with bonnie.
here?! now?!
well, yeah. i can not-i can not stay here all night, and if i go in there she is-she is going to want to... do stuff.
well, can not you tell her that you are not in the mood?
no, she likes that. yeah. faking sleep does not work either, i can not tell you how many mornings i woke up with her...
(interrupting) whoa-ho.
whoa-oh, okay! yeah, why am i telling you that?
i do not know.
yeah, yeah. (opens the door) it was not every morning.
oh, making it worse!
okay.
i-i mean i, well i think i can figure it out. i guess y'know i was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
how close?
i do not even know how that would work!
(interrupting) I am not asking!
yeah. let us see, my had mom killed herself, and my dad had run off, and i was living in a gremlin with a guy named cindy who talked to his hand.
yeah, well, everybody does! I am a really cool person. and y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you did not even try! y'know what, you walked out on me, and I am just, I am going to do the same thing to you.
i do not ever want to see you again!
(walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) umm, where is my purse?
(closing the fridge in disgust) shoot! we are out of soda.
(jumping up) oh, I will go out and get you some.
really?!
nope! because I am not your boyfriend. (to phoebe, who is entering) hey pheebs, how did it go?
well, umm, my mom’s friend, phoebe, is actually my birth mom.
i found a dried up seashores.
sweety, what are you talking about?
oh, my new mom, who-who is a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)
whoa, wait, pheebs, wait a second! do not you want to stay here and talk about it?
no. I am just, i want to, i need to be alone.
(turning around, insistently) monica!
oh.
it is over.
oh, was it awful?
well, it was loong. i did not even realise how late it was, until i noticed the 5 of the clock shadow on her head. (they both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) anyway, she did not want to stay. i called a cab; she just left.
i wrote you a letter.
ohh! thank you! i like mail. (he goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)
(handing him the letter) it is just some things I have been thinking about. some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, i just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
okay. (he leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) wow, it is-it is 5:30 in the morning. (rachel laughs) so, I would better get cracking on this baby.
well, I will be waiting for you, just come up when you are done.
okay, I will be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. front and back. very exciting.
oh. (looks at his watch) oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)
(coming down the stairs) hey! (ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) what happened to you? why did not you come up?
done!
you just finished?
well, i wanted to be thorough. i mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! and so i wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
so umm, does it?
I am sorry.
does it?
does it? does it? yeah, i wanted to give that whole ‘does it?’ part just another glance.
what are you talking about, ross, you just said that you read it twice! look, y'know what, either it does or it does not, and if you have to even think about it...
(interrupting) no, rach, no. i do not, i do not, i do not have to think about it, in fact, I have decided, I have decided that, that it.......does.
are you sure?
oh, sure! I am sure.
i know. (hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)
all right, there is a nuclear holocaust, I am the last man on earth. would you go out with me?
ennnh.
I have got canned goods.
(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) hey, you guys! take a look at this! (chandler and monica jump up and go over to the hole.) check this baby out, dug me a hole!
excellent hole, joe.
oh no! no!! my hole!!
(screaming in pain) ow!! ow!!!
(climbing out of the hole) what?! what?!! what is it?!
jellyfish sting! oh, it hurts! it hurts!! it hurts!!
well, can we help?! you want us to take you back to the house?!
it is like two miles!
yeah, and I am a little tired from digging the hole.
oh damn the jellyfish. damn all the jellyfish!
we have got to do something!
well, there is really only one thing you can do.
what?! what is it?!
you are going to have to pee on it.
what?!! gross!!
do not blame me, i saw it on the discovery channel.
y'know what, he is right. there is something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
well forget it! it does not hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!
if you want some privacy you can use my hole.
well, I am ready to get the hell out of here! (sees ross and rachel cuddling on the couch.) oh. are you? are you?!! (they nod ‘yes.’) ohh! that is so great!! ooh, not for bonnie. (they nod ‘no.’) but for you, yay! ohh.
hey!
how was the beach?
nothing, i do not know.
what happened?
nothing. I am going to take a shower.
me too!!
me too.
okay, I am going to put this (her suitcase) in the car.
ooh, i have to go pack. (gets up to do so.) it really does?
it does. it really and truly does.
(finding the part) (looks up in disgust) it so does not!!!
she wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. i mean she goes on for five pages about, about how i was unfaithful to her! (both joey and chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”well...”) (yelling) we were on a break!!!!!
oh my god! if you say that one more time, I am going to break up with you!
fine! fine! but this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “if you accept full responsibility...” (to chandler and joey) full responsibility! “...i can begin to trust you again. does that seem like something you can do. (yells at joey) does it?!!”
no?
look, ross, you have what you want, you are back with rachel. if you bring this up now you are going to wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
(calming down) yeah, i know. i mean, no, you are right. yeah i guess I will let it go. but you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
sure, it is hard to forget! but that does not mean you have to talk about it! a lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to chandler) ever talk about.
what the hell happened on that beach?!
it is between us and the sea, ross!
(to the person that answered the door) hi, ursula.
okay, well umm, i know that we have not talked in a long time, but umm okay, our mom is not our birth mom. this-this other lady is our birth mom.
(shocked) you know her?!
there-there was a suicide note?! (ursula nods ‘yes.’) well, do you still have it?
i can not believe you did not tell me there was a suicide note!
i, umm, shut up!
(reading from the note) “good-bye phoebe and ursula. I will miss you. p.s. your mom lives in montauk.” you just wrote this!
noooo!!
pass the cheese, please.
my god, you can not even look at me! can you?
nope.
(jumping up) hey! phoebe! we can talk to phoebe!!
no. I am-I am to depressed to talk.
I will give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
(coming back in with rachel) hey, you guys! what do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
all right, that is it, you guys! what happened out there?
what? we took a walk, nothing happened. i can back with nothing all over me.
what happened? joey?
all right. (gets up)
(stopping him) no! joey, we swore we would never tell!
(running over and joining monica) they will never understand!
well, we have to say something! we have to get it out! it is eating me alive!! monica got stung by a jellyfish.
(interrupting) all right!! all right. (walks slowly into the living room) i got stung. stung bad. i could not stand. i-i could not walk.
(following monica) we were two miles from the house. scared and alone. we did not think we could make it. (he goes to put his hands on monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)
i was in too much pain.
and i was tired from digging the huge hole!
and then joey remembered something.
I would seen this thing on the discovery channel...
wait a minute! i saw that! on the discovery channel, yeah! about jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at monica) ewwww!! you peed on yourself?!
you can not say that!! you-you do not know!! i mean i thought i was going to pass out from the pain! anyway i-i tried, but i-i could not...bend that way. so... (looks at joey.)
that is right i stepped up! she is my friend and she needed help! and if i had too, I would pee on anyone of you! only, uhh, i could not. i got the stage fright. i wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. so-so i uh, i turned to chandler.
(wails loudly into his hands) joey kept screaming at me, “do it now! do it!! do it! do it now!!” sometimes late at night i can still here the screaming.
(laughs) that is ‘because sometimes i just do it through my wall to freak you out.
(singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) thank you, thank you. ohh, and i invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (sees that phoebe sr. has entered, and to her) except for you. you go away.
okay, bye.
no.
but, it is not like we are losing anything. y'know?
it is not like we-we know each other or anything. or that have anything in common.
i-i like pizza!
oh my god, so do i!
wait-wait-wait, wait! puppies. cute or ugly?
uh-huh, well! but umm, still I am-I am mad at you.
well umm, do you want to get something to eat? I am kind of hungry.
all right, stop it. now you are just doing it to freak me out.
oh-hooo, i missed you.
i missed you too.
ooh, i was soo nervous about that letter. but the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you have grown. y'know?
(getting miffed) i suppose.
you have! ross, you should give yourself credit. i mean my mom never thought this would work out. it was all, “once a cheater, always a cheater.”
(getting angry) umm-hmm.
ooh, i just wish we had not lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
(yelling from the bedroom) we were on a break!!!!!!!
(entering with joey) (to monica) coffee house?
you bet.
and for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!
yeah! you and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
i did not know what i was taking full responsibility for! okay?! i did not finish the whole letter!
what?!!
i fell asleep!
you fell asleep?!
it was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping monica, chandler, and joey in the kitchen) (to rachel) oh-oh-oh, and by the way, y-of-you-apostrophe-r-e means ‘you are,’ y-of-you-r means ‘your!’
y'know i can not believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
(starts to cry) fine by me!! (he opens the door and traps chandler behind it)
oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you are at home on saturday nights playing scrabble with monica!!
hey!!
(to monica) sorry!! (to ross) i just feel bad about all that sleep you are going to miss wishing you were with me!
oh, no-no-no do not you worry about me falling asleep. i still have your letter!!!
and hey! just so you know, it is not that common! it does not happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!
i knew it!!!!
(sets down some cards) gin.
we were playing gin? y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
will you stop!
okay. all right.
okay, all right, i think you are great, i think you are sweet, and you are smart, and i love you. but you will always be the guy who peed on me.
what am i sitting on?
top of the world? dock of the bay? (he tries to think of another but can not) I am out.
(taking something out of the couch) ew-eww!! undies!
all right! who is are they? who is are they?
well, they are not mine!
well, they are joey's! they got to be joey's!
yeah, they are mine.
see? they are joey's! j-j-j-j-j-joey's!
why are they here?
i do not know uhh… (pause as he thinks about it.) well, I am joey. yeah, I am disgusting, i take my underwear off in other people's homes.
well, get  them out of here! what is wrong with you?
yeah!
yeah!
(waving them in his face) take  them! (joey makes a noise and jumps out of the way.) joey, you can touch them! they are your underwear.
(reluctantly taking them) chandler? a word.
that is it! I am tired of covering for you two! this has got to stop! (realizes he still has the underwear in his hand.) ahh! (throws them towards chandler's room.) and tighty-whiteys! what are you, 8?
(entering) thank you joey, thank you so much!
oh hey, no, you are not welcome. okay, look, i hate this! you guys keep embarrassing me! (to monica) yesterday, rachel found your razor in our bathroom and i did not know what to say, so i said it was mine and-and that i was playing a woman in a play. and one thing led to another and (he puts his leg on the chair and pulls up his pants leg to reveal that he now has shaved legs.)
(inspecting his leg) wow! and around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
yeah, it was! all right, listen, i can not…
(interrupting him) all this lying has been hard on us too.
oh-oh, yeah-yeah, i bet all the sex makes it easier!
well, yeah actually.
we will try to be more careful okay? it is just that, we do not want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it is going really well is because it is a secret.
i know it sounds really weird, but we are just so bad at relationships.
we are! help us!
help!
all right! but, (to monica) you do it with me once.
joey!
did not think so.
hey, phoebe!
hi, pheebs!
hey, pheebs!
hey, pheebs!
what are you reading?
umm, wethering heights. I am taking a literature class at the new school and i have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
i did not know you were taking a class. that is so cool.
yeah! well, i really liked that lamaze class i took! y'know and this time i thought I would go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
honey that sounds like fun.
yeah! ooh, you should come with me! oh yeah, then I would have someone to sit with!
okay.
yeah! okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
oh, i read that in high school.
this is going to be so much fun! okay-shhh, i have to finish.
(entering, depressed) hi.
what is wrong buddy?
someone at work ate my sandwich!
well, what did the police say?
my thanksgiving leftover sandwich. i can not believe someone ate it!
ross, it is just a sandwich!
just a sandwich? look, i am 30 years old, I am about to be divorced twice and i just got evicted! that sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
okay, look, i-i have enough stuff for one more sandwich, i mean i was going to eat it myself, but (motions that he can have it.)
(quietly) that-that would be incredible. thank you so much. i-i still can not believe someone ate it!! i mean, look, i left a note and everything.
(reading) knock-knock. who is there? ross geller's lunch. ross geller's lunch, who? ross geller's lunch, please do not take me. okay?
I am surprised you did not go home wearing your lunch.
okay, look you want to hold onto your food? you got to scare people off. i learned that living on the street.
really?! so what would you say pheebs? stuff like uh, "keep your mitts off my grub?"
say ross, when you picture phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie?
okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (writes him a note and the gang reads it.)
phoebe, you are a bad ass!
someday I will, tell you about the time i stabbed the cop.
phoebe?
well, he stabbed me first!!
(to phoebe) sorry I am late, but i left late.
okay.
so pheebs, what is the book about?
i thought you said you read it in high school.
well yeah, but then i remembered i started it and there was this pep rally and i was, i was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?
okay, umm, it is this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england. which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff's character. i totally get symbolism.
umm, well i would have to say that it is a, it is tragic love story.
oh-oh-oh, symbolism! and uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which i think is-is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff's character.
(to rachel) you completely stole my answer!
well, honey that was pretty obvious.
well how would you know?! you did not even read it!
i think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
would you care to venture one?
are you just repeating what I am saying?
okay then.
yeah but why did not you just say that you did not read the book?!
be-because i did not want him to think i was stupid! i mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
(entering) phoebe!
yeah?
phoebe! you are note, amazing! not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. yeah, a guy called me mental! mental geller, yeah, i always wanted a cool nickname like that.
yeah, the best you got in high school was wet pants geller.
that was the water fountain! okay?! anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I am telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want. (joey walks by with a cup of coffee.) hey tribbiani, give me that coffee! now!
so you uh, still wondering?
you are smart. i like that.
oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
hiya.
joey, is what she just said umm—oh my god. (looks around the room.) you were actually going to… (chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (rachel stares in shock.)
what is going on here?
and with chandler in the next room. what are you, what are you sick?
I am joey. i mean, I am disgusting. i make low-budget adult films. (points at chandler, angrily.)
you guys promised you would be more careful! i mean, come on! the good joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
we are so sorry.
yeah.
well, I am telling everyone about you! that is the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that does not make me look like a pig!
no-no, wait! there is got to be a better explanation. you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (thinks) adult film class.
yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place?
oh—i do not know.
well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
okay, just wait, please. i promise we will come up with something. just give us a little more time.
all right. hey, but it better make me look really, really good. (starts for his room.) oh, and another thing, the video camera? nice!!
yeah, of course, donald.
what?!
(proudly) yeah.
oh no, you-you do not understand. ugh, this is so silly. umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
yeah. you see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; i call it the moist maker. anyway, i-i put my sandwich in the fridge over here…
what?
you ate my sandwich?
(getting upset) oh-oh really? did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker?
do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
(getting angry) that said it was my sandwich?!
(jumping to his feet in anger) what?
you-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
(losing control, we hear him shout outside) my sandwich?!!!
my sandwich!!!!!! (ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
hi!
hi!
(sitting down) so umm, what is this book about?
you did not read this one either?!
well, i was going to, but i accidentally read something else.
what?
vogue! hey, so tell me about this jane eyre woman.
no! you should have read it yourself!
come on phoebe! do not be such a goodie-goodie!
fine! okay, all right, so jane eyre, first of all, you would think she is a woman, but she is not. she is a cyborg.
a cyborg?! is not that like a robot?!
yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
umm, rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
uh, thank you phoebe. umm, well, what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.
hey.
hey. okay, so umm, since that video camera thing did not work out uh, i thought that i would give you just a little preview. (hands him a polaroid.)
(gasps) you are naked in this picture!
i know.
ross?
(in a stupor) hey chandler. (sees monica.) monica!
ross, are you okay?
I am fine! i saw a psychiatrist at work today.
why?!
on account of my rage.
which i may say, right now, is out of control.
he gave me a pill for it.
a pill?
uh-huh. well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. and i thought was a good idea so, i took it.
wait a minute, they are making you take time off work?
and you are okay with that?
i do not know. it is going to be weird not having a job for a while, but i, i definitely do not care about my sandwich.
(entering, angrily) ugh, that was so embarrassing! i can not believe you let me go on and on like that!
(smiling) I am sorry. it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop.
that was not funny!
well, i snapped! okay? you were not taking the class seriously.
phoebe, come on! what is the big deal? i thought this was going to be something we could do together! y'know, i thought it would be fun!
well, yeah! fun is good, but y'know i also wanted to learn. y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school.
ohh. oh, so you really wanted to learn. yeah, y'know, pheebs i just wanted to have fun. ohh, you know who you should go with?
(yelling and waving her hand in the air) i know! i know! i know!
(sees the picture) oh my god! that is monica!!
oh no-no-no! no-no-no-no-no-no-no!
you get away from me!! you sick, sick, sick, sick-of!!
(entering, with the rest of the gang) what is going on?
joey has got a secret peephole!
(sees the picture) oh no! no! no! no! (monica gasps as well.)
yes! he has a naked picture of monica! he takes naked pictures of us! and then he eats chicken and looks at them!
look! (shows ross the picture.)
(covering his eyes) dude! that is my sister! (she shows the rest of the gang.)
(grabbing the picture) give me that!
all right, wait! just wait. everybody just calm down. okay? let us give our friend joey a chance to explain why he is such a big pervert!
no! i am not a pervert! okay? it is just… i just… kind of…
all right, look! look. i think i can explain this.
thank you!
joey's a sex addict.
what?!! (he turns around and stares at chandler who is silently pleading with joey to go along with it.) no I am not!!
it is okay! it is good! it is good. it is a disease!
no! no! i am not a sex addict!
yes you are! that is the only way to explain all this stuff!
no it is not! no, it is not. because you can also explain it with the truth!
well, what is the truth?
yeah, what is going on?
what is going on?
(thinking) i slept with monica.
well let us….let us see what everybody thinks of that?
oh no!
you slept with my sister?
uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in london.
this is not good for my rage. (takes another pill.)
monica, is this true?
of course it is true! how else would you explain all the weird stuff that is been going on?
yes it is true.
okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
ahh—oy! that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london. right monica?
i guess i wanted to keep it (pause) as a souvenir.
my god monica!!
are you sure joe? are you sure you are not just a sex addict?
no! if anyone's a sex addict here, it is monica! yeah. yeah. she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!
so that is why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
that makes sense!
and the video camera?
uhh, monica?
i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey.
but sadly i could not be enticed.
unbelievable! i mean you really kept joey's underwear?! why? why would you do that?!
I am monica. I am disgusting. i stalk guys and keep their underpants.
well, i think we have all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not. eh? all right, now, I am going to get back to my bucket. I am only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. (offers it to everyone.)
i really thought you making a good point. i mean y'know, until you got cut off.
i do not know! i did not come with her!
(entering, happily) all right everybody! everybody guess what? i just convinced paul to give us a test next week!
come on! tests make us all better learners! oh yeah! (running out) we should have essay questions!!
well that thing is clearing in the way! all right. ah-ha! (he grabs a screwdriver and starts to attack the compressor, only he causes a small short circuit and shocks himself.) ah-ah!! damn fridge!
hi joey, how ya doing?
great! roomie!
huh, yeah i guess we are roommates now.
yeah! well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. we have to get a new one. now, i checked around and your half is $400. thanks a lot.
I am not paying for half of that! I am only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
look rach, my parents bought this fridge just after i was born, okay? now, i have never had a problem with it. then you show up and it breaks! what does that tell ya’?
that refrigerators do not live as long as people.
all right, now you know that the atm will only let us you take out 300 at a time, I will take a check for the other hundred.
you are jokin’ right?
of course I am jokin’! i do not take checks.
thank god you are pretty. (exits.)
hey!
do you guys know any cute guys?
well, of course i do! my good friend joey over here. (pats joey’s arm, joey pats chandler’s shoulder, and chandler motions for joey to say the same about him.)
oh, I am sorry. thank you chandler.
anyway, there is this big charity ball this weekend and ralph lauren bought a table, so i kind of have to go…
what is the charity?
i do not know, something either trees or disease—ralph mumbles a lot.
does ralph mumble when you are not paying attention?
yeah! it is weird. but the thing is need to find a date.
well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.
so he has to be a male who has at least $50.
ooh! so close.
hey everybody!
hey uh, this is elizabeth.
(laughs) is not she cute? (on monica’s death stare) no!
y’know, this is probably none of my business, but were not you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
oh no-no-no, we are just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (he winks at her.)
oh, sly.
bye.
oh that is quite all right madam. (elizabeth exits.)
so, why is she leaving? is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
oh, tell her good luck with that.
anyone else? huh? bring ‘them on!
oo! when is her birthday?!
i do not know rachel, why?
well, y’know it is just been so long since I have been to chuckie cheese.
oh, i like elizabeth.
well thanks!
yeah. in fact, i like her so much you tell her i want my cookies early this year! y’know, a box of thin mints and some tag-a-longs.
hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. ross, seriously, how is it going with her?
well, actually it is been great. she is 20 so she is not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
well that is great. and seriously, she seems very nice.
thanks. i know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. just knowing that you guys are…
(interrupting) okay, i got a good one. okay, umm, what is she? like 12?
chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
yeah. do we have any fruit roll-ups?
(entering) hey!
hey!
okay, i just thought of the perfect guy for rachel to take to her thing.
oh that is so funny because we found someone too.
oh that is good, i guess she will have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
why would our guy be a weirdo?
‘because that is just your taste.
(laughs sarcastically) rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
oh yeah?
yeah!
my guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. and, he has one of these (she squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)
a face ass?
a chin dimple!
well, uh y’know, our guy works with chandler and he is really nice and smart and he is a great dresser!
have you seen your guy’s body?
no, our guy is just a floating head.
well my guy is spectacular. okay? he is a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, i looked at it. and i mean all of it.
you are not supposed to look!
oh yeah, like there are police for that!
(horrified) wait! you look? you-you massaged me.
i know. (laughs.)
all right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.
oh, chandler funny?
our guy’s a great dancer!
my guy is well read.
our guy has great hair.
my guy has great teeth!
our guy smells incredible.
(to chandler) do you want our guy to be your guy?
hey.
huh.
well, you…do not look good joe.
the fridge broke. i have to eat everything. cold cuts, ice cream, limes—hey, what was in that brown jar?
that is still in there?!
not anymore. so anyway, how do you want to pay me?
is this a service you are providing me?
no! no! no! for my new fridge—our new fridge!
our new fridge? i do not live here anymore.
so what? look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
uh-huh.
and i got custody of the kid, right? now suppose the kid dies and-and i got to buy a new kid.
(not quite sure where joey’s going and is a little worried) okay…
(pause) give me $400!
hmm? (turns around and sees that its elizabeth) oh, a student i do not know.
yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
shh! (laughs then composes himself) of course, why do not we go inside?
oh-ooh!
doorknob! doorknob!
oh, okay. what-what about?
spring vacation.
(quickly jumping away from elizabeth) yes, professor feesen-sen-stenlger… I will be with you in one moment. (to elizabeth) so, i will take one box of the thin mints. (and he ushers elizabeth out of the office.)
you do not understand! elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! is that taking it slow?! no, I am not ready for this! okay? what-what do i tell her?
just tell her the truth! tell her you are not ready.
i can do that. oh-oh, what if she gets upset?
then you distract her with a barbie doll.
or! you can just, y’know… (he walks up close to whisper in ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes ross into the fridge.)
what the hell are you doing?
what? what the hell am i doing? you just broke my fridge!
what?! what? how do you, how do you even know its broken?!
oh-ho-ho, you think i do not know what breaks my fridge? excuse me! (he opens the door and feels inside.) well what do you know! broken! that will be $400!
joey, i saw you push him!
(pause) you pushed him!
joey, i did not break this! okay? (he opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) that has been broken for a while.
all right. chandler, do you remember how i told you about our fridge?
uh-huh.
i still have not gotten a check for your half yet.
do not give him any money!
I am not talking to you! you broke my fridge!
yes. yes! please, come in.
oo-oo!
yeah, it kind of grows on you. (they both laugh.) actually, i wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
look, i… (he has trouble sitting in his chair.) look, I am having a great time with you and i just do not want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. so, I am sorry i just do not think we should go away together yet. it is-it is too soon.
no. i think you misunderstood what i was saying. what i meant was…
that! let us talk about that.
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey! how did it go with elizabeth?
huh? oh-oh, it was fine. uh, it was just a misunderstanding. she did not want me to go with her. she just wanted to let me know that she is going to florida for spring vacation.
wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (does a little whooping/party noise.)
what is-what is the difference?
well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. spring break you are doing frat guys.
hey, y’know what? not all spring breaks are like that.
what did you do on yours?
i went to egypt with my dad.
i can see it now, "look dad, it is the sphinx!" (does that party noise again.)
hey, i think elizabeth is a little more serious than, "spring break!" (imitates the party noise.) all right? i mean she is taken my class!
and slept with the professor.
I am going to call her.
yeah.
hey! you guys umm, i want you to meet sebastian.
we just uh, we just met at the newsstand. we both grabbed for the last field & stream. (chandler’s shocked.) what? i read that.
oh yes! thank you! (he does so and rachel sits down on the couch.)
rachel, what the hell is this?!
(shocked) what?
you ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
you found me a guy?
yes! we found you a really cute and funny guy from chandler’s work!
yeah and i-i found you one too who is not a weirdo.
well, y’know what though you guys? i really appreciate that but i think I am just going to take sebastian to the charity.
are you sure?! because our guy smells incredible!
uh, would you stop it with that already?!
oh, thank you.
so, sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
no reason, it is just i know a single guy that cares about other people.
are you funny?
what are you guys doing?
are you funny? tell us a joke!
well, so do a lot of people.
oh, but y’know, no, you did not give me your phone number.
(to monica) turns out he is kind of funny.
i cannot believe you guys! he was really nice and he left because of you!
yeah, but sebastian? what is that? a cat’s name?
yeah, y’know what i noticed rachel? he scares easy. is that the kind of guy you would like to take to a ball? "hey sebastian, would you like to dance?" (imitates him.) "uhh, okay—i got to go!"
all right guys stop it. rachel, we are very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. and y’know what? let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
yeah! what have you got to lose? y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.
all right.
okay, so you will meet our guys?
yes, I will meet ‘them.
okay now it does not matter which one you choose, y’know? it is completely up to you. our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
(entering) pheebs! there you are! okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
okay sure!
really?!
ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
call it even?
okay.
(to ross) well, there you are! so what did elizabeth say?
well, it turns out that she is going to daytona for spring break woo-hoo. that means, that means wet t-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you do not even know…
man, she is going to have a great time! is she staying at the hotel corona?
you know the hotels?
sure! i was there! spring break ’81! woo-hoo!
in 1981 you were 13!
so what? i drove down, sold t-shirts, had a blast. and y’know who knows how to party? drunk college chicks.
okay, she can not go.
ross, you can not tell her not to go. you just started dating.
then what am i supposed to do?
nothing, you just have to be cool with it.
well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
well, maybe you do not marry this one.
I am so glad you are going on this trip!
sure. sure. look i do not, i do not know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey i-i know another great way to blow off steam.
are you into crafts at all?
well, yeah, of-of course I am okay! what? I am just being supportive. supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, what is this? (he holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)
to wear in front of people?
is this?!
hey!
good-good-good-good.
hey!
hey!
hi!
we are really glad you decided to meet our guy.
oh…
you are going to like him so much. so umm, when do you want to meet him?
i do not know. i know i do not work late tomorrow night.
tomorrow night is good. tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (laughs) eldad come here! (he stands up from the next table.)
what?
eldad, this is rachel.
well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.
eldad, sit down. (to rachel) move over! move over now!
i—ohh! (moves over and let us eldad sit on the couch.)
there you go! there you are! (rachel stares at monica and chandler)
okay! okay! we can take a hint! (they start to leave but run into phoebe with her guy in tow.) (to phoebe) what are you doing here?!
this is patrick. (points to him.)
hi. (to phoebe) okay, you are too late okay? because she is already with our guy.
(looks) oh my god, you are right! i am too late; they are sitting on the couch and talking! (to patrick) come on! (they go over to the couch.) rachel?
yeah?
this is patrick.
oh, hi.
yeah, this is the guy i was telling you about.
yeah?
yeah. and believe me, this suit does not do justice to what is underneath it.
oh-okay, but pheebs?
yeah?
I am just sort of in the middle of something.
oh! okay! yeah, that is okay. (to patrick) have a seat. (sits patrick down next to rachel.)
no! you can not do that!
(stopping him) sit down! we are winning!
okay, y’know what? maybe i should go!
rachel! rachel! you have not touched eldad’s hair!
it is the softest hair! touch it! (both he and monica do so.)
yeah, I am good.
rachel? patrick is really rich. (to patrick) give her some money.
that is right patrick, bye-bye!
(to rachel) eldad is much more cooperative! and he can dance! (to eldad) you dance for rachel!
no-no! do not dance for me! please? do not! (she gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) what is the matter with you guys?
yeah, okay, let us talk it out.
i… am i the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I will tell ya who should be embarrassed! it is you guys! come on! this is ridiculous! thank you very much, but i do not need you to get me a date!
then why did she ask us to…
i am still talking!! and then you chase away the one guy that i actually liked! i mean, no offense to you guys. really! i mean (to patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (he nods) and-and y’know—(feels eldad’s hair)—wow! you do have very soft hair! but i would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! good-bye! (grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to eldad) now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
thank you! (storms out.)
so uh, have a great time down there.
yeah. and did you, did you pack that bathing suit?
it was pretty funny when i, when i hid it for a while, huh? anyway, umm, i-i am worried about that bathing suit, not because it is revealing which I am fine with, no I am concerned about your health, sun exposure.
well, if what is in the bottle is actually 30. i mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it is-it is get 4, and i swear to god more often than not it is just milk.
really?
okay. cool.
call me!
rachel, we are sorry for pushing those guys on you.
oh that is all right! y’know, i ended up having a really good time. y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
so what was it for anyway?
i want to say a disease.
(entering) hey!
i just got this really weird message from ross. he said turn on mtv.
huh. all right.
oh my god, look! that is elizabeth!
oh-oh professor geller.
ahh, to be 13 again.
yeah.
she is not here yet. she is not here. she is having my baby and she is not here.
I am sure everything's fine. has her water broke yet?
i do not know, but when i spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
do we have to know about that?
joey, what are you going to do when you have a baby?
I am going to be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
yes, joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
god, i do not believe this. she could be giving birth in the cab.
oh, ross, relax. it is probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
what, it is ok when chandler does it?
you have to pick your moments.
did i miss it, did i miss it?

(to carol) where the hell have you been?
susan wanted a chunky. we are having a baby, ok, a baby, you do not stop for chunkys.
i used to have that bumper sticker.

(weakly) no.
dr. franzblau, hi.
59 seconds. (holds up his watch) quartz, ha.

and if you need anything else, i—(notices the handsome dr. franzblau)—do not believe we have met. hi. I am, uh, rachel green. I am carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate.
oh, that is funny!
i want a baby.

(singing)

ok.
oh, look, twins. hi, guys. oh, cute, cute.
no fair. i do not even have one. how come they get two?
you will get one.
oh yeah? when?
all right. I will tell you what. when we are 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?
why will not i be married when I am 40?
oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
ok, hypothetically, why will not i be married when I am 40?
no, no, no.
what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
(trapped) uh, uh.
well?
dear god! this parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
hey.
hey. ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
did you go home and change?
yeah, well, it is an important day. i want to look nice. um, has uh dr. franzblau been by?
no, i have not seen him.
well, where is he? he is supposed to be here. (pause) what if the baby needs him?
rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? was, like, your father a doctor?
yeah, why?
no reason. (turns around, makes an 'oh my god' gesture with his eyes)
tribbiani.
(takes phone) hi, yeah, it is me. (listens) oh, no no no, we are just friends. (listens) yeah, I am single. (listens) 25. (listens) an actor. (listens) hello?
yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what is the deal with this father guy, i mean, if someone was having my baby somewhere, I would want to know about it, you know?
ok, look, maybe i should just go.
good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
you know what the celtics problem is? they let the players run the team.
oh, it is.
it is.
breathe.
breathe.
breathe.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
who the hell is jordie?
no-no-no. i do not have a son named jordie. we all agreed, my son's name is jamie.
what? whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to jordie? we never landed on jordie. we just passed by it during the whole jessy, cody, dylan fiasco.
i got it.
i got it! hey, you get to sleep with her, i get the cramps.
why?
no, you started it.
but...
(to susan) thanks a lot.
(to carol) yeah, listen...
ew! what is that? something exploded!
(panicked) water breaking, what do you mean? what is that, water breaking?
please. this is so your fault.
look, carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
you tryin' to be clever? a funny lady?
oh, I am threatened by you?
hey, hey, ok, all right, that is it! get in here. come on. my god, you guys, i do not believe you. there are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. so just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
yeah, susan.
do not make me do this again, i do not like my voice like this.
ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
I am having a baby in here! ok, everyone stand back. (walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls) ow.
no, honey, they are not, but do not worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
ok?
(to dr. franzblau) ok, so anyway, you were telling me about paris, it sounds fascinating.
come on, lydia, you can do it. push! push  them out, push  them out, harder, harder. push  them out, push  them out, way out! let us get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. let us— (notices the nurse looking at him strangely) i was just—yeah, right. push! push!
help! help!
(singing) they found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...(sees ross and susan staring at her) la la la la la la.
now, mom, everything's going fine, really. (listens) yeah, ross is great. he is uh, he is in a whole other place. (listens) no, he is gone. (listens) no no, you do not have to fly back, really. (listens) what do you mean this might be your only chance? (listens) would you stop? I am only 26, I am not even thinking about babies yet.
where have you been?
oh, just had a baby.
mazel tov!
(anxiously) no, no, not at the moment, no, I am not. are you?
right, yeah, I have heard that about cute doctors.
oh.
I am a waitress.
(getting the point) yeah. gotcha.
ok. that is fine. (takes her earrings out)
come on, come on. damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. (to susan) this is all your fault. this is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? my son is being born, and i should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
no no no, believe me. no one has been waiting for this as much as i have, ok? and you know what the funny thing is? when this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? where does that leave me?
every day is lesbian lover day.
this is so great.
you want to explain that?
i mean, well, because when i was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. and here is this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they are fighting over who gets to love it the most. and it is not even born yet. it is just, it is just the luckiest baby in the whole world. (pause) I am sorry, you were fighting.
I am sure they will be here soon.
yeah, honey, they would not miss this.
relax. you are only at nine centimeters. and the baby's at zero station.
(to joey) you are really frightening me.
somebody want to help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) uh, that is great. (looking around) anybody seen a nipple?
ok, got the vent open.
(reading the nametag on the uniform) hi, I am ben. I am hospital worker ben. it is ben... to the rescue!
ben, you ready? all right, give me your foot. ok, on three, ben. one, two, three. ok, that is it, ben.
well, susan, i see what appears to be a dark vent. wait. yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
phoebs, it is open! it is open!
we are here!
long story, honey.
(to nurse) let me ask you, do you have to be carol's lesbian life partner?
let me see, i got to see, i got to see. oh, a head. oh, it is, it is huge. carol, how are you doing this?
(puts his head near the baby) hello! (to dr. franzblau) oh, sorry.
we got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. it is a boy, definitely a boy! all right! ok, legs, knees, and feet. oh, oh. he is here. he is a person.
kind of like my uncle ed, covered in jell-of.
(from the air vent overhead) you guys, he is beautiful!
oh, thanks, pheebs!
(thinking) how 'bout ben?
we uh, we just cooked it up.
hi.
hey.
can we come in?
(to ben) i know, i know. everybody, there is someone I would like you to meet. yeah. this is ben. ben, this is everybody.
susan, he looks just like you.
oh, god, i can not believe one of us actually has one of these.
i know, i still am one of these.
ross, can i?
the head, the head. you got to...
(getting choked up) hi, ben. hi. I am your aunt monica. yes i am. I am your aunt monica. i...i will always have gum.
ben, i want you to know that there may be some times when i may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) but I will still always come back, like this. (returns) and sometimes i may be away longer, like this. (walks away) but I will still always come back, like this. (returns)
and sometimes, I will want you to steal third, and I will go like this. (does a baseball sign.)
he is so amazing.
oh, i know. look at him.
ben, ben, hey ben. nothing. i do not think that is his name.
oh, look, look, he is closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) look, he is opening his eyes. (picture comes back)
he does not do much, does he?
no, this is pretty much it.
you guys want to get some coffee?
all right, I will see you guys later.
oh, look, he is closing his eyes again.
hi.
hi! hi ben!
hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.
oh, yeah go ahead.
uh, before we do uh, are any of joey’s special romance magazines in there?
no. no.
(to ben) okay! all clear!
ben, its rachel! (he closes the door.) but whatever.
(to ben) everything okay in there?
awww, just like his daddy.
hey listen can you do me a big favor? the dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. can you watch ben for like an hour?
what-what about monica?
oh, she is not home.
(nervous) so it would just be, me alone?
well, ben would be there.
huh umm…
what is the matter?
well that—y’know it is just uh, I have never done that before. me and him alone.
rach, he is not an ex-con.
okay. okay. okay. uh, what do i, what do i do with him?
i do not know! just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
okay.
okay. (ben enters) ben? come here. all right, I am going to leave you here with aunt rachel for about an hour. okay? are you going to be okay?
yeah i think so.
(to rachel) i was not talking to you.
okay, I will see you soon buddy. (he hugs and kisses him.) be back in an hour.
bye. (ross exits.) ahhh… (silence) so this is fun, huh?
okay. uh, want something-want something to drink?
uh great! how do you feel about diet coke?
okay. well that is pretty much all that we have—oh! oh! have you ever had a virgin margarita? (holds up a bottle of margarita mix.)
water it is.
what about the second minister we meet with? i kind of liked him.
you mean the spitter?
come on! it was not that bad!
easy for you to say; you will be wearing a veil.
all right, what about the third guy?
you mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
can you blame him?
sorry, i just do not like the idea of when i say, "i do," he is thinking, "yeah, I would do her too!"
well then we still have a problem.
yeah!
(returning with joey) with what?
well, we are trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they are all either boring or annoying or y’know, can not stop staring at the ladies. (points to her chest.)
oo! you should have one of us do it!
phoebe, we are getting married, married; not sixth grade married.
no! no! it is-it is uh a real thing! anyone can get ordained on the internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
are you serious?
yes! a friend of mine did it and it is totally legal!
i call it!!
what?! no! it was my idea!
guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
we are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! and when i say legitimate i mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and i used to hang out all the time. ‘because i was, i was your daddy’s girlfriend.
no, I am not.
hey! we were not on a—okay. that is fine! fine. y’know what ben? one day when you are a lot older i am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?
(checks her watch) fifty-two minutes. (pause) so no-no brothers and sisters, huh? that must be nice. you do not have to share stuff.
oh, you are one of those. but y’know what? i have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we would jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they would put salt on their cereal.
yeah? you like that one?
I am funny? oh thank god! well hey, I have got a ton of these! umm, oh hear—do you want a good one? here is a good one. umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. right? (does so.) and then you say to person, i bet you can not roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. and then when they do it, they are left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
yeah, i-i-i-I am funny ben, but I am not stupid. okay?
so, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
no, but horny for monica minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
we are never going to find anybody.
well then let me do it!
joe…
no-no-no! look, I have been thinking about it. I am an actor right? so i will not get nervous talking in front of people.
joey look it is really sweet…
no-no-no-no look no! i will not spit, and i will not stare at monica’s breasts! y’know? everyone knows I am an ass man!
that is true.
yeah and the most important thing is that it will not be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. it will be me! and i swear I will do a really good job. plus, y’know i love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
(to monica) y’know, we have not found anybody else.
it might be kind of cool.
so i can do it?
yeah you can do it.
all right!!! okay!! all right! okay-okay, i got to get started on my speech! oh, wait a minute, internet ministers can still have sex right?
yeah.
okay.
hey pheebs, how is it going?
oh, i have a headache. a horrible headache!
oh, I am sorry. can i get you something?
oh my god, you have got to stop chattering!
here, take a couple of these. (she gets up to grab a couple of pills.)
what is it?
it is hexadrin.
oh no, i do not believe in western medicine. no, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (she is pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (takes the pills.)
okay, while we are waiting for these pills to kick in, I am going to sit you down on the couch. come on. (phoebe gets up and goes with her.) get some nice soft pillows under your head, I am going to turn the tv on and you can watch whatever you want. and I am—sit down—(she sits down on the couch)—going to make you some tea. and then, I am going to rub your feet.
oh.
oh! my head! oh! (he is sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for monica to rub.) oh!
coming.
i have a bone to pick with you.
uh-oh.
yes! ben learned a little trick.
oh yeah? did he pull the old… (she is waving her hand up and down her face. she is thinking about the pencil mark.)
that is right! that is right! saran wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
oh that.
yeah that! you know i hate practical jokes! they are mean and they are stupid and-and i do not want my son learning them!
oh, come on! saran wrap on the toilet seat, you do not think that is just a little funny?!
i was barefoot. now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
(looking at his mark) yes.
it is amazing! my headache is completely gone! what are those pills called?
hexadrin. (she gets the box out of her purse.)
oh, i love you hexadrin! (she kisses the box.) oh look! it comes with a story! (she pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)
no phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
say what?
y’know, the possible side affects.
oh my god! (starts reading them.) dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—headache. vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! now okay, i do not recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! oh I am sorry, extra strength death capsules!
phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! they just put it on there for legal reasons!
why?
in case it happens.
(entering) hey!
hey!
say hello to reverend joey tribbiani! (holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)
hey!
you did it! you got ordained?!
yeah, i just got off the internet! man, there is a lot of porn out there!
our minister…
i have liver damage. ow! oh! (she grabs the left side of her torso.)
phoebe, your liver is right here. (she points to the right side of her torso.)
okay, then i must be disoriented.
anyway, i started working on what I am going to say for the ceremony, do you want to hear it?
okay.
yeah!
now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) "we are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that monica and chandler share." (monica and chandler like it so far.) eh? (he continues reading.) "it is a love based on giving and receiving. as well as having and sharing. and the love that they give and have is shared and received. and through this having and giving and sharing and receiving." (phoebe nods her approval.) "we too can share and love and have and receive."
(to monica) should we call the spitter?
hi!
well y’know i was just in the neighborhood and i passed by your building and i thought to myself, "what is up with carol and sweet, little ben?"
okay.
I would love that. i would loooove… (carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) so uh, so where is sweet little ben? i would love to have a little...
i found him! (to ben) very funny, come here! (she sits down on the coffee table and ben walks up.) that is exactly why I have come here to talk to you okay?
yes oh—(to ben)—do i want sugar in my coffee? (ben nods no.) no, just some milk would be good carol. thanks. (to ben) okay, do you remember all that stuff i taught you yesterday?
do not do that.
seriously, your dad does not like pranks.
oh damnit!
no! do not say that! do not say that!
no do not! go back to repeating!
oh crap!
i feel like my face is swelling. (to monica) is my face swelling?
phoebe, your face is fine! come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! stop being such a baby!
oh, interesting you should call me that! now that i may never have one! (holds up the warning label.)
okay you guys, i got a little more written. are you ready?
yeah. of-okay.
(reading) "when i think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, i can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…" and then i can not think of a good word for right here. (he points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)
how about receiving?
yes!
see joe, not that that is not grrreat! but, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! y’know, it can be more personal. you can tell stories about us!
ooh, like the time you and i went to atlantic city and i made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! remember?
no, not us… (motions joey and him.) us! (motions monica and him.)
i gotcha. sorry. (to monica) so, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
it does not say that!
oh! suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
see joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. nice stories.
oh. okay. ooh! ooh! okay, maybe I will talk about london! y’know when you two hooked up! only, only i will not say hooked up. I will say, "began their beautiful journey…"
there you go!
"…by doing it."
joe?
okay. all right. umm, so uh, so how did it happen? did your eyes meet across the room? and then the next thing y’know you are in the bathtub together and she is feeding you strawberries?
is not that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
yeah!! i call that london style.
no that is not what happened with us. well, i was umm, i was really sad that night because this guy that i was ross’s mom.
oh.
and then chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. and well we drank too much…
yeah baby!
and i was a perfect gentleman and i walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
oh.
but then later that night…
yeah baby!
(answering the door) hey!
(standing outside) cute pj’s! you are really livin’ it up here in london huh?
well i was… i was exactly expecting company after…(he looks at his watch.) 9:15.
(entering) is joey here?
well, last time i saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. so uh, you are not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
would not you be?
well, look it is been a really emotional time y’know, and you have had a lot to drink. and you have just got to let that go okay? i mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
really?
you kidding? you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what is going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?
well, not anymore.
but we do not do that.
i know, i just thought it would be fun.
how drunk are you?
drunk enough to know that i want to do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
(thinks) that is the perfect amount!
okay!
(breaking the kiss) y’know what is weird?
what?
this does not feel weird!
i know.
you are a really good kisser.
well, i have kissed over four women. (they kiss again.) do you want to get under the covers?
hm-hmm!
okay!
wow! you are really fast!
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
we are going to see each other naked.
yep!
do you want to do it at the same time?
count of three?
one!
two!
two!
well i think it is safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
eh, we were not that close anyway!
eh!
joey! joey! joey! j-j-joey-joey-j-joey! (monica hides under the covers as joey enters. remember?)
hey!
hey joe! i was just watching a movie-e-e… (notices that the tv is turned off.)
oh, dude I am so sorry!
no! no! no!
hey no-no-no-no! it is cool! it is cool! i-I will only be a second, I am still with my bride’s maid, i just—where are those condoms you brought?
they are in my bag over there. (points.)
ah. (joey walks to chandler’s bag by getting as far away from chandler’s bed as possible.)
uh, could you leave me one?
(pause) for just you?
yeah.
hey listen, why do not you come downstairs with me? there is some really nice girls down there.
no i-i-I am fine.
all right, here you go buddy. (he tosses him one.) go nuts. (exits.)
that is what that was?! ‘because that other thing? i thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.
okay, can we change the topic? because it is really doing nothing for me.
oh… (to chandler) can you imagine if i had not left you that last one? you two might have never gotten together. ooh-ooh! could you imagine if i sent that hooker up to the room like i was going to?! it is like it was in the stars!
yeah, it is totally meant to be. (to monica) tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
what?!
what?
(to joey) what?!
who did you originally want to hook up with?
okay, fine but please do not be upset! okay? i was really depressed okay? and really drunk! i just wanted something stupid and meaningless. i just wanted…just sex. so, when i…went to your room that night…i was actually looking…for joey. (joey smiles.)
yeah baby! (chandler glares at him.) no baby!
(to monica) so you came to the room looking for joey? did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
no because it-it did not seem important.
oh, it is not important? it is not important?! if it was not for a bride’s maid you would be marrying him (points to joey) not me!
noo!! the point is that is was you that was there that night! it is you that i am marrying! it is you that i feel in love with!
and it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—(shuts up on monica’s glare.)
i do not believe it. the most romantic night of my life and I am runner up.
chandler, please! do you know how unbelievably glad i am that joey was not there that night?!
hey! (monica turns and looks at him) now I am a man of the cloth, but i still have feelings!
(to joey) look there is no way you are doing this wedding now. okay?
what?! that is not fair! it is not my fault! i was off with my bride’s maid! and who is to say i would have even said yes?! (to monica) i mean i would have said yes. chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? look, everything worked out okay!
okay, it is just weird! okay? i do not want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and monica! i-i-i need…i do not know what i need. i need a walk.
wait chandler come on, let us—it is not a big deal!
it is to me. you wanted to sleep with batman, and instead you had to settle for robin. (walks out and slams the door.)
this is crazy.
i know! robin is so gay!
so now what have we agreed?
and-and what else?
very good.
rachel! what are you doing here?
I am just visiting my good friend carol.
your good friend?
yeah!
what is her last name?
carol…lesbian?
nice. and by the way that uh, that line down my face?
what line?
wh-wh-what line? the line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh, (in a college frat boy voice) "dude, do not you ever was your face?"
all right, I am sorry. I am sorry i did not tell you but you were so mad already!
of course i was mad! i told you i-i hate this stuff! okay? it-it is not funny!
hi.
practical jokes.
you have a line down your face.
okay, maybe they are not funny to you…
or carol! but they are funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
uh, y’know what? I will tell you who it hurts! it hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
that was you?! we heard about you in junior high! did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "i will be revenged?!"
i will be! listen, i do not want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. okay?
fine. fine, but I will have you know that once i taught him that stuff he called me fun aunt rachel. and i loved being fun aunt rachel but I will go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel if that is what you want!
no that is not what i want. uh, I am glad you guys were bonding but i…
look he does not have any brothers or sisters, somebody is going to have to teach him this stuff! and i have not taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old does not know anyway!
i got to go! (runs out.)
hey.
hey. do you want this scone? (holds up his plate) it came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
chandler, come on nothing even happened!
look joe, i know you wanted to do the wedding…
no-hey-no! if you do not want me to do it, i except that. i do not care about that. i just…i do not want you to be upset.
how can i not be upset? okay? i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
yeah for like a half an hour one night! chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! you are so lucky! look what i missed out on by not being there! although you know what? it could never have worked like you guys did, ‘because you guys are perfect for each other. y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. y’know? and you just know it is going to last forever.
that is what you should say.
what?
when you are marrying us; that is what you should say.
really? i can do it?
I would love it if you would do it.
hey! (they hug.)
but those are the words! those exact words!
well i do not know remember exactly but, it is-it is pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
hey!
hey!
hey I am sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after ben for a little bit? i-I have got this meeting at school. and-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘fun aunt’ rachel, so…
ohhh! well of course i will watch him! we have fun, do not we ben? (he nods yes.)
okay, I will see you later pal.
ohh, okay. (ross has a sign on his back that reads ‘poop.’) wh—ah-ha! (ross stops and turns.) wait a minute. uh ben, i can not do it.
what?
i can not let him go out that way, he is got a meeting. (to ross) you have got something here on your back.
what? (she takes the sign off and hands it to him.) that is great. that is great. (crumples up the paper and throws it down in anger.) what did we just finish talking about ben?!
oh i…
all right, that is it! (he runs over to ben, but he runs past him and out the door.) come—you—no! you are in big trouble young man!
no! wait! come on!
wait! no! ben, come here! i am not kidding!
no you guys… (she walks out into the hallway.)
i-i-am—(suddenly ross starts screaming and comes falling down the stairs landing just in front of rachel.)
ehhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! my god!!!!!!!!!!! oh my god!!!!!!! (she runs over to him and finds that it was a dummy and that she had been had.)
hey!
hey-hey.
so are guys doing okay?
yeah, we talked and monica made me see that i over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
yeah baby! (phoebe and joey nod.)
I am really glad you guys are okay but, i just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two (points to monica and joey) actually had hooked up.
honey! dinner’s ready!
your favorite!
ho-ho-ho, (pausing for a rest next to the fridge) fried stuff with cheese!
yep! and lot’s of it!
okay, in we go.
here you go.
(still reading the label) oh my god! this is a six-hour pill! (checks her watch) that is it! I am out of the woods! ohh! what a relief!
good for you!
oh, it is like huge weight has been lifted! ‘because look, (reads the side affects) no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I am just so happy! because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—oh.
oh! hey, rach!
hi! hey, happy valentine’s day!
oh, you, too.
hey, so, uh, how is it going living over at ross’?
it is good. except he makes us watch the discovery channel all day long. did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the middle ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) oh, thank you. I will see you guys later.
okay.
bye.
there is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
(sighs) honey, i wish you would get over her. i hate seeing you like this. is there anything i can do for you? do you want to look down my top?
thanks. but maybe later.
oh, gunther, can i get a scone?
you know what i want? i want a lot of things! i want to be with the woman i love on valentine’s day! and i want her to love me back! and i want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that is never going to happen!
oh, okay.
so, how does mona feel about you and rachel living together?
oh, I am actually on my way to tell her right now. yeah, she is been away all week visiting her parents, but she will be cool. i mean, she is been so supportive. she-she even got the baby a tiny t-shirt that says, ‘fossils are my friends.’
ugh. come on, mona, do not kiss ass.
uh, I am going to take off.
all right. oh! shoot! oh shoot! uh, rachel wanted to see this tape!
what is it?
it is a video of my friend giving birth. could you just bring it back to your apartment?
all right. (reading the label) ‘candy and cookie?’
yeah. candy’s the mother, cookie’s the daughter. the father’s also cookie. why am i friends with these people?
(entering with something behind her back) phoebe, c’mere. i want to show you something in the bathroom.
oh, monica, grow up!
hey, what is behind your back?
nothing. just something i want to get phoebe’s opinion on for valentine’s day.
you do not want my opinion?
not really.
come on, I am your older brother, ask me!
all right, big brother. (holds up two erm…revealing articles of clothing) which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
(quietly) the red one.
(knocking and entering) hey. look, i know you have been really depressed lately, so i brought someone over to cheer you up. right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
no, I am not sleeping with your friend jane again.
he-hee!
hey! a dog! hi! who, you got to admit, looks a lot like jane.
this is the happiest dog in the world. i borrowed him from my friend wendy. now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. and he will cheer you up!
thanks so much, pheebs! (to the dog) we are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between joey’s legs) oh! not that kind of fun.
happy valentine’s!
(from her bedroom) okay! I will be right out. I am slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
(picking up a video from the table) ‘candy and cookie’. ‘candy and cookie?’ monica got me porn?! girl-on-girl porn?! she really must love me!! (chandler runs over to the tv, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some "porn")
i love you, st. valentine.
woah, woah, that is not pretty!
worst porn ever! worst porn ever! (chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)
i am trying!
get the ball, ready? get the ball, get the ball! (joey pretends to throw it, but really does not, and the dog goes running off.) well, you are cute, but you are not too smart!
(looking at the ball the dog brought back) did i just throw this?
(entering) hi.
hi.
i accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) who is this?
oh, that is, uh, that is phoebe’s friend’s dog. i do not know what his real name is, but i call him mozzarella.
(talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it is hard to explain. just use your imagination!) oh, well, you are so cute! i wish i could play with you more, but I have got to go to work! i hope i stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes i do. yes i do. (still talking like that) bye-bye, joey. oh, i seriously can not stop it. (exits)
(to the dog) c’mere. hey. c’mere. that is rachel. she is the one who used to live here. might as well be honest with you—we love her. but we can not have her. i really miss her. well, hey, you understand, right? you are a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) well, you used to be.
(entering from her bedroom) so what do you think? (referring to her outfit)
(to herself) I have still got it!
(pointing at the video) why did you get me this?
what is it?
it is yelling…bleeding…dilating. oh, the dilating…
is this the video of the baby being born? sweetie, this is phoebe’s. why were you even watching it?
i thought…maybe…you got me porn for valentine’s day.
chandler, if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentine’s day… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! apparently, it is about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) oh, wait a minute. those are not stars. anyway, you want to take a look?
well, I am not really in a sexy mood right now.
honey, what is going on?
well, remember the first time we saw jaws?
mm-hmm.
how long it took to go back in the water?
chandler, we can not let this tape wreck valentine’s day!
you do not know. you did not see it.
child-birth, it is a natural thing! it is beautiful.
oh, beautiful? really? beautiful? you think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he is going to throw up!)
oh! oh, my god! no wonder my mother hates me!
see, honey, there is—(puts his hand on her leg)
do not touch me!
hey! (they hug) so, how was atlantic city?
yeah?
wha—? oh, come on. you did not have to—saltwater taffy?! (mona laughs) thanks! this is interesting. you know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it is actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. that is not interesting.
i do too! i missed you!
oh, it was good! it was good. actually, the baby started kicking!
yeah! i know! it was. oh… the only sad thing is i was not around when it happened for the first time.
yeah, I am missing out on all this other stuff, too. so, joey suggested rachel move in with me.
what?
(not amused) huh…uh-huh.
(with his mouth full) just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down)
how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you?
i do not know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
taffy, really? I have never had any.
ever?!
well, i think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (ross hands her one) thank you! so what, you are just never going to tell her?
oh, no, no, no, i will! i just want to butter her up, first! you know, I am going to take her to an amazing valentine’s dinner. do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I am the best boyfriend in the world, then I am going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
if i have not said it before: she is a lucky, lucky lady! so, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (referring to the taffy, which she is been chewing this whole time.) oh, god. is it gum, is it food? what is the deal? (she swallows it, finally) oh, it is nice! may i try a pink one?
so, between her and me being friends, and her history with ross, it just is not going to happen. it would be like you falling in love with a cat.
(entering) hey!
hey.
hey, buddy. how is my favorite dog, huh? how is my favorite dog? (the dog does not move) you are subdued. (to joey) did you give him a beer?
no.
will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
yeah, sure. go ahead. (pause) oh, me, right!
he is miserable! what happened to him?
nothing. we just talked about stuff.
what stuff?
rachel stuff.
oh…joey, you bummed him out! this was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
he is breathing!
okay, I am going to take him back to wendy’s.
no, no, no, no! he is fine! look, look, look! (picks up the ball) here is your ball! get your ball! get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) get your ball! my god, what have i done to you, huh? i broke the dog! pheebs, i broke the dog!
well, I am, uh, going to pick up mona. what have you got going tonight?
oh, I have got big valentine’s plans! I have got my chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
y’know, it is interesting! most people think that is made with seawater, when in fact—
ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
ooh! my chinese food! let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)
(opening the door to see mona standing there) mona? what are—hi! what are you doing here? I am, um, supposed to pick you up!
(he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like…)ayyyayyyy!
(entering) oh, hey, mona!
i have no idea!
I will be watching tv if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)
uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.
i think she is lonely.
i know.
no, no. she is way to emotional. and by emotional i mean crazy.
I am not here! that is just my chinese food!
mm-hmm. she is—she is emotional, but, but ballsy.
you know what I am going to do? I am going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)
and you thought she was going to be in our way! so, why do not you, uh, open the champagne, and I will be right back. I have got a surprise for you.
(fakes a laugh) please start drinking! (exits)
(entering) I am just going to grab the phone.
oh, I am sorry! do you need the phone?
(as ross enters with a present) but, but, mona, i live here.
(handing mona the present) happy valentine’s day! …or something to remember me by.
how long has it been this time?
90 seconds.
that is better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all i did was think about it.
you know, it haunts me? up ‘til now, the worst thing i ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. after this, i would gladly make that my screensaver!
okay, well, we have to get past this! why do not we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
i can do that.
okay.
okay. now all we have got to do is get rid of this chair.
oh, thank god!
oh, i know!
come in!
(entering) hi! I am so sorry to barge in on your valentine’s, but i had to get away from all the yelling. mona is dumping ross.
oh, my god.
poor ross.
oh, great. we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? it is here.
oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: do not watch it.
why? you saw it? is it scary?
well, let us just say it is ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
well, now, wait. now I am all freaked out. come on, you guys will watch it with me.
no, but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
c’mon, seriously, you guys, you are not going to make me watch this alone!
she is right…of course not. honey, get the tape.
(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) okay, here we go.
okay. (watching the tape) ooh, my! (rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) woah! why is that baby torturing that woman?!
why have i seen this thing three times?!
it is…still beautiful.
uh! it is horrible!
i know! i know, I am so sorry for you!
oh, my god!
wait, you guys, look!
what? did her ass explode?!
no, the baby’s out! look, look!
oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
and look how happy the mom is now!
oh…rach!
oh, screw you guys, you do not have to do it!
hey, hey, man!
hey, what is up?
uh…mona just dumped me.
oh, man, I am sorry. why?
well, with everything that is been going on lately, i have not exactly been the perfect boyfriend. you know, i, uh, i did not tell her i got rachel pregnant. i gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me. in a way, i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
still, that really sucks, man. especially on valentine’s day.
yeah. wait a minute. what are you doing here? joey tribbiani without a date on valentine’s day? what is going on, huh? girl trouble?
sort of.
really?!
you do not have to seem so happy about it.
oh, sorry. well, look, maybe i can help you with it.
oh, i…i d—
hey, whatever it is, i am sure it has happened to me. y’know, actually once—once i got dumped during sex.
anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
forget about it. it is no big deal.
c’mon! joey! what is it?
it is nothing.
hey, hey, it is me. why can not you tell me?
okay, uh…sit down. (they do) um… there is this woman that i like. a lot. but, uh…it can not happen.
she is not a tribbiani?
no!
i knew it. so, is she someone from work?
yes.
well, uh, does she like you?
sometimes i think maybe she could. but it does not matter, because i can not do anything about it.
why not?
well, it is complicated. she is with this other guy. for a long time. someone from work, too. and i could never do that to the guy, because we are really good friends.
so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?
no. i do not think so.
okay. um… is he a good guy?
yeah, he is the best.
then talk to him! he might be fine with it.
oh, i do not know.
joey, it is worth finding out. i mean, if you really like her.
i do! so much! i can not stop thinking about her! i can not sleep, i—
okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself.
I am going to…uh…I am going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
oh, yeah.
anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? and tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until…)
it is rachel.
(thinking) you are going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. now, you are going to make yourself watch the whole thing. just do it! (rachel puts the tape in the vcr)
(thinking) hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
(from bedroom) whoaa!!
(going to the bedroom) see joe, that is why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
hey, look at me. I am making jam, been at it since 4 of the clock this morning.
where did you get fruit at four in the morning?
went down to the docks. bet ya did not know you could get it wholesale.
i did not know there were docks.
hey.
hey.
aww, is it broken?
no, i got to wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)
did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
nooo. i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out.
well, I am sorry joe. i did not think the doctor was going to buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
what is this? fruit?
monica's making jam.
whoa, jam! i love jam! (to chandler) hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
because the kids need new shoes.
I am going into business people. I am sick and tired of being depressed about richard. i needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. what is the opposite of man? jam. (sees joey trying some jam from the pot) oh joey do not! it is way to hot. (joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)
this will just be my batch.
(turns around) um, that is it. no. hey! you! j. crew guy. yeah. why have you been following me? i mean, all week long everywhere i look there is you.
what?
oooh. oh, well this is awkward.
um, yeah, you want ursula, and I am phoebe. twin sisters! seriously.
oh, you are not a dingus.
well, i mean look it is, it is not your fault, you know. i mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
wait, (grabs him) you know what, i got a little story. when i was in junior high school i went through this period where i thought i was a witch. and there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that i think will help you a lot. he said okay, 'you are not a witch you are just an average student.' see what I am saying?
um, well, get over it. so, i mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. do not be so hard on yourself okay.
oh, thanks a lot. do you want to get a cup of coffee?
okay. (they start to leave, he is still following her) okay, you do not have to walk behind me any more.
mon?
mon?
(reading) 'gone for more jars. back later. monica geller.'
wait a minute, look.
what?
look, look, look.
what, what, what?
it is an empty apartment.
oooh.
we are all alone in an empty apartment.
honey, come on, i have to be at work in like ten minutes (ross starts kissing her neck) oh, all right, well it is not like I am employee of the year or anything. (they fall onto the couch)
there it is.
oh, oh, that is what you are talking about. (to chandler) hey.
hey.
do i look fat?
okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow.
okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her....
whoa, whoa, whoa. you looked at her. you never look. you just answer, it is just a reflex. do i look fat? nooo! is she prettier than i am? noo! does size matter?
nooo!
and it works both ways.
okay, so you both just know this stuff?
well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kind of catch on.
okay, for instance. let us say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. option number 1 she will take a cab home from the airport. option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. which do you do?
that is easy, baggage claim.
(buzzes) wrong! now you are single. it is actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her.
okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I am all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. so, uh, how do i tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
oh honey, I am sorry we can not help you there, because we are cuddlily sleepers. (chandler makes an 'ewww' face) okay, I am late for work.
oh.
all right are you guys going to come down?
uh, yeah, yeah I will, I am right behind you.
good luck chandler.
thank you rachel.
bye sweetie.
bye hon.
(blows her a kiss) okay the sleeping thing. very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
well, i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
noo! no, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I am like you, i need the room. okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and ross puts his hands on chandler's shoulder and thigh.) okay, you are in bed...
yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
I am going to use the cushion.
yeah.
okay, you are in bed. she is over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. and then you rollll a-way. hug for her! roll for you.
okay, the old hug and roll.
yep.
okay, one question.
shoot.
you are pretending the pillow's a girl right?
remember when you where a kid and your mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
(looks at him) you are so pretty.
(entering) hi!
hey, oh, you know that guy who is been following me? i talked to him today.
(with food in his mouth) you talked to him. are you crazy?
okay, first I am not crazy. and second, say it do not spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he was not following me, i mean he was, but because he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that is why, that is why he could not just come up and talk to me. because of the restraining order.
umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom.
ooh! no, no, no, no, he is not like a kook, no. he is just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. and we just get along really well, and he is so cute.
oh my god, you have got a crush on your sister's stalker.
no, I am just going to help him, you know, get 'de-ursula-ized', like you know, like i did for joey after he went out with her.
(with his mouthful) hey, i did not stalk her. i mean (he sprays phoebe with crumbs)
okay, i asked for the news, not the weather.
(entering) hey guys.
joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) it is blackberry curin.
aww. (tastes it) ohh!
hey, joe, i got to ask. the girl from the xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
put your hands together.
joey, take your time with that. that is my last batch.
no more jam?!
well, what happened to your jam plan?
i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. so, I have got a new plan now. babies.
well, your going to need much bigger jars.
what are you talking about?
I am talking about me having a baby.
what?
are you serious?
yeah. the great thing about the jam plan was, i was taking control of my life. so i asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that is when i came up with the baby plan.
well, are not you forgetin' something? what, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? dad!
it took me 28 years to find one man that i want to spend my life with, if i have to wait another 28 years then, I will be 56 before i can have a baby, and that is just stupid.
that, that is what is stupid.
i do not need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. and there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
down at the docks again?
night-night.....janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. that would be weird though. okay, hug and roll time. I am huggin', I am huggin', your rollin', and....yes! freedom! (his one arm is still under her) except for this arm! I am stuck. stuck arm! okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. quick like a cat, quick like a cat! and 1...2...3!' (pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)
oh, great. great. you are doing great, you know real strong. going strong. keep going.
oh, yeah. what is this? (picks up a book)
um, not even a little bit.
oh, okay then.
good. so what were you thinking?
really?
oh.
oh, okay. (he kisses her)
no, that is all right. i just had a jar of mustard.
(entering from her bedroom) okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! okay, he is 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male geena davis.
you mean there is more than one of us.
look, you can not do this mon. all right, if you do this, I am, I am going to, I am, I am going to.....
you are going to what?
I am going to tell mom.
honey, I am sorry, but he is right. i love you, but you are crazy.
crazy.
what?! why? why is this crazy? so this is not the ideal way to something....
(interrupting her) oh, it is not the ideal way...
lips moving, still talking. i mean it may not be ideal, but I am so ready. no, i-i-i see the way ben looks at you. it makes me ache, you know?
check it out!! jam crackers!
okay, all right, how is this? 27. italian-american guy. he is an actor, born in queens. wow, big family, seven sisters, and he is the only....boy. (they all turn and look at joey) oh my god, under personal comments: 'new york knicks, rule!'
yeah, the knicks rule!
joey, this is you!
let me see. (goes over and looks at the form) oh, right.
when did you go to a sperm bank?
well, right after i did that sex study down at nyu. (to chandler) hey, remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?
and that is how you bought it?
noooo, that is what i was wearing when i donated. I am kind of surprised there is any of my boys left.
well, honey, it is pretty competitive. i mean I have got an actual rocket scientist here.
maybe, i should call this place and get them to put my 'days of our lives' on here. you know, juice this puppy up a little.
(entering) hellooo!
how is the maniac?
oh, well he is yummy. we did a little kissin'.
phoebe, what are you doing?
oh, no, no, no, no. you know what, he is not into that stuff anymore. he quit for me.
pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for god knows how long, okay, you do not just give up something like that.
look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
you are taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
what, he is not still following her. do you think he is still following her?
pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
what are you saying i should do?
i think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
thank you, monica.
orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
oh, that is what i would do, forget mine.
oh my god, what happened? (points to the cast on janice's wrist)
wow! spinning that sounds like fun.
(turns around, not amused) ross's what?
yes? yes! oh.
oh, i was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. oh, here it is! oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)
um, perhaps. yes! yes, I am sorry, I am sorry. i was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. just walkin' along looking like me. what, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
no, no, it is not your fault. you know it is partly my fault, because i made you quit cold turkey. sorry, no. okay, well, i mean, i can not date you anymore, because your, you know (in a high pitched voice) wow! but um, but i will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. okay, stalk me for a while. huh? yeah, and, and, and, I will be like an ursula patch.
yeah, just, okay, look I am going. um, come on. op, op, behind the pillar, which way am i going to go?
hey.
hey.
where you going?
to the bank.
sperm or regular?
sperm.
so you are really doing this, huh?
oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
sounds nice.
'fraid so. brown hair, green eyes...
no kiddin', hmm.
what?
no, i-i figured you would have picked a blond guy.
really? why?
i do not know, i just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... hoyt.
hoyt?
it is a name, yeah. i saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.
really, is he a swimmer?
he is got the body for it.
i like that. (joey starts laughing) what?
you guys have one of those signs that says: 'we do not swim in your toilet, so do not pee in our pool.', you know.
we do not have one of those signs.
sure you do, it was a gift from me. oh! and you have these three great kids.
two girls and a boy?
yeah!
and, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. and they are, they are running around on the deck. then hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
sure! (monica gets very depressed) but hey, you know this way sounds good too.
yeah.
oh monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) wow, this guy's an astronaut. that would have been cool, (sees monica) for like a day. (hugs her again).
i called the sperm bank today, they have not sold a single unit of tribianni. nobody wants my product. i mean, i-i-i do not get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) maybe if they met me in person.
honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)
(wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) did i get it?
yeah.
(entering) hello.
hello.
(sees joey) hey. (walks into the living room) uh, chan, can i uh, can i talk to you for a second?
sure. what is up?
just one uh, one additional relationship thought. probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks chandler over the head with a magazine)
okay, ross, i realise that you did not expect to walk in and see that, but.. let me explain, okay?
we were not doing anything!
rach, he just saw us.
shhh.
but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss.
no, come on, that is a lie. we also kissed in barbados.
yeah, you started it! I have got to chill.
look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
we feel so terrible about this, ross.
yeah, but it did happen, so...
ross?
ross? (to joey) can we just close the door?
ross, say something. anything.
so you two are..?
and have you .. ed?
no, no, no!
no, no, no!
but if i had not walked in here, would you..?
probably.
no, no!
ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. you have every right to go nuts.
I am not going nuts. do you see me go nuts?
no, but you know what i mean.
hey, hey, hey... if you two are happy, then I am happy for you. (squeaky.) I am fine!
really?
absolutely. (very squeaky.) I am fine! totally fine. i do not know why it is coming out all loud and squeaky, because really, (deep voice) I am fine. I am not saying i was not a little surprised to see you guys kissing. i mean, at first i was like.. (screams.) but now that I have had time to absorb it; loving this.
ross..
it is all working out! me & charlie, and you two. you know what we should do?
calm ourselves?
no. we should all have dinner. yes, we will do it tomorrow night. I will cook!!
look, do not you think that will be a little weird?
weird? what? what is weird? the only thing weird would be if someone did not like mexican food, because I am making fajitas!! (storms off.)
i do like fajitas.
god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there is inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
there is a hair in my coffee.
hey guys!
hey.
hey, have you seen frank jr., because he is meeting me here with the triplets.
you know, it is funny. every time you say "triplets," i immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
that is sweet. drink your hair.
hey, what is all this stuff?
oh, they are brochures from different adoption agencies.
ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
that is not really how it works.
oh, how does it work?
i do not know!
well, if you are having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, bill and colleen. they adopted a kid. I am sure they would help you.
thanks, that would be great. hey, honey, would not that be great?
hey!
good to see you.
hi frank.
oh, my goodness, they have all gotten so big!
which one is which again?
ah, can i just say i know we are doing this for ross, and that is cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we would be doing on our first date.
well, what would we be doing?
I would take you out for a romantic night. some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
feel me up?
in a carriage!
hey, charlie!
hey.
oh, you bet.
so, did you bring a little something for ross?
oh. oh, thanks.
yeah, i did not throw any of that out..
i thought i heard voices! hi charlie! (kisses her.) hi joey. (hugs him.) and.. oh! you are going to have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (laughs.) I am just kidding, i know rachel, i know. (he squeezes her hand.) come, please come in. come in.
okay, well, we brought you some wine.
oh! that is so thoughtful. (to joey.) she is a keeper. and what did you bring me? (grabs the bag that charlie brought for joey.)
uh, actually, that is..
underwear, a toothbrush, and van halen cd. i can use all these things!!
what? fine? because i am! are not you? are not you? are not you? you see? who else is fine?
okay, listen, hey, ross. why do not you try to relax, okay? maybe have a drink.
you know what? that is a very good idea. I am going to go make a pitcher of margaritas.
oh, god. so adorable. look at them sleeping there like angels.
well, they may be a handful, but they are so cute.
oh, god, the last time i babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
that is a, that is a long time.
yeah, i know, frank. i counted them when they were coming out of my area.
what?
oh my god, frank, are you thinking of leaving? because i did not have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
what?! you can not separate them! that is terrible. which one?
thank you so much for seeing us. phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
i mean, you have a lovely home.
well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
oh my god!
thank you. (to chandler.) i think i just had a tiny orgasm.
that is great. (to monica.) can i see the book?
you want me to wash my hands first, do not you?
it is.. it is just so pretty and white.
can i adopt you?
hey, you must be owen.
I am chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too.
yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
you know how to use a compass?
you do? that is fantastic!
I would love to, but i got to get back to talking to your parents. they are telling us all about how they adopted you.
what?
i got nothing.
the first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
oh, guys, this is fun, is not it? you know? just the four of us. just hangin'.
dude, are you okay? and when are the fajitas going to be ready?
I am fine! hey, I am great! I am just.. I am just proud of us. there is no weirdness, no tension.
no awareness.
we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together. ooh! let us take a trip. okay, where do you think we - we can go?
my fajitas!!
look, charlie, i just want you to know. ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me. you know, he normally does not drink like this.
fajitas! be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
ross, you do not even have oven mitts on!
that is going to hurt tomorrow!
okay, well, this is crazy. can not seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
insane.
alice would never go for it, right?
well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. which one would you be willing to give up?
frank jr.jr.?
uh-huh.
well, alright, that is fine. what about leslie?
alright, so that leaves chandler.
wow, frank. i think we just ran out of kids.
I am sorry, frank. i did not realise things were so bad. you know, I will help out more. i can - i can babysit any time you want. you name the day, and I will be there.
well, that is not good. but you know, i can move some stuff around, and I will be there. you and alice just take the whole day together.
are you kidding? that is what sisters are for.
where are bill and colleen?
they are in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you believe how nice they are?
we have to leave!!
why? what did you do in the bathroom?
i did not get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way, and he did not know he was adopted. and there is a slight chance i may have told him.
oh my god, where is my purse? no, you know what? i can replace everything in there. get that binder, and let us go!
but kids are so intuitive. do not you think on some level he already knows?
see? intuitive!
which technically now you should give back!
I am so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "owen does not know he is adopted, and he also thinks that santa is real."
everyone? i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey.
ooy.
and to love. ah, love. l-of-v-e, love. l is for life. and what is life without love?
oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
of is for "oh, wow!" the v is for this very surprising turn of events, which I am still fine with by the way. e is for how extremely normal i find it. that you two are together. and now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
dude, are you okay?
totally.
ross, you do not seem okay.
no!
was not it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel.
okay.
oh, that is okay, girls tend not to like me.
okay, i guess it is just flan for three! hey, hey, that rhymed!
you know what, ross? i think we are going to take off too.
oh, oh. of course. god, I am so stupid. you guys are a couple now. i mean, you probably just want to be alone.
no, no, it is just that it is getting late...
hey, hey, it is fine. it is totally fine. we have got plenty of margaritas. it is all good.
i do not even know what that is for.
you know what? i think I am going to stay here and make sure he is okay.
yeah, that is probably a good idea.
yeah. I will see you in the morning.
uh-huh. okay. you know what, joey, i do not think he is ever going to be okay with this.
it does not look good, does it?
morning. here you go.
thanks. did you stay here all night?
yeah.
so you took off my pants and shoes?
no, no, no. you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago-soundtrack. look, ross, about, about rachel and i. listen, you do not have to worry about that, okay? because nothing is going to happen.
what do you mean?
well, she and i said from the beginning that we were not going to do anything unless you were okay with it. and clearly..
hey, what are you talking about? I am fine!
it is okay, ross, alright? i totally understand. of course you are not fine. you are.. you are ross and rachel.
except we are not. i mean, we have not been a couple in like, six years. oh my god, is that right? has it been that long?
that is what i hear, yeah.
this is crazy. i mean, six years? and because of me you guys are not going to be together? can i ask you something? really, what is this thing with you and rachel?
come on, i mean, you know me, you know...
joey.
I am crazy about her.
and she feels the same way?
i think so.
well, then, maybe it is time we all moved on.
yeah, but, ross, i mean, you are not okay with it.
no, but i want to be. hey, i will be. besides, I am with charlie, right? oh my god, I am still with charlie, are not i? i mean, she did not see the dance, did she?
no, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. are you sure about this?
yeah, I am sure.
and we are okay?
hey, phoebs
hey.
uhm, we just want to give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate us.
owen did not know he was adopted, and monica told him.
what?
still, he had to find out sometime.
yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
I am going to go tell emma she was an accident. (runs off.)
(entering) hey!
hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
(to chandler) dude! what are yo—you trying to kill me?!
(entering from her room) pheebs, i want to ask you something.
uh-huh, what?
well since I am movin’ out and-and you are so beautiful…
oh!
…how about i move in with you?
well, that would be great but then what do we do about denise?
who is denise?
my roommate.
you have a roommate?!
yes, denise. denise!
hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute?
pheebs, i do not understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say. i talk about her all the time! denise!!!!!
hey rach, listen i was thinkin’ uh, I am going to have an extra room over at my place…
oh, that is true.
yeah, why do not you move in with me? it will be great! we could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about naked thursday’s right?
yeah, yeah i think I am going to find my own place.
hey-hey! i thought naked thursday’s was just our thing man!
hey.
hey!
so, what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
oh, that. umm, she took it really well.
you did not tell her did you?
no.
of course not, because you are in love with her.
i am not in love with her. she was very upset about having to move out so i eh, did not tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. i-i just comforted her, as a friend.
what do you mean, comforted her?
it is nothing, i just gave her a hug.
ah-ha! a classic sign of love, the hug!
it is also a sign of friendship.
yeah, not in your case lovey loverson. (tries to take a bite out of ross’s cookie.)
(grabs back his cookie) it was a hug!
okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
s-s-smell her hair? what if i did?
ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! that is why, that is why women are shorter. so that men will fall in love when they hug them! (ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) oh come on ross, you are a scientist.
i was hugging her as a friend. it is not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she is got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty. (phoebe raises her eyebrows.) what?! oh, that does not mean i have feelings for rachel! maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts!
(taking his coffee) okay, whatever you say. but just be careful, all right? rachel’s not in the same place you are.
(grabbing back his coffee) if the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place!
okay, i did not understand that, but y’know, maybe that is ‘because you were speaking the secret language of love!
hey! (to chandler) dude, some guy just called for you.
who was it?
i do not know! how about, "thanks for taking the message." jeez! (exits.)
okay listen, y’know when you move in rachel’s room is going to be empty, you want to talk about what we want to do with it?
sure!
okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! okay, whatever, i really have not thought about it that much.
well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones! the big-big ones!
no.
okay so you mean no as in, "gee chandler, what an interesting idea. let us discuss it before we reject it completely."
oh, I am sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
so, that is it?
i just do not think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is going to be filled with antiques.
which is why asteroids is perfect! it is the oldest game!
what do you have against the beautiful guest room?
i do not have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
are you mocking me?
no, I am not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (exits.)
hey, what is up?
nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight.
but you are still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today. (shows him the paper.)
(reading the ad) "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." nice!
yeah? i just figured y’know, after living with you it would be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y’know? someone i can learn from, someone-someone who is different than me. and what is more different than me; a guy who is not 19 than say a girl who is 19? enh? (points to his head.) not just a hat rack my friend!
pheebs, i have to ask you…
shhhhhh! I am swamped right now.
you are just staring into space.
umm, I am trying to move that pencil. (there is a pencil lying on the table.)
this one? (picks it up.)
it worked!
pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. i mean, look at this; (points to one and starts to read it.) "wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." it is just, there is nothing! the city’s full!
wait, no, look at this! (points to one.) (reading) "two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, satan worshipers okay…" oh, yeah, but it is on the ground floor.
(entering) hey!
hey.
rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
yeah! why?
okay, there is this guy, warren, from the museum and he is going on a dig for like two years and he is got this great place he needs to sublet. so uh, you interested?
that sounds great! I would love to live at warren’s!! i love warren! thank you!
do not thank me! if you want to thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (rachel just looks at him.) here is warren’s number.
oh, this is great! i am going to call him right now! (jumps up.) oh, thank you!
okay, you go grab it!
i saw it.
i do not know what you are talking about.
umm, I am talking about that which you already know but will not admit. you love her again; you re-love her!
look, i do not re-love her.
i can not believe you will not just admit it! (pause) okay, just promise me that you will not do anything stupid.
look, we are just friends now! okay? why would i do anything stupid?
(returning from calling warren) ugh!!! well, the apartment is already subletted! i mean, this is just hopeless. I am never going to find anything.
you can live with me.
what?!
what?!
what?
oh my god! are you serious?!
uh-huh. (phoebe grunts.)
i would love to live with you ross; that is-that is great! thank you!
well, I am-I am just glad i could, y’know, help you out.
wow! I am-I am so happy for you guys. (to ross) this is so-so, not stupid.
ross-ross, you have no idea what this means to me! i mean, i mean i was going to be homeless. you just saved me! you are my hero!
hero, i uh, i do not know—well, all right.
oh, i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has! (kisses him on the cheek and exits.)
oh please! (he sits down.) (to phoebe) you are going to say things now, are not ya?
no. no, i will not. but i should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise. she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he did not love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! and that is how she ended up living with me! (ross looks at her.) (pause) okay, that is a lie.
hi.
hi.
hi, listen, I am sorry about before. i do not need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i could not get girls, and now i can ‘them—now, i have you. (monica glares at him.) not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women…
stop it chandler. (chandler is relieved) I am sorry too.
really?
yeah! oh yes!
ohh.
listen, we do not have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
that is a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
totally!
we do not have to come up with this now.
oh good.
hey, y’know what? why do not we think about changes we can make in the living room?
changes?
yeah, i mean we are going to have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (kisses her and heads into the living room.)
you are-you are-you are going to bring the barca lounger over here?
is that a problem?
well, it is a set and they should probably stay together.
oh, that is cool. then I will just bring them both over.
see now-now you are taking them away from their home.
okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours! I will get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
yeah-yeah, y’know what? yeah, that is it-that is it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! that is-that is what i said! oh come on, chandler! I am talking about the barca lounger! it just, it does not match! where is it going to go?!
in the game room!
look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
all right! that is fine! that is fine! i will not bring over the chairs! i will not bring anything over! i would not want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma’s place!! (storms out.)
(exiting from chandler’s room with the new roommate) everything on your application looks really good—ohh! just one last question umm, are you and your friends going to be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
whoa!! now look, do not be just blurtin’ stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?
(entering) you can call off the roommate search! (to the potential roommate) hi! I will be living here. (heads for the bathroom.)
oh do not listen to him, he is just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i do not think he is going to get it.
why did you take the shower curtain down?
that thing was a hazard! (to the potential roommate) I am very safety conscious.
hey!
hey! oh listen, i was just clearing some space for your stuff.
oh thanks, but listen, i was just at monica’s and she and chandler had a big fight and they are not moving in.
what do you mean, they are not moving in? they-they are still moving in right?
no-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
what?! over a stupid room!
yeah, i feel kind of bad for them, but I am also really psyched ‘because i do not have to move in here!
oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!
what is all this about you guys fighting?! is this really over a room?! i mean, that is so silly!
ross, we can handle this.
well, apparently not, and i can not just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!
well, why do not you tell her to stop being silly! (monica mocks him and he joins in.)
(stopping them) okay-okay! two very good points, look I have known you both a long time, and I have never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you have been since you have got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly. now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?
well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
love is the best medicine.
that is laughter.
why do you do it?
i do not know.
okay! all right! now, chandler you-you want to live with monica, right?
yeah, i do.
and mon, you want to live with chandler, do not ya?
yes.
(jumping up) good! a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york! (storms out.)
no-no, I am staying put.
why, where are you going?
(entering) hey rach!
hi!
you are never going to believe it uh, monica and chandler are moving in again. that is great news right—i mean for them. right?
oh wow.
yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
yeah. y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but do not you think it is going to be weird?
wh-why?! why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
well, because of us! because of our history.
no!
no?
no! no! it would be weird if we were still in that place, i mean are you still in that place?
no! not at all!
good! me neither! so it is not a problem. we are just two friends who happen to be roommates.
okay, but ross, eventually you and i are going to be dating.
really?! we are?
yeah! I am going to have a boyfriend, you are going to have a girlfriend…
ohh! that would be great.
but y’know what, if you think it is going to be okay we will just work out a system. y’know, it will be like college, I will hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "come back later, I am gettin’ lucky." (laughs.)
(laughs as well, but for a different reason) yeah, i did not think of that.
so are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! i mean it is a really big step! and-and what is the rush?!
that is very funny!
he is being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
no, i-i-I am serious, okay? i mean, think about it. you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!
ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
okay, there are no stupid fights!! this is not about the room, this is about what the room…represents! and unfortunately, this room (points to rachel’s room) could destroy you!!
yeah, I am not so worried.
yeah, no, me neither.
fine! it is your life! (starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) i just do not want to see you guys break up! which you will do if you move in together, (monica and chandler just stare at him.) but that is what you want, there is nothing i can do. (opens the door and tries one more time.) do not do it!!!!! (finally leaves.)
you still want to move in together right?
of course!
ross did not scare you?
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
come here, i want to show you something!
okay!
oh my god! someone is killed square man!
this is where i thought the barca lounger could go! you see you could see the tv and it is still walking distance to the kitchen.
oh that is so sweet! i want to show you something too!
okay!
y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge?"
uh-hmm.
y’know? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. because, that is you and i together! merge!
oh my god! i love that!
really?!
uh, no!!
(singing) i found you in my bed!
now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so i can buy a computer.
(to rachel) so umm, where are the other guys?
umm, well let us see monica and chandler are occupied.
fighting?!
no, the other thing. i really think it is great they work things out.
yeah. there is no breaking them up, is there?
hey, can i borrow the key to your house so i can run across the street and make a copy?
sure! here. (hands her his keys.)
thank you. (gets up) now are you sure? because once i make a copy, there is no turning back.
yeah, I am-I am sure. (deadpan) yeah, get out of here before i change my mind. (she exits)
umm, listen, ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea?
I have been back and forth.
yeah well, maybe you should go back! okay? rachel moves in, and before you know it you are right where you do not want to be! back together!
ehh, i do not, i do not think so. she is already talked about y’know, dating other guys.
that is not going to work out! then she is going to come home all weepy and you will be tellin’ her, "oh that is okay. you will find someone." and then, bamn! she finds you!
yeah, well, m-maybe you are right.
i am telling you ross, she is definitely going to fall in love with you again! now, is that what you want?
is that what i want?
(on the microphone, accidentally) yes.
here she comes. hold on, I am going to make your life much easier.
all right, well the place was closed. I will just copy it later.
or not. uh, rach, why do not you just move in with me? (rachel sighs.)
whoa! whoa! whoa, joey!
no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… it is okay, i mean i—look rach, i know i scared you off with that whole naked thursday’s thing, but we do not have to do that!
well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. wait a minute, unless you are thinking about naked wednesday’s.
thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
(opening the door to the potential roommate) hi!
come in. thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but i have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
okay now, before i make my final decision i uh, i just want to make sure our personalities match. okay, so i made up a little test. now, I am going to say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
okay! here we go. pillow.
very good! okay. g.
excellent! okay umm, doggy.
ooh, sorry! no-no-no, so close though, but—bye-bye! (he ushers her out the door.)
(entering) hi!
hey!
hey!
so what is the final head count on my baby shower?
about twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
what?! you mean they are not coming to a social event where there is no men and there is no booze?! that is shocking! i do not care, as long as my mom’s here.
oh my god, your mother!
what?! my mom’s not going to be here?!
well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
my god!
well it was not my fault, phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
well i do not, i do not have a mother so often i forget that other people…
(interrupting her) oh give it a rest!
so my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
no. (pause) neither is mine.
okay, y’know what? do not worry, okay? we will take care of it. we will call her. just go home and get ready.
please, make sure she comes. it is really important to me, i mean it is my mom!
i know. i know, what is her number?
i do not know.
go! i have it in my book. go! (rachel leaves and monica calls mrs. green.) (to phoebe) wait a minute! if you are in charge of the invitations why am i the one who has to call her—hello mrs. green! hi, it is monica geller.
(on phone) hi, umm i know this is last minute, but we have decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for rachel today.
yeah, I am sorry. I am-I am so sorry.
(to phoebe) oh my god, my ass is sweating! (on phone) please! please! can you come? it is today at four.
thank you. (hangs up.)
is not it at three?
son of a bitch! (calls mrs. green again.)
hey joe! you want to shoot some hoops?
oh no, i can not go. I am practicing; i got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
oh cool!
that is great.
yeah-yeah, and if i get it by day I will (in a sexy voice) dr. drake remoray, but by night I will be (in an announcer’s voice) joey trrrribbiani!
you will be perfect for this! that is already your name!
but the audition’s in a couple hours and i do not even understand the game.
well do you want some help?
oh really? that would be great! you guys can be the contestants!
awesome!
okay, i guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
(announcer voice) all right! let us play bamboozled!
bamboozled?
yeah, is not that a cool name?
(simultaneously with chandler) yeah!
(simultaneously with ross) no!
all right. uhh, okay. our first contestant is ross geller. why do not you tell us a little something about you ross?
well uh, i-I am a paleontologist. umm, i-i live in new york. i have a son ben. uh, hi ben! (waves.) and uh…
i said a little bit ross. now, how about you chandler?
well joey, I am a headhunter. i hook up out of work soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. hi rasputin! (waves.)
excellent! let us play bamboozled! chandler, you will go first. what is the capital of columbia?
bogota.
it is ba-go-ta, but close enough. now, you can either pass your turn to ross or pick a wicked wango card.
what does a wicked wango card do?
i should know that. let us see, just one moment please. umm, here we are, a wicked wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
higher or lower than what?
this is embarrassing. (looks it up.)
(to ross) can you believe how lame this is?
I am sorry, i do not believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
oh, i told the stripper to be here at five. that is good right?
you ordered a stripper for the shower?! that is totally inappropriate!
what? he is going to be dressed as a baby! (mrs. green enters.) oh hi mrs. green!
hi!
I am so glad you could make it.
yes, thank you so much. and again, we are so sorry. we could not feel worse about it.
she is still mad.
yeah i know. is not it great? one less person we have to make small talk with.
phoebe, sandra’s mad at you too. it-it does not bother you?
no look, we have apologized twice! i can not do anymore than that. i know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
okay. i can do that. (pause) i got to go powder my ass.
okay. (mrs. green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
oh well actually going to use a nanny and uh, i do not even have a housekeeper.
mrs. kay! oh yeah, she was sweet. she taught me spanish. i actually think i remember some of it, tu madre es loca. (i think that is your mother’s crazy.)
well, however great she was i just can not afford that.
what?
wh-wh-what? what?
yes. yes i do.
all right ross you are in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the wheel of mayhem?
the wheel has not been my friend tonight joey. uh, I will take another question.
okay, this is going to be tough. hold your breath.
it is okay, I am ready.
no dude, you got to hold your breath until you are ready to answer the question.
this is ridiculous, he is not going to hold his breath… (ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, tris…holy cow, that is a big word. trisc… seriously look at this thing. chandler, how do you say that?
let me see that.
this one right here. (ross whines.)
triscadecaphobia.
(exhaling) the fear of triscuts!
no! no, fear of the number 13.
fear of triscuts?
it is possible, they have really sharp edges.
all right chandler, you are up.
wait a minute, i-i believe I am entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn?
this game makes no sense!
y’know what? you are just upset because you are losing.
oh come on ross, i think we are all losers here.
all right. chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card.
let me think. let me think—oh! i do not care.
you-you must choose mr. bing.
either, it makes no difference.
choose, you jackass!
I will take a card.
okay, you picked the gimmie card! you get all of ross’s points!
what?!
this game is kind of fun.
(to chandler) you do not think it is a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘because you…
i do not think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
why did you invite my mother?!
what?
she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby.
for how long?
eight weeks. i mean i love my mother, but my god, a long lunch with her is taxing.
i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
she can not hear you.
what? you guys, come on! what am i going to do?
well, if you do not want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
you are right. you are right. i mean I am about to have a baby, i can tell my mother that i do not want her to just be sleeping on my couch! oh my god! she is going to want to sleep in my bed with me. this cannot happen!
that is right. that is right, you go over there and tell her you do not want her to live with you. do not take no for an answer!
okay. (she goes over to tell her mother.)
(to phoebe) this is great! now she is going to be mad at rachel! y’know what? and I am just going to swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
i have new respect for chandler. all right everybody! it is time to open the presents!
yes! yes! and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you are the most important person in this room. and in the world!
how about you less important people, let us open your presents!
mom that is okay that you did not get you a gift!
oh yeah. okay, see mom, the truth is i can do this on my own.
but mom, i really know what I am doing. i can handle this.
he was a hamster! i am not going to vacuum up my baby!
okay, come on rach it is present time! y’know you are the glue that is holding this whole party together. it is kind of falling apart here.
wow!
okay, this is from your friend at work.
oh my gosh! oh wow! oh, i know what this is! (she is holding an item with a large suction cup connected to a yellow plastic box, with a long narrow tube and bottle connected the yellow part.) wait a minute. that can not be right. is that a beer bong for a baby?
did i say i was done guessing? okay, thank you for that. oh wow! what is this?
oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
well that is gross, why do not you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
what?! it goes ten times a day! what are we feeding this baby?! indian food?!
rachel, listen to your mother. she is very smart.
i do not know, I would leave it on the changing table? (everyone gasps.) what?! what did i do? what did i do?!
oh come—(stutters)—of course i know that. i mean of course you never leave a baby alone! i mean who would—she would not be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. oh god, okay. y’know what? i think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. so i think umm, I am just going to maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. and for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
okay mommy, do not ever leave me. (hugs her.)
(to chandler) in what john houston film would you hear this line, "badges? we do not need no stinkin’ badges!"
treasure of the sierra madre!
correct! there is a possible backwards bonus!
madre sierra the of treasure!
yes!
I would like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
wise choice, how many rungs?
six!
(makes a sound like a monkey) that noise can only me one thing.
(disappointed and simultaneously as ross) hungry monkey.
(excited and simultaneously as chandler) hungry monkey! (to chandler) haaa! (to joey) I would like a wicked wango card!
okay, it is an audio question, name this television theme song. (starts humming the theme to i dream of genie.)
(thinking) oh. (pause) oh! oh my god! okay, i know this, give me-give me a second!
tell it to the time turtle!
shut up! i dream of genie!
yes! yes, you are back in the lead!
I would like to spin the wheel!
(annoyed) oh come on!!
all right! all right! uh, umm, super-speedy speed round!
is there a hopping bonus?
of course!
who invented bifocals?
ben franklin.
correct! which monarch has ruled great britain the longest?
queen victoria.
correct again! but, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
noooo!!! every time!!!
now, over to chandler.
I would like a google card.
are you sure?
yes! (pause) no! (pause) google!
oh my god! congratulations ross, because chandler, you have been bamboozled!
nooo!!
yeah!!
this is the best game ever!!!
so umm, you are going to stay with me as long as i need you?
oh mom, i swear I am not an idiot. I have read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but i-i just did not think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. and-and then guess what? the baby’s coming and i do not know what to do. oh, can i throw up in my diaper genie?
wait-wait where are you going? where are you going?
okay.
it is going to be okay! (mrs. green glances over her shoulder and glares at monica while she heads for the bathroom.) it was worth a shot.
(entering, out of breath) hey!
hey! why are you all red and sweaty?
i just bamboozled chandler! (flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) which is not uh sexual thing. that was a quick shower.
not if you were here.
wow! it looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
(excited) a play-dough barber shop?
no. she is going to live with us for eight weeks.
uh, what?
yes! she is going to help us take care of the baby! woo-hoo. (sees that ross is not happy.)
what—you are not serious. i mean she is a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. she will drive us totally crazy.
hi roomie! (hugs her and looks at rachel.)
(announcer voice) it is a pleasure to meet you ray.
(announcer voice) rightie-of ray!
(to the camera) hello, I am joey tribbiani! let us play bamboozled! erin, you get the first question! in hockey, who is known as the great one?
correct! now, would you like to pick a wicked wango card or spin the wheel of mayhem?
what—why?!
well what is complicated? you spin the wheel of mayhem to go up the ladder of chance. you go past the mud hut through the rainbow ring to get to the golden monkey; you yank his tail and boom! you are in paradise pond!
well what is fun about that? you expect me to be the host of a boring game that is just people standing around answering questions?
(announcer voice to the camera) let us play bamboozled!
well we…we do not have a garage.
y’know what? maybe, mrs. green, it is not absolutely vital that you live with us.
i do. i really do. i do not know anything.
I am-I am sure that is not true.
oh no? pheebs? monica? do i know anything about babies?
no, not a thing.
it is frightening.
well uh, y’know what? even if she does not know anything, i do! i have a son. and his mother and i did not live together, and whenever he was with me i took care of him all the time, by myself.
yeah.
that is a different issue. uh, the point is, when the baby comes i will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. and more than that i want to do all those things.
yes! yes, you are going to be so missed.
well you are going to be a wonderful grandma. (they hug.)
hello?! i still do not know what the hell I am doing!
oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. you will—you are going to pick it up. (rachel does not believe that.) hey! you will! uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? you were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. do you remember?
i hope you are going somewhere with this.
look at you! what—you are-you are this big executive! you are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. i-i have no doubt you are going to be an incredible mother.
really?
I am telling you.
thank you. (hugs him.)
oh. (rachel and he start to stand up.)
(laughs) you are still so funny. you are so funny. (to phoebe) what do i do?
nothing! you have apologized to her like a million times and she is been nothing but terrible to you. and do not forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she has not even thanked you for it.
y’know what? you are-you are right.
yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her, I would tell her off.
really?
uh-huh!
okay! i will! mrs. green? mrs. green! (she ignores monica and monica follows her out into the hall with phoebe in tow.) it is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! now what i did to you, it was not on purpose! but what you are during to me now is just plain spiteful!
that is right! maybe it is time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!
(to monica) wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…
so whenever you are ready to apologize to me, i will forgive you. good day! (monica and phoebe reenter the apartment and monica closes the door on a stunned mrs. green.) i can not feel my legs!
you were fantastic! I am so proud of you!
yeah? I am proud of me too.
you should be!
yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
you got it!
okay. (when phoebe turns around monica runs out into the hall after mrs. green.) mrs. green! okay I am really sorry!! I am apologizing for the—(she trips and falls down the stairs.) (pause) okay, i bit my tongue, but I am still really sorry!
(closing a book) okay! I am ready.
you sure?
yes, I have done my studying and i really know my stuff.
all right then. (gets up, in an announcer’s voice) rachel green! let us play bamboozled! (reading from a note card.) how do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
uh, put your elbow in it.
excellent! how do you put a baby down for a nap?
full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
that is correct! this is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound? (makes a sound like someone is choking a cat.)
check if it is wet, check if it is hungry, burp it!
excellent! excellent, now-now do you want another question or a wicked wango card?
a card! a card! i pick a card!
oh, I am sorry you have been bamboozled! you are going to be a terrible mother! (rachel stares at him agape.) I have lost sight of why we are doing this! (rachel gets up and walks away.)
I am glad you are here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
(starting to cry) ohh…
what is the matter? you okay?
yeah, it is just y’know…
(to ross) monica said wedding.
uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
oh! i would love to read a poem.
do you think you could get through a poem?
(crying) it will be a short one.
okay, so ross will be doing the reading.
ohhh…
okay. yeah, i guess, i guess i could do that too.
too?
yeah, i kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
do you mind telling us what it is?
sorry, I am kind of keeping this one on the q.t.
well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking. (winks in a spy-type manner.)
(entering, excited) hey!
so i just talked to one of the dool writers today, and…
what is dool?
days of our lives. anyway, you are not going to believe it! my character is coming out of his coma!!
that is great!
and-and-and not only that, I am gettin’ a new brain!!
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
wait, what do you mean you are getting a new brain?
oh well, they are killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
what? a brain transplant?!
(seriously) yes, it is a highly controversial procedure.
it is ridiculous!
well, i think it is ridiculous that you have not had sex in three and a half months.
(to monica and rachel) it is winter, they are fewer people on the street. (rachel and monica smile and nod, knowingly.)
who are they killing off?
uh cecilia monroe, she plays jessica lockhart.
she is my favorite character on dool.
nice.
she is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, i mean i do not think I have ever seen her finish a beverage.
and the way she slaps all the time!
oh!
would not you love to do it just once?! (raises her hand towards chandler.)
do not do it.
cecilia monroe man, what a great actress.
oh, tell me about it. and she is been on the show forever, it is going to be really hard to fill her shoes.
yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
yes, but in drake remoray’s body. (ross laughs unbelievably.) why is this so hard for you to get? i thought you were a scientist!
(clears throat) rach, so, that guy there. straight or gay?
(they both look behind them.) well, I would have to say gay.
yeah? why?
well mainly because he is kissing that other guy.
oh no not that guy there. that guy right there. (pointing to an attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
oh yeah he is too cute to be straight.
(a woman with large breasts walks in the door) ohh knockers will help us figure it out. (she walks by and he checks her out.)
all right, straight, and not subtle. (the man gets up and leaves.)
ohh, he left his cell phone.
oh, well, we can hand it to gunther and he will put it in lost and found.
or we could use it to call china. see how those guys are doing.
what if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love. i mean would not that be a great story? kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
yeah… that does sound great. I am going to get the phone. (they both get up.)
what? wait! why…why do you get the story?
i do not know. i have not been out on a date in so long.
phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
that was not a date! that was, that was just friends getting together…(quietly) having sex.
okay. okay, see? i get the phone.
no way! no way! you just broke with tag a week ago.
yeah! (breaking up) and until now, i did not think I would love again.
nice try.
oh hey-hey wait! how do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
i do not know.
well umm, maybe we could uhh… (grabs the phone) ah-ha! too slow!!
ah-ha! too cocky!
that was a great scene! and-and-and that slap looks so real! how do you do that?
oh anyway, i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are.
say what?
no. no, I am joey tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. i-I am the guy in the coma!
an-an-anyway i-i just wanted to say that since I am getting your brain when you leave the show, i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…
(quickly) i do not know. why? did you hear something?
oh uh, one of the writers.
umm…
okay.
ms. monroe… (she slaps him) oh there you go. (she storms off, leaving joey standing next to dina. they share a nod at the ferocity of the slap they just received.)
no phoebe! you cannot get the phone that way; that is not fair! okay look, i have an idea. why do not we, why do not we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. and then whoever does gets the phone.
or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
i do not think so.
(handing rachel the phone) fine all right, but I would bet you would be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
(checking the speed dial) all right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
ohh, i lost my mom to suicide.
okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
did i use that already today? I am sorry.
yes okay. (checking the speed dial again.) well now see this is not telling us anything. (reading the speed dial) joe. carlos. peter. ooh! peter luger! t hat’s a steak house!
okay, a meat eater. fine, that is one for you.
(looking at the speed dial) oh, i win! he is got barney’s on his speed dial.
so you do not know that is barney’s the store! that can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. who has barney’s the store on their speed dial?
(showing phoebe her phone) his new girlfriend!
what is that?
i think it is the dying cat parade.
it sounds like it is coming from across the street.
(turning around and looking) oh my god!
what?
y’know that thing that ross was going to do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "you are half scottish right?"
nooo!!
yes!!
no, there is no way! it can not be ross! (she looks through the window and sees ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) unbelievable! why is your family scottish?!
why is your family ross?!
he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! it is not even a song!
if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang.
hi pheebs!
hi!
how are ya?
good.
umm pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that i was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?
yeah.
and remember how i said i was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang i could just pick it up?
yeah!
and do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
ooh, now you lost me.
you stole the phone!
no i did not!
no? so you are saying that if i called it, it would not ring?
no.
umm, okay. but while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. (rachel dials her phone and phoebe’s bag starts to ring.) oh, it does work! (rachel grabs the phone and takes it out of phoebe’s handbag.)
phoebe!
that is a different phone.
oh is it?! (she answers the cute guy’s phone.) uhh, hello? (on her phone) yes hi, is rachel there? (on the other phone) yes she is, just one moment please. (to phoebe, holding out both phones.) it is for me!
that is damning evidence.
oh my god! i bet that is him. my digital fairy tale is about to begin. i wonder how i should be? should i be uh (in a sexy voice) hello? or should i be (happily) hi! it is rach… (phoebe knocks the phone out of rachel’s hand, catches it, and answers it.) would you stop doing that?!
(on phone) hello? (listens) yes, I am the one who found your phone.
phoebe! you can not do th…
(to rachel) shhh! I am on a call! (on phone) umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? at-at my apartment. it is umm, it is umm 5 morton street, apartment 14, umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. (listens) okay, well okay I will see you then. (listens) bye. (hangs up.)
you do know that i will be here when he comes over.
oh? and how will you know what time to come over?
you just said it!
oh. okay, well i-i was kind of hoping that i would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
oh phoebe!
what?! that is the first time today!
ohh! (exits.)
so you like the nachos uh? myself I am partial to…
see you in 2003. (she walks away.)
I am so sorry. look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
no i mean it! i can not believe they would do this to you! and to your fans! i mean they are going to be devastated! heart broken! they love you so much!
joey.
uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that i, that i came up to you before was because well, I am really nervous about-about being you. y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. y’know? help me keep jessica alive. please?
oh that is great! oh thank you so much!
hey! now, I have been watching some tapes, how is this? (in a british accent.) "jessica lockhart will never step foot in this place again! ever!!"
yeah.
(shocked) i can do an english accent?! that baby’s going on my resume!
well, i feel like a snack!
do you want some shortbread? eh that is scottish like you are.
oh no thanks. i do not like any thing from my scottish heritage.
what?!
well it is just my entire family was run out of scotland by…vikings. anyway, lots of bad memories. (makes a few unintelligible noises.)
oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its scottish roots.
no! no-no they are not. they are still very angry! but y’know chandler is also half-swedish. you know what the swedish people are famous for? sitting down and being quiet.
well yeah-yeah the scottish history is so much more…
(interrupting) you can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
how did you know about that?!
we heard you play all the way from your apartment!
were you the ones called the cops?!
that is not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just do not feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
why not?
because we hate them.
come on that is not fair! i mean you have not even heard me play!
we have heard you play.
no, you have heard my practice. okay? just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. and I am not going to tell you what song I am going to play either. but uh, let us just say when it is over I will bet there will be a we bit of celebration.
okay! (he scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed) all right!
okay. okay. (he goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
oh well—hey-hey! maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. y’know? it will-it will give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. you are so talented.
hey that is not true! look at uh, look at angela lansb—angelina jolie!
like-like what?
(impressed) wow!
oh hey come on, do not-do not-do not do this! umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? now when i watch you do a scene, I am thinking, "boy, she-she is a great actress!" (she is not buying it.) uh but-but, i am also thinking, "she is hot!"
you own the room. (she smiles and stares longingly into his eyes.) we should probably get-get uh…
yeah-yeah, i noticed that! is that ‘because she is so passionate?
yeah! okay. (he puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
hey! hey!
whoa! why do you get to answer the door?
well why should not i?!
because it is my apartment!
well, then i get to give him the cell phone.
okay. all right. (hands her the phone.) good luck explaining all the calls to china.
(to rachel) wow! how long were we arguing for?
(laughs) you are not the man who left the cell phone.
is-is he coming? (looks hopefully out the door.)
could you-could you umm, give us one second?
we will be right back sir.
wh-what do we do?
i do not know!
can you believe this? (rachel exhales in amazement.) we were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
i know! (realizes what phoebe said.) what?!
hmm, they just do not make ‘them like that anymore!
(turning and looking at tom again) no-no they do but, you just have to wait.
rachel, listen—i mean, if you let me have him then i will really owe you one.
(fake disappointment) all right. all right phoebe i will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
yeah! you are such a great friend!
ohh…
oh that would be me. sir. (hands him the cell phone.) after you.
(whispering) nice!
actually i rent the whole place and, i just got what you meant. thank you.
hi.
hey!
oh my god! oh my god!! ohh, jessica lockhart!! in my apartment!! i am such a huge fan! i am such a huge fan!
(screaming) monica!!!! monica!!!! (runs to monica’s.)
that uh, that is my roommate rachel.
(shrugs) sure. yep.
(entering with rachel) oh my god! it is true!! oh my god you are so amazing! oh my god, can i just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
would you slap me? would you slap me right here in the face?! (points to her cheek.)
god. you seem really, really nice.
okay, bye-bye.
i mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
all right, here we go. (he grabs them and starts to pull them out of the apartment.)
okay.
(breaks away) oh wait, just one more thing! one more minute! (to cecilia) umm, you are a stupid bitch.
you are so beautiful.
nice to meet you! my god you are great!
thanks for stopping by. see ya! (throws them out and closes the door.) (to cecilia) i-i am so sorry. i…
(notices something in the mail that rachel brought in) oh my god!
they sent me today’s script! they never send the script!
well no, I am just in a coma. this must mean i have lines! (realizes what that means.) oh…
(flipping to the last page) ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
yeah well, I am guessing after this she is not going to be crazy about electricity either.
…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
(giggles) (to ross) i can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
(to rachel) do you want to start telling secrets?
no!
(stands up) now umm, remember I am still learning.
one, two, three, four!
you know the song! sing along!
so?
(as jessica) i do not think so.
oh noo…
thanks!
great! hey! all right! well-well what is it?!
the airport?
ohh. wow! well how-how, how will you be gone?
that is a really long time.
well i tell ya, i should probably buy a place in the city first. (realizes.) and i just got what you meant again—that is—i tell ya, that is a tricky one!
good luck.
you know the song! sing along!
eeee!!! eee!! eee!!
uh, rach, we are running low on resumes over here.
do you really want a job with popular mechanics?
well, if you are going to work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
hey, look, you guys, I am going for anything here, ok? i cannot be a waitress anymore, i mean it. I am sick of the lousy tips, I am sick of being called 'excuse me...'
rach, did you proofread these?
uh... yeah, why?
uh, nothing, I am sure they will be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.
(upset) oh my goood! oh, do you think it is on all of them?
oh no, I am sure the xerox machine caught a few.
hey, guys.
hey... hi, ladies... uh, can i get you anything? (to monica, quietly): did you bring the mail?
lots of responses.
(to monica): really? (out loud): sure, we have scones left! (to monica): ok, read them to me.
(reading): dear ms. green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... (crumples up letter)
(out loud): we have apple cinnamon...
(reading): ok... dear ms. green... yeah... yeah... yeah... no. (crumpes up letter)
wow!
what?
(reading): your visa bill is huge!
(grabs the bill) give me that!
you know, i can not believe you. linda is so great! why will not you go out with her again?
i do not know.
is this still about her whole 'the flintstones could have really happened' thing?
no, it is not just that. it is just—i want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at rachel)
...little playthings with yarn?
what?
could you want her more?
who?
(sarcastically) dee, the sarcastic sister from what is happening.
look, i am totally, totally over her, ok, i just... (rachel comes over, ross lays head on table): hiiii!
hi! how are you?
we are fine, we are fine.
ok. (walks away)
shut up!
we are not—we are not saying anything.
what?
uhhhh... joey cried last night.
thank you.
(to the girls) we were playing poker, alright...
there was chocolate on the three. it looked like an eight, alright?
oh, guys, you should have seen him. 'read  them and weep.'
and then he did.
well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
yeah, what is that? like, some kind of guy thing? like, some kind of sexist guy thing? like it is poker, so only guys can play?
no, women are welcome to play.
oh, ok, so then what is it? some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
there just do not happen to be any women in our games.
yeah, we just do not happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
really.
i mean, that is a typical guy response.
excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
but you could teach us.
(teaching) ok, so now we draw cards.
so i would not need any, right? because i have a straight.
oh, good for you!
congratulations!
ok phoebs, how many do you want?
ok, i just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
no. no, uh, phoebs? you can not—you can not do...
oh wait, i have the ten of spades! here! (gives it to phoebe)
no, no. uh... no, see, uh, you-you can not do that.
oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that is ok, i do not need them. I am going for fours.
oh, you are... (gives up)
alright, here we go. we have got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
whoa, whoa, whoa, monica, what are you doing? this is a poker game. you can not serve food with more than one syllable. it is got to be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)
(changing subject) ok, so at this point, the dealer...
alright, you know, we got it, we got it. let us play for real. high stakes... big bucks...
alright, now, you sure? phoebe just threw away two jacks because they did not look happy...
but... I am ready, so, just deal.
ok, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) joey... three... eight. eight... three. (joey is unamused) alright babe, deal the cards.
(throws down her cards) dammit, dammit, dammit!
(to joey): oh i see, so then, you were lying.
about what?
about how good your cards were.
heh... i was bluffing.
a-ha! and... what is bluffing? is it not another word for... lying?
ok, sorry to break up this party, but I have got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... (gets up to leave)
rach, rach, we got to settle.
settle what?
the... jamestown colony of virginia. you see, king george is giving us the land, so...
the game, rachel, the game. you owe us money for the game.
oh. right.
you know what, you guys? it is their first time, why do not we just forget about the money, alright?
hell no, we will pay!
ok, monica? i had another answer all ready.
and you know what? we want a rematch.
well that is fine with me. could use the money.
(to ross): so basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
(pause)...yeah.
yes, and i get my ya-yas from ikea. you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
look, rachel, this is poker. i play to win, alright? in order for me to win, other people have to lose. so if you are going to play poker with me, do not expect me to be a 'nice guy,' ok? because once those cards are dealt... (claps hands three times)
(pause)...yeah?
I am not a nice guy.
alright boys, let us eat.
oh, did you get that from the 'i love rachel' pizzeria?
you still on that?
oh, come on. what was with that whole black bart speech? (mimicking): "when i play poker, I am not a nice guy!"
you are way off, pal.
no, i do not think so, see ross, because i think you love her.
um.... no. see, i might have had feelings for her at one time—not any more. i just—i...
marcel! where are you going with that disc?
you are not putting that on again! marcel, ok—if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.
(opening mail) can you believe what a jerk ross was being?
yeah, i know. he can get really competitive.
ha. ha, ha.
what?
oh, hello, kettle? this is monica. you are black.
please! i am not as bad as ross.
oh, i beg to differ. the pictionary incident?
that was not an incident! i-i was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
oooooh. (reads letter) (surprised): oh! i got an interview! i got an interview!
you are kidding! where? where?
(in disbelief): sak's... fifth... avenue.
oh, rachel!
oh, it is like the mother ship is calling you home.
well, what is the job?
assistant buyer. oh! i would be shopping... for a living!
ok, look. that is aunt iris. this woman has been playing poker since she was five. you got to listen to every word she says. (opens door) hi!
no.
i do not think so.
why?
what?
oh my god!
really?
thank y... (thinks about it)
uh, aunt iris? this is phoebe, and that is rachel...
ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
alright.
I am going to pay for that tonight.
hi!
hey.
guys! guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!
um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they are all recommending trident?
noooo... the interview! she loved me! she absolutely loved me. we talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and—oh, i went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. i can do this. i can do this well!
oh god, oh, and then she told the funniest story...
ok, great. you will tell us and we will laugh. let us play poker.
alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you do not want to play, we completely understand.
oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, i do not know... pictionary?
ha, ha, very funny, very funny. but i think we would like to give poker another try. shall we, ladies?
uh, rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
no, no, that is ok. y'know, i think I am going to give it a go.
alright.
alright... (shuffles cards expertly, all the guys stare in amazement)
so, phoebs owes $7.50, monica, you owe $10, and rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
but hey, thanks for teachin' us cross-eyed mary. you guys, we got to play that at our regular game.
alright, here is my $7.50. (hands them the money) but i think you should know that this money is cursed.
what?
oh, i cursed it. so now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
that is alright, I will take it. bad things happen to me anyway. this way i can break  them up with a movie.
well, that just leaves the big green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
mmm-hmmm. oh, so typical. ooo, I am a man. ooo, i have a penis. ooo, i have to win money to exert my power over women. (hands over her money)
you know what? this is not over. we will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
hmm. kind of stepped on my point there, mon.
so, you gals want to hand over your money now? that way, we do not have to go through the formality of actually playing.
ooooh, that is fine. we will see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
ok, we done with the chit-chat? are we ready to play some serious poker?
(holding a card and waving it in front of her face) hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever i go. (they look at her) right, ok, serious poker.
excuse me, where are you going?
uh... to the bathroom.
do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you want to play poker?
i want to go to the bathroom. (exits)
alright, well, I am going to order a pizza. (gets up)
oh no-no-no-no-no, I am still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then.
that is fine. I will just have a tic-tac to hold me over.
alright, cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. (deals cards)
(looks at her cards) yes! (everyone looks at her) .... or no.
alright. (to rachel): your money's mine, green.
your fly is open, geller. (he checks it, and zips up)
you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?
hey, that is... that is 'joincidence' with a 'c'!
uh... phoebe? phoebe?
yeah. um... I am out. (throws in cards)
I am in.
me too.
me too. alright, whattaya got.
well, you better hop outta the shower, because... i got to flush. (lays down cards)
well, well, well, hop back in bucko, because i got four sixes! (lays down cards) i won! i actually won! oh my god! y'know what? (collects chips) i think I am going to make a little ross pile. (holds up a chip) i think that one was ross's, and i think—oh—that one was ross's. yes! (starts singing): well, i have got your money, and you will never see it...
and your fly's still open...
ha, i made you look....
i could not be inner. monica?
monica, in or out?
(slams down cards) i hate this game!
ok joey, your bet.
ahhh, i fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. (the girls look at him, confused) oh, I am out.
ross?
oh, i am very in.
chandler?
could not be more out. (throws in cards)
me too. rachel.
uh, i will see you... and I will raise you. (throws chips in pot) what do you say... want to waste another buck?
no, not this time. (he folds) so... what did you have?
I am not telling. (collects chips)
come on, show them to me. (reaches for her cards, rachel covers them up)
no..!
show them to me!
get your hands out of there! no!
let me see! show them!
y'know, I have had dates like this.
(deals new hand) boy, you really can not stand to lose, can you? your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
plus that shirt does not really match those pants.
first of all, I am not losing...
oh, you are losing. definitely losing. (phone rings)
let us not talk about losing. just deal the...
(answering phone) hel-lo, rachel green.
(mimicking rachel) mee mee, mee-mee mee.
(on phone) excuse me. (covers up phone; to ross) it is about the job.
barbara! hi, how are you? (listens) uh-huh. (listens) no, i understand. yeah. oh, oh, come on, no, I am fine. do not be silly. yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea—hello? hello? (hangs up phone, very depressed)
sorry, rach.
y'know, there is going to be lots of other stuff.
yeah...(sigh)....ok. where were we? oh, ok... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante.
look, rachel, we do not have to do this.
yes, we do. (pause)
alright, check.
check.
I am in for fifty cents. (throws it in)
call.
I am in.
i see your fifty cents... and i raise you... five dollars. (throws it in)
i thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
well, i just lost a job, and I would like to raise the bet five bucks. does anybody have a problem with that?
(to ross): loser?
no, i fold. (lays cards down, and gets up)
what do you mean, you fold? hey, come on! what is this? i thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I am not a nice guy.' i mean, what, were you just full of it?
I am in. (throws in chips)
how many you want?
one. (rachel gives him the card.)
dealer takes two. (she deals herself two cards) what do you bet?
i bet two dollars. (throws it in)
ok... see your two... and i raise you twenty. (throws it in)
i see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. (throws it in)
see your twenty-five...and...uh, monica, get my purse.
rachel, there is nothing in it.
ok, then get me your purse.
ok, here you go. good luck.
(to monica): thank you. (to ross): i saw your twenty-five, and i raise you... seven.
...teen! (throws in a ten-dollar bill)
(to joey): joey, I am a little shy.
that is ok, ross, you can ask me. what?
(to ross): what do you need, what do you need?
fifteen.
alright, here is ten. (gives it to him)
here, i got five, i got five. (ross takes the money)
thank you.
good luck.
(to rachel): ok, i am calling your seventeen. what do you got?
(lays down cards) full house.
you got me.
(to ross): ahhh, that is alright. y'know, that is a tough hand to beat.
(to ross): i thought we had them!
oh, well, when you do not have the cards, you do not have the cards, you know. (looks at rachel) but, uh... look how happy she is. (smiles)
airplane! airport! airport '75! airport '77! airport '79!
oh, time's up.
(pointing at the drawing, upset) bye... bye... birdie.
oh!
that is a bird?
that is a bird!
ok, ok, it is my turn. (reads the answer)
go.
uh.... bean! bean!
(triumphantly) the unbearable likeness of being!
yes!
that, you get? that, you get?
hey hon, could you help me get the plates down?
yeah. hey, here is an idea, why do not we use our wedding china today?
no, i think we should save our china for something really special. like if the queen of england comes over.
honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
what if something gets broken, they are so expensive.
what is the point of having them if we never use them?
ok, but if something gets broken, and then the queen comes over..
i will explain it to her.
<laughs> oh yeah, like I am going to let you talk to the queen.
wow, the parade is really good this year. man those horses can crap.
muskogee! that is like four hours from tulsa. woo hoo!
oh my god!
are not you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap days of our lives?
yeah! i totally forgot I am supposed to be there. i can not believe i forgot. i usually write stuff like this on my arm.
what are you going to do?
i guess I am going to have to come up with a really good reason why i was not there. the producers are going to be so mad at me. they sat us all down yesterday and said "everyone has to be there at 6:00 am sharp, that means you tribbiani." like.. like i was some kind of idiot.
well you proved them wrong.
a lot of people are thankful for those.
who is it?
hide my rings.
oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>
um... hi.
aw.
i have not seen you in like.. a year.
oh well yeah me too. um.. i had a baby.
oh.. yeah? well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.
mh hmm..
uh.... its emma.
hey amy.
oh amy, you remember ross.
that was me.
careful. <hands chandler a china plate> careful. careful!
I will tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I will be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this is not the china we picked out..
i know, after you left the store, i chose different ones.
why?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.
oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
hey, everybody. happy thanksgiving!
hey happy thanksgiving.. pheebs! <motions her to come over>
hey, what is going on joe?
i.. i.. i need a good lie.
oh okay. how about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing. you know? you. you could. you could see the strings people!
no, no, no i need a good lie to explain why i was not at a work thing today.
ooh, honey. you stink at lying.
i do not.
oh really. okay. let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffee house, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and i said "hey do not eat that-that is phoebe's" and he said.. <pause> he said.. "joey you stink at lying." what am i going to do?
do not worry, do not worry. we will come up with a good lie. I will help you practice it.
oh great, that would be great. thank you.
sure, what.. what was the work thing?
uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows phoebe, she looks>
"pick up grandma at the airport"?
oh.. man..
amy! <pause> yes i do.. i really do. <grabs ross' hand for support>
sure, we do not live there but...
yeah, no. ross has a phd.
god she is unbelievable.
i know, i mean a phd is just as good as an md.
oh sure ross, yeah. if i have a heart attack in a restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush.
what? what happened?
do not say that.
oh amy, do not cry amy.  um.. ross, could i talk to you in private?
sure, you want to go upstairs?
um look i was thinking.. if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving.
you know, i think that is a great idea. it will be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis.
look i know she is a little tough to take. she has no where else to go, and she is my sister. alright, she is emma's aunt. and i would like them to bond.
ok, fine, but i do not want them bonding to much. i do not want her telling emma she needs a nose job.
ross, you know what? she may need one..we are just going to have to make our peace with that!
hey you guys, this is my sister amy.  this is chandler, joey, phoebe and you know mon.
pheebs, i still need some help here
oh right, ok um. ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . for example if you look down at the ground when you are talking, people know you are lying.
oh.. i do not know why this is so hard for me. you know.. i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor.
oh we just put her down for a nap.
that is a great movie. <she claps>
emma.
phoe-be.
honey, i do not know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to ross or to myself <ross and rachel knock on wood> um you would not get the baby.
well we have not offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler.
i can not believe you would want us to raise emma.
yeah oh my god, I am so moved.
see look amy, we are a lot closer to monica and chandler. we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you do not seem very connected to the baby.
you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know I have had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>
okay! it is time for dinner. everyone we are using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches ross' arm>
hey! how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
no, honey, its. that is a special plate.  see its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.
i can not believe i won.
monica is ross' sister.
that was me.
hey. amy. you have got to stop doing that.
now see, this way you protect the plate.. and let us face it you have fun.
no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right?
well actually...
actually what?
well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma would go to my parents.
what?
so if monica's not around, then I am not good enough to raise emma?
yeah he is lying. he looked down.
well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
honey, you are taking this the wrong way. we think you are going to be a wonderful parent. it is just.. you are more the fun parent.
yeah and we would want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
that is not how you see me, is it?
look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I am not capable?
no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you are strongest when.. when you are together.
ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table>  she would have to give her up.
sure, monica would have to give her up.
i lie better then that, right?
so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
there is your movie! <claps>
hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner.
oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?
ross and rachel do not know what they are talking about. i mean its not like their so responsible. emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom.
yeah but they are right. i mean, I am not a strong father figure and i never will be.
no you learn these things. you grow into it.
yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it.
i do not know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you are going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "go to your room! you are grounded"?
can you hear me say "you are grounded"?
you said that to me last week.
how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture.
it is ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it is easy to remember and does not invite a lot of questions. you were not at the parade because you had a family emergency.
oh, i like that, yeah. was not at the parade because i had a family emergency.
ooh, what happened?
no! nothing with a raccoon.
arg... alright, I will take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>
oh wait.. what are you doing?
setting the table.
yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
oh how nice. maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
hey dude, you okay? sorry about before.
oh no that is okay, you are totally right. i do not know anything about disciplining a child. but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die, you do not get joey.
uchh! <much louder and longer then amy's>
yeah.. yeah right.. remember in high school when i died and did not give you my baby?
what? what carrer?
ok. you decorate dad's office and so now you are a decorator. okay! i went to the zoo yesterday and now I am a koala bear.
sup.. you want to talk supportive? you did not even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby.
i did the first time! oh. oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> and you know what. you want to know why I am not giving emily to you.
emma.
ooh oooh..
uh huh.
jealous of what? of your lack of responsiblity? you, your immaturity? your total disregard of other people's feelings?
timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
i cannot, i cannot believe that i invited you here today.
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> it is forty five.
you take that back.
take it back!
heey man, i work out.
i do pilates.
bring it on!
put the plates in the boxes!! put the plates in the boxes!
did you just push me?
alright. that is it! <pushes amy back>
oh my god! should not we stop this?
what? are you out of your mind? let us throw some jello on them.
ew! gross.
alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can not act your age then you should not be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they are very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now.
mon, I am so sorry.
okay. that is better. now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
by the way, that fight was totally arousing.
dude. well done. you know what? if i die, and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma.
oh yeah? well thanks.
so, so now do i get joey?
okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
are you okay mon?
uh huh.. i mean these things happen. its' just a plate. its not like somebody died.
it is all right. you can mourn.
actually its not pies, its just pie.
i do not care. <pauses and realizes...> oh my god. I have lost the will to scold.
look amy, it got a little of control..um.. and I am sorry. you are my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
uh. no.. i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount.
she needs changing.
oh no no no.. I will get her. I am super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. I will be right there emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> well.. what do you know? i guess, I will be the one who dies first.
hey, does monica know about her broken plates yet?
nope...
broke them all, huh?
yep...
you going to tell her?
nope... (monica walks in) hey... so I am going to... put the plates back. you know, i think you were right, i do not think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
like only if the queen comes?
maybe not even then. (joey walks in)
hey! i did it. i called my producer. i told him i had a family emergency, he totally bought it. thanks for teaching me how to lie pheebs.
no problem! next week: stealing... (chandler walks away to store the box of broken china.)
bye plates!
oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (chandler walks back, looking angrily at joey)
what? something happened with the plates?
uhm... (looks down) yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
(on phone) okay, great!  bye. (hangs up as chandler enters.) so guess who is coming to thanksgiving dinner?
sydney portier? hehheh.
(not amused by chandler’s joke) i miss rachel. (to chandler) no, my parents.
oh! that is great, they have not seen the place since i moved in!
yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (quickly trying to change subjects), i was thinking we would eat around four.
(shocked at the news) why can not i tell them that we live together?
because they do not know we are dating. (again, trying to quickly change subjects.) do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)
why have not you told them?!
um, well, i was going to, i-i-i really was. but um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, i did not.
why have not you told them?! would not they be happy?!
(trying to change subjects, excitedly) so! dinner in the kitchen around four! I will see you then. (pats chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)
why would not they be happy?
well, um, because mainly, um, they do not like you. I am sorry.
what? what? why?!
maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you are really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
is this why they do not like me or why you do not like me?
look, i know that i should have told them. i know i should not care what they think. I am sorry.
y’know, it will be okay. it will be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then we will tell ‘them.
you really think that will work?
hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, did not i?
(hugging chandler) i do not think you will ever get my parents that drunk!
hey! (sees ross is there) oh, good, ross! you are parents like me, right?
(only half-paying attention) yes, of course they like you!
well monica just told me that they do not.
(not paying attention) yeah, they do not like you.
(annoyed) do you know why?
i dunno, maybe it is because you are really sarcastic. or maybe it is because you uh-
(angry) well if people do not know they should not just guess!
this is great, another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?
maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment.
well maybe i love ya’.
[mocks that last comment].
hey.
(trying to act manly in front of janine) no i do not want to play video games, joey!
yeah! yeah, why? what is up?
for real?
ye-ye, we go to yours!
yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it is my sister. but, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
how you got three women to marry you, I will never know.
hey!
hey! hey, pheebs, check it out. yeah, for my desert, i have chosen to make a traditional english truffle!
wow, that sounds great! and what are you making monica, in case rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that i eat all of it. there is none left for anybody else!
nothing.
(worried) nothing?
no, sweetie, i-i trust you.
so, if-if i mess this up, there is nothing else for dessert?
you are not going to mess it up.
wow, monica, i love that, you really have faith in me. thank you. technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?
well, it is done about two minutes before it looks like that.
oh, ooh the food smells great, mon!
and the place looks so nice!
yeah, hey hey, happy thanksgiving everybody!
happy thanksgiving!
well, this has been great!
see ya!
whoa whoa whoa! where are you going?
oh, oh, we did say we would stop by this little thing joey’s roommate is having.
oh, janine, the really hot dancer girl?
some would say she is attractive, yes.
and who else is going to be there?
uh, some of her friends, yeah.
her dancer friends?
(frustrated) yes, all right? all of her hot dancer friends are going to be there and they are going to be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really want to go!
(to joey) dude, we were good!
you are not going to go anywhere, you said you were going to eat here, and you are going to eat here!
yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very thanksgivingy.
oh, but-but it is, uh, it is just like the first thanksgiving, when the indians and the pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
yeah, yeah, and the indians taught the pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
dad [kisses jack], mom [kisses judy]. look! look who it is it is chandler!
mr. and mrs. geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
whoa, snowing out there?
dad, chandler was just laughing at your joke.
rach, rach, i just remembered. i had a dream about mr. geller last night.
really?!
yeah, i dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! and it is making me look at him totally differently. y’know, i mean he used to be just, y’know “jack geller monica and ross’s dad” and now he is he is “jack geller, dream hunk."
i dunno. y’know to me he will always be “jack geller, walks in while you are changing.”
y’know dad, chandler is one of ross’s very best friends!
yeah, ross sure is a great guy, y’know I have always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
(worried) he is the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
rach, you are killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? those drunken dancers are waiting!
(looking at her truffle) look at it, is not it beautiful?
yeah, yeah, what is it?
it is a truffle. it is got all of these layers. first there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch, [joey and ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [joey and ross look like something is wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!
w-what was the one right before bananas?
the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, y’know, i thought “well, there is mincemeat pie,” i mean that is an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [to joey] oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place?
y-sure!
(teasingly) and while I am gone do not you boys sneak a taste.
beef in a dessert?! i- no no no, there is no way!
i know, and only one layer of jam?! what is up with that?
oh my god, the pages are stuck together!
(turning to chandler in a scolding tone) chandler!
oh my god, she-she made half a english trifle, and half a...sheperd’s pie!
(sad) oh man! now she is going to start all over! we are never going to get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
no, no, we will. we just will not tell her she messed up.
just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
yeah, it will be like a funny thanksgiving story!
(shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) vomiting stories are funny...
joey, god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
did-did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?
no!
(frustrated) still not hot enough!
rachel?
yeah?
okay, look at him. look at those strong hands. oh what i would not give to be that can of (looks closer to see what jack is drinking) condensed milk.
mom, uh, chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
oh, yes. well it is very beautiful. it is cream-colored and tight [realizes what he just said and looks worried. monica and ross also looked shocked. judy and jack give chandler a very dirty look.] i do not mean tight, i mean it is not too tight, not that i was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
(shocked) what?
(shocked) what?
(worried) dude, i need to talk to you a sec.
okay, i think i might know why my parents do not like you.
you do? why?
okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
what?! why did you do that?
i do not know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I am I am sorry. i-i did not think it would matter.
how could it not matter?!
how was i supposed to know we would end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
what about all that “friends forever” stuff?
i do not know, i-i was all high.
mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to chandler) were trying to get ross stoned!
your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
ross, i can not believe you would do that!
the reason we have not told them we are together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?
okay, okay, I will tell ‘them it was not chandler who got high. now who should i say it was?
you! it is not like it is a big deal! you-you do not still do it or anything!
alright, alright, now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it?
dad, please do not pick your teeth out here! alright, and if you are going to put your feet up, why do not you sit on the-
monica, leave him alone!
(to rachel) will you hurry up? did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janine’s friends are dancers?! and that they are going to be drinking alot!?
(sarcastically) no, i did, but tell me again, because it is so romantic.
well you are whippin’ so slow! can not you do it any faster?
joey! come on! i do not want to make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's going to be like “oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle?”
so why do not you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
oh i am!
ross, if you do not tell them, then i will!
okay, fine!
ross! can i talk to you for a second?
oh, uh, can it wait a second joey? i have to tell my parents something. no it can not? okay.
okay, look, i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert.
what?! what is with everybody? it is thanksgiving, not...truth-day!
look, when everyone eats that...that...banana-meat thing, they are all going to’ make fun of her, do you want that?
okay, okay, we will just get everyone to act like they like it. that-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie! (referring to the dancers.)
(scolding) dude, they are not objects.
just kiddin,’ I will talk to them, you distract rach.
hey rach, can i talk to you outside for a second?
okay...
what is up, ross?
so um...thanksgiving. the holiday season is upon us, hm?
yeah!
and um...you look nice today.
oh no. no ross, do not do this.
what?
i just- i do not think us getting back together is a good idea.
(shocked) eh?
i thought this might happen today. ross, i know the holidays can be rough. y’know? and it is probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
(cutting her off) you are alone.
no, i-i live with phoebe. i mean you are [pity-tone] alone, alone. and i just-it is just not the time for us. I am sorry.
(just trying to get out of the conversation) ah well, can not blame a guy for trying!
oh and (ross begins to open the door and joey says some gibberish word to indicate to ross that he is not done yet. ross closes the door again.) okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, i learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! and smiling (smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?
yeah, I am not going to pay for those acting classes anymore.
rachel, there you are! come on, let us serve that dessert already!
joey, you are going to have to stop rushing me, you know what? you do not get any dessert.
(happily) really?
no, I am just kidding i would never do that to you! okay, everybody, it is trifle time!
so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, is not it?
it sure is.
wow. so then did you make it with beef or eggplant?
beef.
i can not have any. you know i do not eat meat. (faking dissapointment.) ohhh no.
alright, monica, i want you to have the first taste.
really?
oh oh oh, wait! you only got whipped cream in there! ya got to take a bite with all the layers!
okay.
op! wait, you dropped a pea.
well?
(faking joy. rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like joey said) mmmm! it is good!
really? how good?
it is so good, that i feel really selfish about being the only one who is eating it, that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is. especially ross.
(clearly lying and hating the dessert) yeah, this is so good, that I am going to go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert.
(again, lying) I am going to go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror, as i eat it.
okay, now what was that all about? is it-does it not taste good? let me try it.
wha? no no! ah! (ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. he looks like he is going to throw up.) (lying) all gone! so good! maybe chandler has some left.
it tastes like feet!
i like it.
are you kidding?
what is not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? gooooood.
...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
(lying) yes, but if it is any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
rachel, come here. (rachel walks over to phoebe. chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack.
oh, phoebe, do i want to hear this?
i dunno, let us see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were going to get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl.
(humoring phoebe) oh my god, he dream-cheated on you!
yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not going to happen.
five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman.
ross? let us go.
oh yeah, about telling mom and dad, i was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
alright, you know what? that is it. you have had your chance.
wha-what?
(out loud, to her parents) mom! dad! ross smoked pot in college!
(in a 5 year old’s tone) (to monica) you are such a tattletale! mom, dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I am sorry.
and dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? he did not steal your playboys! ross did!
yeah, well, hurricane gloria did not break the porch swing, monica did!
ross has not worked at the museum for a year!
monica and chandler are living together!
ross married rachel in vegas! and got divorced! again!!!!
(joining in) i love jacques cousteau!
(reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) i was not supposed to put beef in the trifle!
(pounding the table) i want to gooooooo!
i-i uh, i got tricked into all those things!
thank you!
(in a parent-like tone) I will talk to them!
you guys! it was bananas, cream, and beef! i-i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i would not feel bad!
well actually, i-i did not eat mine. it is still in the bathroom.
no it is not, i ate that.
nope, got it and i got yours (pointing to jack) too.
oh, ross, mon, is it okay if i bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?
yeah.
sure. yeah.
so, who is the guy?
well, his name is parker and i met him at the drycleaners.
oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (sits up) who said that?
yeah, he is really great though. he has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl i am.
(to ross) oh, by the way. would it be okay if i gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
yeah, I would really like to.
okay, hopefully this time mom will not boo you.
yes! every year ross makes the toast, and it is always really moving, and always makes them cry. well this year I am going to make them cry.
and you wonder why ross is their favorite?
no! really! any time ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "god, your brother." know what they will say this year? "god, you"
well i can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (points to himself) I am an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)
really you can do that?
are you kidding me? watch! (makes funny faces trying to cry) well i can not do it with you guys watching me!
what are you doing?
oh I am working on my toast for the party, or as i like to call it. sob fest 2002. hey check this out. (hands him a picture.)
it is a dog.
it is a dead dog. that is chi-chi; she died when i was in high school.
it is your parents’ anniversary and you are going to talk about their dead pet?
the good stuff, huh?
hi!
hey!
hey!
you got a present for my parents. that is so sweet.
yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, i had a star named after them.
aww that is so cool.
and i got them a book on karma sutra for the elderly.
hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
yeah, sure. what do you need? we got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (pause) and i think my testacles may be in here too.
(picking up chi-chi’s picture) aww! chi-chi! oh, i loved this dog! y’know monica could not get braces because chi-chi needed knee surgery.
what?!
you were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
hey!
everybody, this is parker, parker this is…
ha!
ah, actually, I am sorry we-we probably should get going.
i, uh, think you already are.
that is my old dog. he passed away years ago.
it is out on the island. it is in massapequa.
well, there is an arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
okay, i got my note cards. (to chandler) do you got the presents?
yeah.
and I have got the car keys.
yeah.
so uh, he seems like a nice guy.
yeah, yeah i like him a lot.
ya want to hang back and take our own cab?
yeah, otherwise I am not going.
hi! (kisses his mom.) hey mom.
this is such a great party! 35 years. very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
that is a good question, dad. that is a good question…
hmmm….
thank you…we are so excited
wha—what?
dad so what we have to pretend that we are married?
can you believe that?
yeah, if you are going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
no, us having to lie about being married.
no, i know i do not either, but ya know what, it is their party, and it is just one night. and we do not even have to lie; we just will not say anything. if it comes up again, we will just…smile. we will nod along.
hi aunt lisa, uncle dan
oh…
(looking at the check) unbelievable!
we love marriage!
hey
hey!
i do not think the flash went off.
I will go with you
somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
i have to go to the bathroom too, but i do not want him complimenting my thing.
I am so we were not in the car! did he ever let up?
he called the long island expressway a concrete miracle.
(imitating parker) this room! this night! that waiter! his shoes! i must take a mental picture! (he backs into someone.) ooh sorry…(he looks behind him then notices its phoebe then stops his impression.)
were you guys making fun of parker?
that depends, how much did you hear?
so, he a little enthusiastic, what is wrong with that?
it is just that, it is so much.
well, so what i like him! do i make fun of the people you have dated? tag, janice, mona? no, because friends do not do that. but, do you want my opinion? do you want it? ‘because in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who is who of human crap. (walks off)
i feel terrible.
i know
what was wrong with mona?
open it! open it! open it!
yeah baby!
no, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. it was a small wedding.
but it was beautiful. i mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
on a cliff, in barbados, at sunset, and stevie wonder sang is not she lovely as i walked down the aisle.
yeah, stevie’s an old family friend. (hits ross’s chest)
so would i. you would not think that annie liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
would you excuse us for a second? (pulls rachel off to the side) umm…. what are you doing?
what? I am not you. this may be the only wedding i ever have. i want it to be amazing.
okay, okay. ooooh, ooh maybe i rode in on a harley.
okay, ross, it has to be realistic.
no, I am fine. I am great. I am with you.
hm huh, yeah.
no, that is not necessary.
no, actually i do not eat…
okay, fine! fine! (takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while dropping it on the floor) mmm…hmmmmm….
why do not you just try one?
what are you doing?
just going over my toast. those two will never know what hit ‘them. i can not wait. they are going to be crying so hard. they are going to be fighting for breath.
ya know if you want to, i can just hold them down and you could (punches the air).
and my veil was lace, made by blind, belgium nuns.
well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
well, i do not know about that, but some said that i looked like a floating angel.
oh yeah. that is a great story.
well, um, actually, i-i took her to the planetarium. that is-that is where we had our first date. um, she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…
shhh! i want to hear the rest!
then, fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "will you marry me?"
and the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!
yeah uh, phoebe! look umm, i want to apologize about before, okay? we were being jerks. parker’s a nice guy and I would like to get to know him.
then you better do it now.
why?
because I am going to kill him
what-what?
you guys were right. he is just too excited about…everything. i mean I am all for living life, but this is the geller’s 35th anniversary. okay? let us call a spade a spade this party stinks.
i know I am having the worst time. there was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when i finally got up to the plates, i slipped on a giant booger!
are you sure it was not an oyster?
i guess it could have been, i did not really look at it. y’know, i just wiped it on chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.
he is just such a great guy I am so excited about him.
oh hey, you should be excited about him. there is nothing wrong with him he is a good guy.
you think?
yeah. ya know what i think; i think we were all just being too negative.
you are right. you are right, he is just embracing life. we could all stand to be a little more like parker. you know what? i am like him! I am a sunny, positive person.
actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
what is that now?
nothing…
oh look it is parker!
oooh i love it!
are you kidding? people acting like animals to music. come on!
okay it is time for the toast! umm now-now, i know that ross usually gives the toast, but this year I am going to do it.
no, no it is going to be great. really! mom, dad, when i got married, one of the things that made me sure i could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. for that and so many other things i want to say thank you. i know i probably do not say it enough, but i love you. (pretends to cry hoping her parents will join her.) when i look around this room, I am-I am saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can not because she is dead. as is our dog chi-chi. i mean look how cute she is. (holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). was. (to an old man by the stage.) do me a favor and pass this to my parents. remember she is dead. okay, her and nana, gone. wow! hey does anybody remember when debra winger had to say goodbye to her children in terms of endearment? (chandler covers his ears) did not see that? no movie fans?! you want to hear something sad? the other day i was watching 60 minutes these orphans in romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (waits for people to cry, but does not get any tears.) you people are made of stone! here is to mom and dad! whatever!
oh, no, mom, it is just monica this year.
no, of course, um… um, everybody? um, i-i just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, rachel (she turns around and smiles), and myself. umm, that if…if in 35 years, we are half as happy as you guys are, we will count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
can i get you something to drink? like a water and valium?
oh thank god.
yeah? i know! i know! uh huh? listen why do not we just um, sit and relax? you know just be with each other. quietly!
let us try something else, let us play a game.
shocking! let us play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. (giggles)
but, let us play this one first. and remember whoever talks first loses!
oh my god! oh my god!
wrong? really? you know the word wrong. everything is not perfect? everything is not magical? everything is not a glow with the light of a million fairies? they were just brake lights, parker!
you do not have to put a good spin on everything.
no! i am a positive person. you are like santa clause on prozac, at disneyland, getting laid!
much less happy!
so long! do not let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! (he exits and she slams the door behind him.)
uh huh. (closes door)
…and then, we could have gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
ross, it just would not have been feasible.
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would have been no problem?
it was really fun being married to you tonight.
yeah! and! and, it was the easiest 400 bucks I have ever made.
okay ross, can i uh, can i ask you something?
yeah.
that proposal, at the planetarium…
i know, i know it was stupid.
are you kidding?! with the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! it was…really wonderful! did you just make that up?
no, actually i thought about it when, when we were going out. it is how i imagined i uh, i would ask you to marry me.
well, that would have been very hard to say no too.
it is a good thing i did not do it, because it sounds like it would have been a very expensive wedding. (rachel laughs) okay, good night
goodnight
even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair would not get messed up?
i will think about it.
that is all I am askin’
okay that is it. i give up. at mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you are the one giving the speech.
y’know i do not understand why they did not cry. it was a beautiful speech.
oh, come on.
hey! all that stuff you said about true love, you were right, i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad! and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin. and what you said about nana. ohh, yeah she really would have wanted to be there. and you know what? i think she was.
(starts to cry) oh good god, ross! how the hell do you do it?
you sure?
okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (does so.)
no-no, one daddy, two mommies. all right, it is all yours. (ross pushes him off.)
okay. okay.
yes! yes! yes!! (everyone stands and claps.)
his first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!
oh yeah, i remember mine! ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, i got it, and…it bent.
yeah.
i never had a bike of my own.
(shocked) what?!
well, we did not have a lot of money. but the girl across the street had the best bike! it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
that sounds like my first bike. (they all turn and look at him.) my dad gave me his old one.
ohh.
did the girl ever let you ride it?
no! but she gave me the box that it came in. it had a picture of the bike on the front. (they are all speechless) so i would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
that is so unfair!
not really, i got to drag him around too! (they all nod, "oh.")
hey! what are you guys doing?
hey.
making holiday candy for the neighbors.
I am sorry, who?
I am going to hang this basket (points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
but we do not know the neighbors.
i do. there is uh, let us see, guy with a mustache, smokes-a-lot lady, some kids I have seen, and a red-haired guy who does not like to be called rusty.
see? this is exactly why I am making this candy. we can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
would not it be easier if we just moved?
(entering, happily) gooood morning!!
eh, somebody is in a good mood!
well, why should not i be? i have great friends! i have a wonderful job!
where you can make out with your assistant.
come on, it is not a big deal! we stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
oh yeah, what is the plan?
(pauses as she thinks and exhales loudly) we… we are not… …going to let it… be a problem.
wow! it took you all night to come up with that plan?!
well y’know, we did other stuff too. (joey and chandler start to giggle.)
did you two…
oh monica come on, y’know i do not sleep with guys on the first date!
matt guire, mark lynn, ben wire…
anymore!!
okay.
hi. tag, i have a conference call today is that correct?
okay, thank you. that will be all. (the mail guy leaves and tag starts to follow, but rachel stops him.) (excitedly) wait! wait! (rushes over and closes the office-door.) did you see that? that mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. (they kiss.)
okay, you hard worker! I will remember to put that in your evaluation.
well, you have been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. but y’know, there is one thing that i have yet to evaluate. (she turns around and sweeps the stuff off of her desk and hops up onto it.)
no, I have just always wanted to do that. can you help me clean this up?
the basket is totally empty! my god, the neighbors ate all the candy!
well, either that or uh…(motions towards joey’s door.)
joey!!
yeah?
did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time i got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
yeah, and they have been coming by all day. they love it!
they love my candy? oh man!!! I have got to go make more!! (starts to do so.)
hey mon, you might want to make some more lasagna too, because something might have happened to a huge chunk of it.
ross! the neighbors ate all my candy!!
mine stole my newspaper! it is like a crime wave!! (monica runs to make more candy.) pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
sure!
yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike i-i could not stop thinking about it. i mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so…
(gasps) oh my god ross!!
you like it?
i love it!!
yeah?
ohh!! ohh!! and i love you!
ahh.
not that way! but the bike brought you a lot closer!
ah! (she hugs him.) well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y’know give it a test ride.
okay! oh my god! my first bike! thank you for the best present I have ever gotten.
(stunned at the complement) you are welcome.
(starts to leave, but stops) oh and chandler’s about to cry.
(about to cry) am not!
(turning a light on) who is that?!
do not worry, I am brave! i am brave! i…i am brave! (they get to the door and monica goes to open it.) no-no-no-no!! (he stops her.) (through the door.) can you tell me who is there please?
hi. do you know what time it is?
oh please! (to chandler) did you hear that? little drops of heaven.
(laughs) 4:00 a.m.
i am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (monica looks at him) (to monica) he does not know that i am not some of us.
umm, listen i am sorry, but I will put some out first thing in the morning.
um-hmm.
mm! night gar’! (monica closes the door.)
(hugging him) so did you read your evaluation yet?
(worried) okay please, you are kidding right?! i wrote that one as a joke for you!
I am thinkin’ no.
umm, i said i thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that i like your tiney-tiny touchie.
well, it gets worse. when asked if you take initiative i wrote, "yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under problems with performance i wrote, "dear god, i hope not," and then uh, then i drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
ross! that is so sweet of you to get phoebe that bike! when i heard the story, i almost cried.
almost cried huh? hear that chandler? almost cried!
hey, you cry every time somebody talks about titanic!
(about to cry) those two only had each other!
phoebe really likes the bike huh?
oh yeah! i saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. she had uh, these flowers in the basket. it was so cute.
yeah, i saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.
wait a minute, she was walking the bike? both times?
hey pheebs?
oh hi!
hey! so are you enjoying the bike?
ohh, uh-huh so much!
pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike do not you?
of course!
umm, can we see you ride it?
okay. (the gang is giggles then phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) see?
see, this is why i told you never get involved with your assistant! and here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (to chandler) did you hear that chandler? no such thing!
(with his mouth full) what happened? I am just eating candy.
maybe it is not as bad as i think. y’know, maybe they did not take it the way i meant it.
absolutely! y’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
ugh, i just got to get the thing back!
hey rach?
yeah?
that sketch you mentioned? might it have looked a little something like this? (he shows her what he is been drawing.)
oh my god! joey!
what is the matter with you?
ugh!
boy i tell ya, this little talent came in handy before i could afford porn.
I am sorry, i can not help you. see? (points to her new sign.) rules are rules.
no kidding, out of towners huh? what did you tell ‘them?
some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
(watching the discussion) hey chandler, do we know that lady?
maybe, is not she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
(still talking to the woman) all right, I will do it just this once! but you can not tell anybody!
(closing the door) it is unbelievable! i-i can not believe that sign did not work!
y’know what would work?
hmm?
stop making candy!
but they like it!
you mean they like you.
maybe.
is that why you became a chef? so that people would like you?
oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? (joey laughs but stops when chandler turns to glare at him.)
okay, now just remember everything i taught you and you will be fine. okay? here we go. ready…set…
(hopping off the bike) wait! this seat is really uncomfortable! yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
phoebe, you can not get out of this! okay? you have to learn how to ride a bike!
why? why do i have to learn?
well…in-in case of emergency.
what kind of an emergency?
well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "you ride this bike or I will sh…I will shoot you."
okay, i would ring the bell to distract him and then i would knock the gun out of his hand with a chinese throwing star.
okay, phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—hey! I will hold you up and-and push you. okay?
you will not let go?
no!
swear?!
i swear!
(thinks it over) okay.
come on. (she gets on the bike.) all right, here we go. all right? (they start.)
all right.
all right. feel good?
well…
all right, try pedaling.
okay. (does so.)
that is it, your doing great.
okay.
doing great! yes-yes-yes! take control! yes!
weee!!! (ross pushes her and let us go.)
yes!! yes!!! (he starts clapping and phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
oh! oh! oh no!! you swore!
i-i just thought you were doing so well. i…
i am shocked! shocked!! (she storms off leaving ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
it is a legitimate learning technique. (looking around and seeing the woman behind him glaring at him.) wow!
hey, there is uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.
well, they are just going to have to wait are not they? I have only got two hands!!
need some help?
no! you do not know the system! there will be nobody messing with the system!
by the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. (she glares at him and he quickly makes his way to phoebe’s room.)
(seeing him) oh, hello liar.
(entering) look, i-I am really sorry i let go of the bike.
i could have been killed i hope you know!
i know. i know. but, can we please try it again? huh? i mean, you were so close phoebe!
well, i would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. (ross just happens to have his hand on a sheet that is covering something that suspiciously looks like a bike.)
phoebe.
what?! (ross rings the bell.) what the hell?!
all right, y’know what? if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I am sorry, I am just going to have to take it back.
what?! why?!
because! because, it-it-it is… it would be like you having this guitar (points to hers) and-and never playing it. okay, this guitar wants to be played! and-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you do not ride it you-you are-you are killing its spirit! (pause) the bike is dying.
all right. if you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
great! great! (he runs to the door.) you are making the bike very happy.
(sarcastically) okay ross! (ross exits and she says quietly to the bike) please do not die!
okay, i think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we are going to have to get into mr. zelner’s office. now, he does not get in until 10, so he is no problem, but his assistant, betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
yeah, well betty’s kind of sad. which is why i believe i can lure her away with these chocolates. (holding up the box of chocolates.) now, while i distract her, you get in the office.
let us roll!
(worried and shocked) yeah, sure mr. zelner, for you anything—minute. okay. fine. (to tag) abort the plan, abort the plan. (she start to usher tag out.)
okay. uh, well can we, can we get you anything mr. zelner? maybe some chocolates? (holds up the box.)
(laughs) oh my god. can you imagine if there was?! i mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.
well…
oh no-no-no…
you are lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what? (grabs the evaluation and throws it out.) it does not matter.
whoa! i can not believe you did that. that was really sweet.
no, you could have lost your job.
thank you! you are great! (they kiss.)
what?
i… it just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
(looking at his butt) there it is. (they hug.)
(asking a man leaning against the wall) what is going on?
yeah lady! give us candy!!
joey!
what is up buddy?
what are you doing?
waiting for candy.
get in here! (they head for the door and chandler sees smokes-a-lot lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) hey, and you can not smoke in here! (takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (exhaling in ecstasy) merry christmas.
(opening the door and frantically) okay, guys! the candy is coming; i just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
all right everybody! just be quiet! be quiet! be quiet!! pipe-pipe-pipe down! (they settle down) what is the matter with you people?! this woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. she was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I will bet that not one of you can tell me her name! am i right?
no not (imitating) candy lady.
(stepping in and knocking the man over) hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
all right, y’know what? forget it, all of you forget it! you have ruined it! go home! you have ruined it! you have ruined it!
that is right, it is all ruined! you guys ruined everything! you ruined it! (steps into the apartment and chandler closes the door.) (joey struts over to the candy and starts eating it.)
(to chandler) thank you.
you are welcome. (they kiss.)
did you smoke?
no! smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. eh-uh—are you okay?
I am fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. i mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
(with his mouth full) oh yeah, sorry about that. mob mentality or whatever, i do not know… (grabs the note.)
i can not believe it! i did it! i rode a bike! i never thought I would be able to do that! thank you ross.
oh hey, do not thank me, thank yourself. you are the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
do not be so corny ross, it is not an after-school special. (she rides off and the camera pans down to reveal two shiny, silver training wheels firmly attached.)
morning!
hi! oh, how was your date last night?
pretty good.
oh good. (she walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) ahhh! my god, sorry! (she closes the door and confronts joey.)
okay, really good. anyway i got to go; I am late for work.
what-what?! you are going to leave this person with me?!
yeah—hey, do not worry, she is a terrific girl. and hey listen, could you do me a favor? when she comes out could you just mention that I am not looking for a serious relationship; that would be great.
why?! what?! are you kidding?!
just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. tell her uh, I am a loner—no! an outlaw! tell her she does not want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
y’know what? that is a lot to remember, can not i just tell her you are a pig?
hey, I am going to call her later! honest! oh come on, chandler used to do it! he would even make the girl pancakes! plus, he would make extras and leave ‘them for me.
well forget it, I am not telling that girl anything. that is not my responsibility.
fine! (pause) now, where did we land on those pancakes? (she chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)
hi.
yeah, joey kind of disabled it when i moved in.
hi.
(pause) would you like some pancakes?
…come on! why are we here?!
okay, okay take a guess.
the hot chicks?
okay, okay, i was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and i typed mine in and guess what came up? my doctoral dissertation! it is here! yeah, it is right-it is right down here! in the biggest library in the university! (they start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)
wow that is actually pretty cool.
(stopping quickly) oh umm, there is also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina. (they both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) what is that?
sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system.
you did not bring me here to do that, did you?
she sent the chicken back again?!
well fine! i want to meet this chicken expert! send the colonel in!
(to the lobster) lucky bastard! (throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planet’s most annoying woman, next to dr. laura and kathy lee gifford of course. she is the most annoying female tv character however.) janice.
I am fine.
oh… uh…
oh…my…gawd! i am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? you did not tell her we were getting married, did you?
well, she saw the ring.
did she freak out?
well, she was shocked when i told her, but then again so were most people.
right.
well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named clark. uh, she also kind of invited herself to our wedding. clark too.
(laughs) you said no right?
huh?
you said no right?!
well, she corned me! she asked if the wedding was in town! i mean, what was i supposed to do?!
lie!!! how hard is that?! the check’s in the mail! oh your baby is so cute! i can not wait to read your book ross!!
come on! so she comes to the wedding! i mean it will not be so bad.
what do you think she is just going to sit there quietly? you do not think she is going to want to make a toast? you do not think she is going to want to grab the microphone and sing part-time lover?!
oh my god, she is not going to like the chicken that night either is she?!
y’know what? it is going to be okay. y’know what? she is probably not going to even want to come.
really?
no! that was a lie! see how easy that was?
so-so you would have just lied?
yes!!
would it really have been that easy?
yes!!!
good, so do it saturday night because we are going to dinner with her and clark.
hey! what is up?
hey-hey, who is your friend? (erin turns around to face joey, startling him) hey!!
erin! still here!
yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
why would not ya? erin is great! then-then there is you guys.
i know!
okay!
yeah. I will uh, I will call ya.
oh and I will call ya too!
and call me!
(to erin) okay, good to see you again.
bye-bye.
bye!
so, system kind of broke down huh?!
oh joey, I am sorry i just could not tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. and y’know we got to talking and i…
we want you to marry her!
what?!!
she is so amazing! you have no idea.
no idea? who do you think brought her here?
cupid.
joey, she is so cool. she speaks four languages.
man, do you know what guys want!
look joey, come on she is so perfect for you! i mean she is sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
my beers?! look you guys, she is a very nice girl. okay? we had a good time, but i just—i do not see it going anywhere.
yeah, but you always say that.
yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
look I am sorry you guys, i-i just do not think so.
whatever.
fine. (they start to walk away.)
hey, do not start judging me! (to rachel) huh? you are the one who is in love with her assistant! (to phoebe) huh? and you, you are the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
phoebe!
secret affair!
people are doing it in front of my book!
I am sorry?
my doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, i went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the paleontology section!
oh my god! did you get to see anything good?
let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
yeah, there was. it was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—yes, there was.
great! because people kept showing up, i think it is like uh-a thing!
now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
oh for cryin’ out loud! (he storms out.)
all right, so we should go catch our movie.
well now what is the rush?
i like to see the previews. (rachel looks at him.) the candy.
(entering with erin) oh. hey!
well look who is here!
hey!
erin.
hi! well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. oh no!
oh phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
oh no.
(skeptical) what party?
who is birthday party?
(still skeptical) oh, and how is allison?
(does a retching sound) wait a minute! why do not you guys do something?!
(still skeptical) yeah, look how that worked out.
excuse me. hi, I am a professor here. do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
no! no!! no! can i speak to someone in charge please?! (the librarian brings his boss over.)
hi, i was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the paleontology section? see i-i wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
well, fine. fine! if-if I am the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I will go up there and defend it myself! (starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) and do not you follow me!
hey.
hey!
how did it go with erin?
oh, unbelievable! we had the best time!
yay!! oh so, you are not, you are not mad at us anymore?
no! no! no! you guys were totally right! this is so much better than the first time we went out. y’know? that was so awkward, we were really nervous.
did not you sleep together?
yeah that really calms me down. and! we have so much in common! she loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that is a…
(gasps) oh my god! listen to you talkin’ about having kids. oh my joey. (she goes over and hugs him.) oh, please do not get married before i do.
okay.
he might still show up.
is that all?
well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. um, it is going to be a small ceremony. uh, tiny! we are not even sure why we are having it.
it is actually going to be just family.
how can you say that?! the mets have no closer!
what about game 1 of the series?
you shut up! (to phoebe and rachel) i love arguing with her. (to erin) I will be right back.
so how is it going with joey?
okay? wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? i mean tell me that you like him.
but you said that you liked him! i mean what happened?! did ya just change your mind?!
then change it back!
no spark? did not you sleep together?
ugh, tramp!
does joey have any idea?
yeah, you mean like that you are kind of a loner.
yeah, and maybe that you are a real (she says something in italian, and it does not matter what she said. it is not important so i do not need everyone who speaks italian telling me what she said.)
oh well, i guess italian is not one of the four languages you speak.
(returning) hey! you want to go?
okay. see you guys later.
yeah, see ya.
(whispers to phoebe and rachel) hey, thank you so much. (they both exit.)
wow. well, i guess it was cupid who brought her here.
no, just a regular old flying dwarf.
yes? yes?! how can i help you?
oh-oh, you are-you are fellow scholars. what exactly were you looking for, hmm? perhaps, (grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps dr. chester stock’s musings on the smiledon californicus?
ah… ah…get out of here! (the couple retreats. ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) uh, meeting someone? or-or are you just here to brush up on marion’s views on evolution?
i find marion’s views far to progressionist.
I am a professor here uh, ross…geller.
yes! you are the person who checked out my book?!
well i uh, i skipped forth grade.
i am very…very sorry.
hey!
hey!
hi!
so how was, how was your date?
oh, it was great! i mean we walked all around the village. we went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… and guess what, I am thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
oh really? she said she wants to go away with you?
no-no-no-no-no! it is a surprise, but it is going to be tricky thought because she said she was going to be pretty busy at work for a while.
jo-joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? umm, i kind of got the feeling from her today that uh, she is not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
where are you gettin’ this?
well, she told me. she said she is kind of a loner.
oh. oh.
joey…
no hey rach, it is cool okay? y’know I am a loner too! (heads for his room.) right?
hey joey, y’know what? you are way to good for her.
yeah and honey i promise next time that i will just say good-bye and tell ‘them you are not looking for a relationship.
no! no. do not do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
well that too. (joey goes into his room.) joey?
yeah?
do you want some pancakes?
(coming back out) finally!
what are we going to do?
i say we go with careless whisper.
(to monica) did she see us yet? did she see us?
janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
(to chandler) our kids are going to call her aunt janice are not they?
are not you just a tinsy bit curious?
yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
we will just…we will just let her stay.
no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
kind of like your barca lounger.
is that what you are thinking about right now?
i never stop thinking about it.
janice, I am sorry but umm, you can not stay here tonight.
honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
oh my god! oh my god! you have to go!
because chandler still has feelings for you!
say again?
that is right. that is right. and that is why you can not stay here tonight. and probably why you should not come to the wedding.
feelings, such strong feelings.
i mean, i realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
(to the guard) do not sweat it, I have got this section covered. yeah, in fact I have got this little baby (turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(the guard walks away)—okay, see you later.
i just wanted to show monica your book. (ross just glares at him.)
ohh. mmm.
(comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) hi.
hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
oh, y’know I am not that much of a sweet tooth. i—(chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)—wow. my god, so creamy. oh my god, this is the best cheesecake i have ever had. where did you get this? (she reaches over to look at the label on the box.)
(nervously) it was at the front door. when i got home. somebody sent it to us.
chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs. (gasping) thief.
i—no! i did not read the box before i opened it. and you can not return a box after you have opened the box.
why, why not?
because it is too delicious.
chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong.
no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is going to send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (reading the label) momma’s little bakery. (pause) i feel terrible, I am a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
(taking a bite) oh, I am sorry what?
all right, i should get going, big day a work. y’know I am in a coma? today, they do this test on me and it turns out I am not brain dead.
so…
ah-ah-ah mr. smartie pants, it is just not my character that is not brain dead. hey, so pheebs, we still on for tonight?
absolutely!
I will see you at 8:00.
okay. (joey exits.)
oh, what is at 8:00?
oh, i have dinner plans with joey. we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
wow, did not know that! may i say how lovely you look today?
duly noted.
thanks. (phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (to monica) oh! so for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
what are you talking about?
cousin frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.
you were invited?!
no.
my god, i can not believe this! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited, but i thought that was it! i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable!
well, maybe since the age of 9, frannie’s made some new friends.
well l-look okay, it is probably just a mistake. let me call aunt sheryl okay? maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? and if i had not have stopped her, there probably would not even be a wedding to go too.
y’know, she tried to undress me too.
i used to undress my cousin glenn. (monica looks at him then sushes him.)
joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet?!!
umm, i think he is still out. what is wrong?
well, I will tell you rachel karen green, i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note. (hands it to rachel.)
(reading the note) "pheebs, can not make it, got a date. talk to you later. big daddy." (laughs) big daddy?
oh that is a nickname we were trying out.
hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? the ross-a-tron! (monica shakes her head in disgust.)
(entering) hey!
oh! here is joseph francis!
oh-wha-ho! what are you middle naming me for?! i left you a note!
so what?! that does not give you the right to ditch me!
hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
phoebe he is right, that is the rule.
i do not accept this rule. when me make plans, i expect you to show up. okay, i can not just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this (motions that their friendship) is for life!
wow! I am so sorry; i had no idea it would bother you this much.
well, it does.
okay, can i-can i make it up to you? huh? I am sorry. (they hug.) how about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I will pay for myself!
okay, you wore me down.
hey joe, while you are over there how about another beer for the ross-a-tron?
the ross—is that back?!! (chandler motions no.)
hi!
another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again!
so just bring it back downstairs, what is the problem?
i can not seem to say goodbye.
are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
well I have forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling… (pause) wow! my whole mouth just filled with saliva!
(closing the box) y’know what? forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch! we are just light-headed! so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
yeah and we will drop it off downstairs so that we are not tempted.
good idea. where do you want to go to lunch?
momma’s little bakery, chicago, illinois. (they exit with the cheesecake.)
awww! mel torme died.
joey, that paper’s like a year old!
aw! does that mean the sam goody’s sale is over?!
(entering) hey.
hey.
hey.
so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it was not a mistake. ahh, there is-there is limited seating in the hall.
limited seating?! (screechingly) i am just one tiny person!
well yeah, but she does not know that. i mean, the last time she saw you-you would have turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
(disgusted) limited seating! oh, that is such a lame excuse! that is not the reason she is not inviting me!
oh what is the big deal?! i was not even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. and-and y’know what? if it makes you feel any better, joan and i will just make an appearance and then, and then we will-we will leave early as a sign of protest.
joan?
yeah, joan tedeski my date. she is an assistant professor in the linguistics department. tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
wait a minute, you got ross gellar and guest?! i was not invited and you got "and guest?!"
uh-uh, excuse me, i do have to interrupt on ross’s behalf. i-i think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…
(interrupting) not broad backed!
wait a minute, y’know, you are bringing me!
what? i can not cancel on joan!
why not?!
bec—did you not hear me?! she is an assistant professor in the linguistics department, okay? they are wild! why do you want to come anyway?
because! she is my cousin. i mean, we grew up together! we are family y’know? well that is important to me.
okay, all right, I will take you. I will go call joan. (does so.)
aww that is nice. family should be there, huh? this is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
(laughs) we will see.
well, thank you for lunch.
what? wait a minute, i did not pay, i thought you paid!
so apparently we just do not pay for food anymore. (rachel laughs then chandler notices something.) do you see what i see?
(gasps) its still there! (the cheesecake they returned to mrs. braverman is still lying in front of her door.)
mrs. braverman must be out. (they move closer to it.)
she could be out of town. maybe she will be gone for months.
by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we do not want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
no that could kill her.
well, we do not want that.
no so we are protecting her.
but we should take it.
but we should move quick.
why?
because i think i just heard her moving around in there.
go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! (rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
(gasps) (whispering) oh my god! that is david!
david who?
david the scientist guy, david that i was in love with, david who went to russia and broke my heart david!
oh, you say someone is name enough, they turn around.
david! (he kisses her cheek) what-what are you doing here? are not you supposed to be in russia?
well… yeah. you look great too. did you get a haircut?
yeah.
uh-huh.
well, of course i would want to see you. i…i think about you all the time.
really?
uh-huh.
yeah.
(excited) yes! oh no!
i can not. i can not believe i have plans, i can not. can you do it tomorrow night though?
phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?
uh-huh. (they go over and talk.)
what are you doing?
well, i have plans with joey tonight.
so! he will understand!
no he will not. and that is not even the point! monica, i made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! and now y’know what? just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from russia just for one night, i-i should change my beliefs?! i should change beliefs! no! no! no, if i do not have my principles, i do not have anything!
god, you are so strong.
or! i should rush through dinner with joey and i can meet david at 9:00!
(taking a bite) oh my god! that is so good!
I am full, and yet i know if i stop eating this, I will regret it.
(entering) hey!
hey!
(seeing what they are doing) what do you got there?
oh it is umm, it is tofu cake. do you want some? (he makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, chandler follows him in.)
what are you doing tonight?
huh? uh… (he starts taking off his pants.)
dude! dude! (motions that joey should pull up his pants.)
oh! (pulls up his pants.) sorry. uh, I have got those plans with phoebe, why?
oh really? uh, monica said she had a date at 9:00.
what?! tonight?!
that is what monica said.
after she gave me that big speech?! she goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? i think she is trying to pull a fast one on big daddy!
oh here, i think this is us. (reading the name cards.) yeah.
limited seating my ass. let us see who made the cut. (to the couple sitting to her right.) hi!
I am monica gellar. who do you know the bride and groom?
used to work with her. used to! I am a relative and i did not get invited! a blood relative! blood!!
(to monica) stop saying, "blood" to strangers.
(to the couple on her left) so, how about you huh? how do you know the happy couple?
okay, you are fine.
hey!
yes! i will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.
okay.
yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?
ohh, then no. maybe i should hear those specials again.
oh joey, we have heard the specials three times! okay? there is prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli. (she grabs his menu and hands it to the waiter.)
oh well, that changes everything! (grabs his menu and starts looking at it again. the waiter leaves.) y’know what pheebs?
huh?
you were right before. i mean, friends are so important.
(checking her watch) yeah, I am very wise. i know.
y’know-y’know what i really want?
what?
is to have a long, long talk. y’know? get joey out on the open road and really open him up.
yes! i will have the lobster ravioli.
god joey, this is taking forever!
what is the rush? what?
w-w—i just—it is that—i have—y’know i have-i have an appointment. and it is very important.
whoa-whoa, what is it?
well… it is a date.
a date?! no, no pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because i know you would not schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
come on joey, do not make me feel badly about this.
no, I am going to!! that is right! yeah, you made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl! like-like-like i did something terrible to you! and now pheebs, you are doing the same thing!
that—it is not the same thing! this is totally different! this is with david! remember david, the scientist guy? okay, he is very special to me.
okay, well my girl from the other night was special. she was a scientist too!
she was?
well, she graduated from high school!
okay, whatever. y’know what? i do not have time have time to convince you because he is only here for four hours, and I am going to go see him! (gets up and leaves.)
fine!
yeah!
fine!
yeah! (she exits.)
(to the waiter) what are you still doing here?! i told you, lobster ravioli!
hey!
oh, i would not miss this.
oh, you are such a gentleman. (grabs his arm.) come on! we are going to my place! (drags him off to her place.)
are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
(with a mouthful) mm-mmm. (nods no.)
i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (she tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) how can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
oh, what are you going to do?! are you going to go run tell monica?! are you going to tell joey?! no! because then you will have to tell them what we did! we are desert stealers! we are living outside the law!
y’know what? i do not trust you with this cake anymore! and i got it first, and I am takin’ it back! (grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)
what?! what?!
oh yes!
wait a minute!
oh yes!
oh no-no-no-no-no, no you do not!
oh yes! oh yes!
you think i trust you with it?! no! we are going to split it! you take half and i take half!
well that is not fair, you have already had some!
what? oh, well then y’know what? i think monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
what do we use to split it?
okay! (grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) all right, pick a half.
(examining the cake) okay well, this side looks bigger. uh… there is more crust on this side. y’know? so, maybe if i measured…
oh for god sake just pick a piece!
all right, I will pick that one. (points.)
that is also the smaller piece. (puts the piece onto a plate.) okay, there you go. enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. no sharing. no switching, and do not come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. (as she is saying that she is backing out the door, when she finishes she turns around to return to her place, stumbles and drops the cheesecake on the floor.) oh!!!!
(gloatingly and holding his piece) ohhh!
okay, you got to give me some of your piece.
oh-ho-ho-ho-no! no! no switching! no sharing, and do not come crying to me! ha-ha-ha! i may just sit here and have my cake all day! just sit here in the hallway and eat my… (rachel knocks the plate from his hand and it falls on the floor. that process leaves just the forkful chandler has, rachel starts to go after that little bit and chandler retreats into his apartment.)
oh, hey aunt millie.
yes, yes it is. it is uh… (aunt millie uses this opportunity to grab ross and kiss him on the lips. after she leaves ross quickly wipes his mouth with a napkin.) every time on the lips! why?! why on lips?!
here is frannie. hmm, will not she be happy to see me? (starts to get up and great frannie.)
now wait a minute, you be nice! all right? i did not bring you here so you can ambush her.
frannie was the one who found your playboys and showed them to mom.
that bitch! (he gets up and they go over to ambush frannie. monica taps on frannie’s shoulder.)
am i doing here? why? surprised to see me? ross brought me. how do you like that?!
(to frannie) hi frannie, congratulations.
you invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! why?! what—why would not you want me at your wedding? what could i have possibly done?! (frannie’s husband walks up.) stuart!
so it is really a question of who could you have possibly done.
are you sure? I will bet there is another flight to minsk in like…
that is really beautiful. what does it mean?
that is good. i got to admit, i thought it was something else.
you are right! you are right. do not say it.
i do too. (they kiss.)
(seeing him) okay, now’s not the time joey. all right? you can yell at me tomorrow.
no! no! no pheebs, I am not going to yell at you. i just y’know, started thinking about you and david and i…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. and i just… oh pheebs, come here. (he hugs her.) are you okay?
no I am not okay. the only guy I have ever been crazy about has gone to minsk and i may never…i may never see him again. (crying.)
hey, y’know you could always visit him.
oh right, like they are going to let me have a passport.
anything i can do? whatever you need.
well—but—now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back. (they hug again.)
i can give it a shot.
oh! yay! look! there is a piece that does not have floor on it!
stick to your side!
hey, come on now!
(pulls out a fork) all right, what are we having? (starts digging in.)
oh wait i forgot my wrap.
what? oh, okay. wait here. (goes to get it, but before he gets there aunt millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her attention.)
well…
why?! why on the lips?! (he wipes his mouth on monica’s wrap and walks off, leaving aunt millie stunned.)
chandler!!! chandler!!! (he opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; chandler and monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister! now get out here!
(to monica) wow! listen, we had a good run. what was it? four? five months? i mean, that is more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (he kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)
what are you doing?!
oh, I am going on the lamb.
come on chandler, come on, i can handle ross. (they go to the door. ross is trying to stick his hand through and undo the chain; monica pushes his hand back.) (to ross) hold on! (she opens the door.) hey ross. what is up bro?
what the hell are doing?!!
(running from the guy's apartment with joey in tow) hey, what is-what is going on?!
well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica.
(panicking) dude! he is right there!
(to chandler) i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this!
look, we are not just messing around! i love her. okay, I am in love with her.
I am so sorry that you had to find out this way. I am sorry, but it is true, i love him too.
(happily) my best friend and my sister! i cannot believe this. (he hugs them both.) (to joey and rachel) you guys probably want to get some hugs in too, huh? big news!
awww, no, it is okay, we have actually known for a while.
what? what? what?! you guys knew? (joey and rachel backup against the door.) you all knew and you did not tell me?!!
well, ross, we were worried about you. we did not know how you were going to react.
(happily again) you were worried about me? you did not know how i was going to react? (he hugs them both.)
okay, all right, whew! what do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? (ross turns and glares at him.) hey-hey-hey, i-i-I am just talking here, he-he is the one doing your sister.
hey, you know what i just realized? if you guys ever have kids…
(interrupting) whoa-whoa-whoa! we are having kids?!
(quickly) i call godfather!
you can not just call godfather. do not you think her brother should be godfather?
sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
guys, you are a few steps ahead of us.
yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
oh! oh, i just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
ooh, I will go in on that with you! i could not think of anything.
okay.
(to her) oh, hey katie! everyone, this is katie.
so, are you ready to go?
oh sure, right back there. (points.)
i was thinking chinese food.
she is so cute! you could fit her right in your little pocket!
i do not know. i mean i like her a lot, and she is really nice, but…
but what?
(shyly) she keeps punching me.
in that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
hey, it is a lot harder than it looks! okay? (quietly) she-she-she is hurting me.
i know what you need, you need a bodyguard. hey ross, what is ben doing after preschool?
hey listen, come on, joey is having a problem! a little girl is beating him up.
aww, joey, come here. (she takes his hand.) look honey, i know this must be really, really difficult for you and i--oh, I am sorry. am i hurting you?
(opens it to reveal phoebe) hey!
hey! i brought you some house warming gifts.
aww.
yeah. salt, so your life always has flavor.
huh.
bread, so you never go hungry.
ohh.
and a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
thanks. thanks. and thanks again.
yeah!
hi!
oh hi! ross geller. and this is my friend phoebe.
mr. president.
howard?
oh that is nice.
oh. uhh…
no-no, it is not that, it is just… i-i just moved in.
yes, but I have lived here for 25 minutes.
no wait, look. look! I am sorry, it is just I have never even met howard. i-i mean i do not know howard.
yes but too me he is just, man.
(to phoebe) ugh, can you believe that guy!
yeah. i really like his glasses.
…so then president steve told everyone that i was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! a little kid spit on my knee! y'know what I am going to do? I am going to throw a party. that is right. for everyone in the building, and I am going to sit them down and explain to them, i am not a bad guy. i am not a cheap guy! I am just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. a man with principles.
(to rachel) sounds like a fun party.
hmm. look, ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why do not you just pay the hundred bucks? the party's going to cost you way more than that.
it does not matter! it is my principles! we are talking about my principles!
okay, i thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
oh, they will like me. once they come to my awesome par-tay! okay, i got to run. i got to go get some nametags. (exits.)
and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
very, very funny, but do not say things like that in front of monica. i do not want you putting any ideas in her head.
umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head.
wh-wh-why?!
well, because she loves you and because you love her.
yeah, so, what is that supposed to mean?!
hey, chandler, do not freak out! I am telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he did not want to have babies. and she is a woman, and she is almost 30, and y'know it is monica.
i do not see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who is to say what she wants?! I am right. I am right. am i right?
no, you are right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different.
okay. it is not different at all, is it?
not unless different means the same.
(sets the coffee down) y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
uhh, look katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. okay? umm, look i like you. i-i really do, i like you a lot. okay? but sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone is hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
is not this great?
hmm.
could not you just stay like this forever? (his eyes snap open.) chandler! could not you just stay here forever?
yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (gets up.)
are you okay?
yeah, I am cool. casual.
what-what are you doing?
I am just hanging out. y'know, having fun. y'know with the girl that I am seeing casually.
man, i knew it! i knew you were going to do this!!
what?!
get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
well, you do want all that stuff, right?
oh and you know what i want!
yes! you want babies! you have baby fever!
i do not have baby fever!
oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that is related to babies and-and marriage! I have got an idea, why do not we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
have you lost your mind? chandler, this is not about me! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
you do not know everything. did you know that I am going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm? and did you know that the only baby around here is you?! and did you know that i can not even look at you right now?! (she storms out.)
well, i did not know that.
it is going to be okay, right? i mean she is not going to leave me? this is, this is fixable.
by me?
oh, no!
no-no.
well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
yeah, big!
uh-oh, shht! the misses.
gunther, can i get a coffee (looks at chandler) to go?
monica. (goes to talk to her.)
I am still not done not wanting to talk to you.
just tell me what i need to do to make things right.
what?!
well, that is what we do. y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think I am all cute again.
really? I am really tired of being your relationship tutor. you are going to have to figure this one for yourself. all right? y'know what? if you are too afraid to be in a real relationship, then do not be in one. (she walks out.)
phoebe! (he grabs her arm to get her attention.)
oh, hi ross!
what are you doing?
oh, i thought this was your party and it turns out it is a party for howard. he is just the sweetest little man! (a guest walks up to her.)
you chipped in?!
yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.
phoebe! i can not believe you gave them money! i thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
yeah, but they did not ask me! y'know? this way I am just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. that is always fun to be.
yeah, but you are making me look bad!
no I am not. no! if anything I am making you look better! they will see you talking to me and that is--I am a hit!
hey!
yeah, okay, my bad.
hey!
hi! wow! you look, you look…big.
thanks! I have been working out. hey listen, is it obvious that I am wearing six sweaters?
uhhh, yeah. but it is not obvious why.
well look, I am breaking up with katie so i had to put on some extra padding. y'know? i mean, if she hits me when she is happy, can you imagine how hard she is going to hit me when i tell her I am taking away the joey love?
hey! hiya!
hey! hey, cute jacket!
oh! ow! (joey motions, "you see what i mean?!")
whoa! (laughs) y'know what katie? i got to tell ya i-i-i-i think you are the one who is too much. (she punches katie back.)
ohh, and the nicest girlfriend! (she retaliates.)
ohh, you are so sweet! (she kicks katie in the shin.)
huh.
uhh….
nah.
(trying to get her attention) phoebe?
(ignoring him and continuing her conversation) that is what I am saying. (laughs.)
(tapping her on the shoulder) phoebe? phoebe?
ooh. (turns to him.)
look, this is a disaster! can not i please just go?
no! no! I am talking you up to people. just give it a little time, all right? relax, get something to eat! okay?
so uh, what did you tell them about me?
oh, i was telling them about you and emily. y'know, try to get some sympathy.
ohh. (he cuts himself a piece of cake.)
but somehow you came off as the bad guy.
what?!
yeah, i think i told it wrong. y'know, we should talk about that because i do not totally understand what happened there.
(trying a piece of cake) ohh, this cake is really good!
oh, okay, see? things are looking up already!
all right, everyone calm down! everyone calm down! i have something that i would like to say! who here likes ross? (ross is the only one who raises his hand and phoebe glares at him to put his hand back down.) of course you do not like him! he-he did not give you any money, he raised his own hand when i asked, "who hear likes ross," and he is wearing two nametags! (he takes one off.) i-I will be honest with you guys, when i first met ross i did not like him at all! but then once i got to know him i saw that he is really sweet and caring and very generous. i mean, all I am saying is do not judge ross before you get to know him all right? i mean, i like all you guys now, but when i first meet you y'know kurt, i thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm lola, mind numbingly stupid! and okay, you guys (she turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who are a couple.) (to the girl) gold-digger, (to the old guy) cradle robbing perv! so, i think you all know what i mean.
obviously i did not think they were going to start throwing things. i just thought if i kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
oh wow, yeah! see, i did not get that.
where is monica?! where is she? i need to talk to her! it is urgent! is she here?
(raising her hand) I am monica.
i need to talk to you, it is urgent!
okay.
okay, I have been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there is only one-one way to do this. (he slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
(getting out a ring box) monica…
no-no, do not-do not-do not do it!
will you marry me?
oh-no. no. no.
what a bad idea!
ohhhh, i cannot look at it! (she does not move.)
chandler, why are you doing this?
i do not know. but i know I am not afraid to do this.
chandler.
I am doing this because I am sorry?
do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you are sorry?
no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (laughs.) will you be my wife?
(kneels with him) chandler, umm, i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
yeah, I am kind of wishing everyone was not here right now.
honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now!
yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys. (turns to look at ross and joey.)
who? two divorces and joey?!
hey!
she is right y'know.
yeah, but still, cheap shot!
y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you are not ready for that.
i did not think i was!
oh my god, what would have done if i said yes?
well i would have been happy because i would have be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would have seen a chandler shaped hole in that door. (points at the door.)
hey ross, will you pass me that knife?
no, i will not!
oh, it is okay. you do not have to be so mean about it.
you are right, I am sorry. will you marry me?
aw, and i was going to ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week.
oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but I am not sure, chandler?
okay, how long is this going to go on.
well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole "we were on a break thing?" well, I am sorry, will you marry me? (laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. they are just staring at him in shock.)
that is not funny.
that is not funny at all!
(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) okay. hey. umm. does everybody hate these shoes?
oh yeah, but do not worry. i do not think anybody's going to focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
(to ross) tell him.
(to chandler) it is her first day at this new job. your not supposed to start with her!
all right, i suppose i can wait a day. hey, what are you doing friday?
why?
i need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin albert, y'know he is the botanist.
oh god. y'know, botanists are such geeks.
yeah. is that a dinosaur tie?
hmm? oh, yeah. (he makes a growling sound)
(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) morning. rach, I am here with the purses!
(to phoebe) it must take you forever to find your keys.
(running into the living room) thank you, thank you, thank you, pheebs.
your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
no, no, no, no turtles scare me. i do not need that today.
honey, just relax, it is going to be fine. hey, umm,. why do not i come down there and I will take you out to lunch?
oh honey, thank you, but mark's taking me out.
mark is that ah, the same mark that helped you get the job?
yeah, it is kind of like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. (to phoebe) is this actually a lunchbox?
umm, no, it is a purse. and there is a thermos in it.
oh.
(to ross) hey, so can you make it on friday?
what? oh yeah, yeah i think so. why am i invited to this again?
well apparently albert has no friends. he is very excited about the bachelor party though. i think actually the only reason he is getting married is so he can see a stripper.
a stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich�. why do not you get a magician?!
well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
she is having lunch with him. she is having lunch with him. and you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. and, and, and, (to joey) he is really good looking. (joey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up) what am i going to do?
do not do anything. keep it inside. learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) do not cry outloud.
(hanging up the phone) yes! guess who is in an audition for a broadway musical?
i want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
it is me! it is a musical version of tale of two cities. so i think I am going to sing new york, new york, and ah, oh i left my heart in san francisco.
ah joey, i do not think you get to pick the cities.
what?
mr. dickens gets to pick  them.
who?
I will get you the cliff notes.
the what?
the abridgment.
oh, okay. (to ross) the what?
yeah. what kind of discount do we get?
oh!! i love this job! (her phone rings) wow! my first call.
(on phone) hi, is rachel there?
this is ross?
of ross and rachel.
oh hey, hey mark.
okay.
hi honey!
hi! what is ah, what is mark doing answering your phone?
oh, he is just goofing around.
ohhhhh yeah, that is, that is funny. why ah, why is not he goofing around in his own office?
oh honey, this is his office too. i told you we are joanna's two assistants.
why does joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
oh! oh my god! what did i just do?
what?
i think i just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. oh honey, i got to go. (to mark) mark, i need you!
okay, bye-bye. (starts slamming the receiver down in anger.)
ow! ross!!
oh, oh, I am, I am, I am sorry sweetie, i was just trying to ah, I am dialing another number. (hangs up)
please, I am not going for anything.
would you please go?
look julio, someone left their book here.
oh yeah, what are you reading?
have i read it? (pause) no, are you enjoying it?
your a poet and do not know it. (she turns away and makes a face like 'i can not believe i just said that.')
oh, then you do know it. (pause) so um what kind of things do you write about?
mine? (points to her lower lip) right here?
how would that go? (they kiss) well, it did not rhyme, but i liked it.
(singing) you have got to pick a pocket or two. boyyyyssss, (picks a handkerchief from the pianist's pocket) you have got to pick a pocket or two..........
really? thanks.
excellent, I will be there.
ahhh! my ah, my agent said it was not a dancing part.
....three years of modern dance with twila tharp! five years with the american ballet theater?!
hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. i was not one of the zoom kids either.
well, can you dance at all?
yeah, i can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)
oh no, no, no, no.
(covering her mouth in shock) what, what is that?
sure, it looks stupid now, there is no music playing.
all right, i have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) hello? (listens) (happily) hi! yeah listen, I am, I am in need of a stripper and i was told that you do that. (listens) let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? (listens) so would i, would i have to provide the grapes?
(entering) hi!
oh, how was last night with julio, senorita?
it was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. oh gosh, i got to so you this. last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
get out! i could not stop if a meteor hit me.
okay, we have our stripper. a miss crystal chandelier.
well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. now, i am like totally dense about poetry, but i think it is pretty good all right. check it out. (hands them the poem)
(reading) the empty vase. translucent beauty...
to yourself. (finishing) hey-hey-hey, y'know what that is pretty good.
oh good, i think so too. pheebs?
oh yeah.
oh, I am so glad you guys like it. yay! all right i got to go to work. (tries to take the poem)
whoa, I am not done.
all right, just give it back to me when your done. see you guys.
bye-bye.
oh my god, oh my god! poor monica!
what, what, what?!
what?! he was with her when he wrote this poem. look, (reading) 'my vessel so empty with nothing inside. now that I have touched you, you seem emptier still.' he thinks monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
you really think that is what he meant?
oh, totally. oh, god, oh, she seemed so happy too.
done.
oh, yeah, sure, it is umm... (she picks up this bug and it starts to play the theme from love story)
it is from ross, it is a love bug.
oh no, no-no-no, that is not, not, not, what he is doing. he is just, he is just really romantic.
yes.
I am hurt! I am actually hurt, that you would think that i would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. hurt! hurt!
all right ross!! i get it!!
i mean my god...
you are hurt!
...can not, can not a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
oh, please, ross it was so obvious! it was like you were marking your territory. i mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
i would never do that!
look, i know what is going on here, okay, mark explained it all to me. he said this is what you guys do.
yeah well if, if, if mark said that, than mark's an idiot.
mark's a genius!
why?! how?! how is he a genius?
look, do not you see what is happening here. instead of hitting on her right away, he is becoming her confidant. now he is going to be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
what am i going to do?
well, why do not you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. all right look, you are going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
i do not know you guys.
all right fine, do not do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. and he is being mr. joe sensitive, and she starts thinking 'maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
and before you know it, she is with him. and you will be all, 'ohh, man!' and he will be all, 'yes!' and us, we will be like, 'wh-whoa, dude.' and pretty soon you will be like, (sadly) 'hhiii,' and, and, and, 'i can not go, rachel and mark might be there.' and we will be like, 'man get over it, it is been four years!!'
he paints quite a picture does not he?
ohhh! that is soo sweet! (gets up to get herself a cup of coffee)
all right that is, that is it!! get off her!
what is going on?! (throws the love bug at him) that is what is going on!!
(now standing behind ross) ross!
i have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! what do i have to do to get some service?! (turns to rachel) hi rach. (he is puts his hand on her shoulder and she knocks it away.)
so, does that mean the audition is off?
what?!
it is ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
bye. (does the jazz hands)
(entering) hey!
hey.
what are you wrapping?
oh-ho, look what i got julio.
yeah, it is a vase.
yeah, just like the one in the poem.
well not exactly like the one in the poem.
what do you mean?
remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? oh. (hugs her)
(to julio) so! I am just an empty vase, huh?
y'know, so i do not read as many important books as you do, and i do not write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. and y'know what, i get excited about stupid stuff, like when i my people magazine comes on saturday, and the new hold everything catalog. y'know but that does not mean that I am empty, i care about things. i care about my friends and family. you have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
you do not even know me...
what?
I am sorry, my friend phoebe...
(sarcastically) oh yeah.
i know, it was the best i could get out of them.
people, people, people.
so ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
oh yeah, yeah! look what i got, look what i got. (holds up a pen) see, she is fully dressed, right?
right.
and then you click it and, uh-oh, she is naked. and then, and then you click it again and she is dressed. she is a business woman, she is walking down the street, she is window shopping, and (clicks pen) whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she is naked! (rachel just stares at him.)
(entering) hi.
hello.
y'know what, I am, I am going to spend some alone time with the pen.
(sits down next to her) I am sorry, i was an idiot.
a big idiot.
a big idiot. just you have to realize is, this whole mark thing is kind of hard for me.
honey, why is it hard, i mean we have been together for almost a year now?
well, i was with carol for like eight years and i lost her. and now if it is possible i think i love you even more. so, it is hard for me to believe that I am not going to, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
honey, that is very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there is no reason to be jealous. (she kisses him)
i got to get going. bye chandler.
oh, okay ross. listen, this pen is kind of getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
where ya going?
oh, I have got to go pick up ben, we have got a play date this afternoon.
ohh, with who?
oh, just this woman that i met last night at the party.
there was a woman at the... (realizes) the stripper?!
yeah.
you have a play date with a stripper?!
man, i got to get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
ah, yeah, yeah. umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. and it turns out she is got a boy about ben's age, so we are taking them to a gym-boree class. why, is that okay?
sure, is she married?
ahh, no.
oh. (starts shaking the sugar down in a packet really hard.)
are you jealous?
noo, i y'know i do not see why she has to play with you, that is all. i mean does not she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
you are totally jealous.
I am not jealous. all right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. and y'know, and um, i...
honey, i love you too.
ugh. wait, wait, wait.
what?
huh.
(to chandler) well, there is a kiss that he will not forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
yeah. either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
oh, phoebe, are you still on hold? i was supposed to call my dad back like two hours ago.
oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he is at flimby’s.
what is flimby’s?
oh, yeah, that is the word i use when i can not remember the real thing.
okay. hang up! that is it! come on!
no! rachel, that is what they want me to do. my warranty expires tomorrow, if i do not get through, they are not going to fix my crappy, broken phone for free! we cannot let them win! it is us versus them!

uh, no, it is-it is just this person.
like a date type (looks at rachel) person?
yeah, kind of. it is this woman from work. i hope that will not be too weird. will it, rach?
no. no, not at all, not at all. i actually was going to bring someone myself, so…

(starts to put on the sweater) do not-do not switch or anything, ‘because I am, I am right here. (she has pulled the sweater over her head, but her head is stuck in a sleeve.) just one sec. one sec! one second!! (she is now frantically trying to get the sweater on, as monica returns from the bathroom.) wait! one second! just…

of course not.
no.
okay. i just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.

no! the guy is mean. i mean really mean. i think you should stay away from him.
umm, or, maybe, i should stay away from all men.
no, it is not just ‘because I am jealous. (both monica and chandler give him a ‘come on’ look) i mean I am not, I am not, I am not jealous, okay? it is… look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.

(stunned) what?!
oh, ahh, go to the window. I am want to run down to the truck and show you something.
(grabs the window from the outside and sticks his head in) (whispering) when is she leaving?
(making like he is yelling up to the second floor) I am coming up!
oh, i… (starts jabbering incoherently)
why do not you use ours across the hall, ‘because she…has…problems.
(coming out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee, almost running into tommy) oh-ho, whoa! sorry, tommy. i almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
no, but it is-it is-it is hot!
ross, would you just stop it! it is getting really old.
i can not believe no one believes me!
i do, i believe you.
you do pheebs?
yeah. but i also believed her (points to the phone) when she said i was next.
step away from the duck.
hey!
wh-wh-what is going on? wh-what is this about l.a.?
but, but wh-what about us?
well, so, stay for the museums!
well can you at least stay to the end of the play? i mean, I will go to the airport with ya, i-i want to say good bye.
(to lauren) in a minute!!
yeah, i guess it is. (sees kate is watching, he turns lauren so that he can talk directly to kate, but still look like he is talking to lauren) listen, i ah, i got to say good bye, and-and i got to say it quick ‘because this is killing me. one thing you got to know, is that i will never forget you. but, you have got things you have to do now, and so do i. and so… I am going to get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I am going to go to blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. but when i return, 200 years from now, you will be long gone. but i will not have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) so you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because adrienne, baby, I am going to want to meet her.
phoebe, it is been two days.
yeah, i know. oh, good thing it is one of those 801 numbers. right?
phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is utah.
no, no, no, oh no-no-no, it is has to be 800. (picks up the instruction manual to check the phone number) ‘because all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. (finds the number) yeah, every big utah-based company has one.
phoe-be!!
sorry, I am so sorry, i will pay you back.
and yet, she is still not hanging up the phone.
fine! fine! (slams the phone down, breaking it) oh-oh!
what?
well, i think i broke it. but that is all right, here is the number you can call.
(sarcastic) oh.
(in a sexy voice) come in. I have been waiting for you.
hi! i just want to-(sees monica)-ahhh!!! oh my god! (she runs out in horror.) oh my god!
(pulling on a robe) okay, I am sorry! I am sorry! i-i-i was um, i was taking a nap.
since when do take naps in that position. oh god monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
yes. yes, i was. a guy. from work. (thinks) I am seeing a guy from work! ha!
(gasps) that cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening ray liotta?
uh-huh, that one!
y'know what, just give me a second and I will be out of your hair. I am just going to grab a jacket. when i get back, i want every little detail. (there is a knock on the door.) maybe that is him. (goes to answer the door.)
(panicking) okay, umm, okay, umm… (rachel opens the door.) it is just joey and ross.
why are not you guys at the movie?
well, we were! but ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
i had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
(to monica and rachel) he is talking to london!
but why?! did he get in touch with emily?
well no, not yet. he is calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
(on phone) i-i-i do not care if i said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
ross! way to suck up to the family.
(entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that monica is the only one there) ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I am so glad you guys are all here! my office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
(entering, wearing a tux) hey!
oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! no-no, vomit tux!
do not worry, i had it dry-cleaned.
vomit tux? who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to joe?
well, I am doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co-host!
oh that is great!
a little uh, good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure, now that is the kind of math joey likes to do!
ugh, pbs!
what is wrong with pbs?
ugh, what is right with them?
why do not you like pbs, pheebs?
okay, because right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. so, i just thought that it would make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street, because they were so nice when i was a little kid! no one ever wrote back.
well y'know a lot of those muppets do not have thumbs.
all i got was a lousy key chain! and by that time i was living in a box. i did not have keys!
I am sorry pheebs, i just, y'know, i just wanted to do a good deed. like-like you did with the babies.
this is not a good deed, you just wanted to get on tv! this is totally selfish.
whoa! whoa! whoa! what about you, having those babies for your brother? talk about selfish!
what-what are you talking about?!
well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
yeah. so?
it made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. look, there is no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
yes there are! there are totally good deeds that are selfless.
well, may i ask for one example?
yeah, it is… y'know there is—no you may not!
that is because all people are selfish.
are you calling me selfish?!
are you calling you people? (chandler rolls his eyes.) yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds do not exist. okay? and you the deal on santa clause right?
I am going to find a selfless good dead. I am going to beat you, you evil genius.
(on phone) hello.
emily? emily! oh my god! oh my god, it is emily! (he picks up a lamp and hands it to chandler, for no reason.) it is emily everyone! shush-shush-shhst! (to emily) hi!
no wait! look, wait! okay, you can hang up, but I am going to keep calling! I am going to, I am going to call everyone in england if that is what it takes to get you to talk to me!
look you are my wife. we are-we are married. y'know? i-i love you. i-i really miss you.
(to the gang, whispering) she is talking.
hey, joey, when you said the deal with santa clause, you meant?
that he does not exist.
right. (she turns and opens her eyes in shock.)
so chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend?
uhh, yeah. she uh, she uh, she uh might have mentioned him.
so mon, when are we going to meet this new secret waiter man?
ohh, he is really shy. i-i do not think he is up to meeting everyone yet.
yeah, i do not think he is up to meeting everyone yet.
i do not care! i want to meet this guy who is the best sex she ever had!
really?! that is what you heard? (to monica) you said that?
i might have said that. (chandler laughs.) why is that funny?
because I am very happy for him! (to monica) and you, you lucky dog!
(entering) hi!
hey!
well, emily's willing to work on the relationship.
yes!
that is great!
in london!
what?!
she wants me to move to london.
but you live here! (ross rolls his eyes.) you know that.
what-what-what are you going to do?
i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben.
yeah, I am sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
it could happen.
(to the pledge volunteers) how ya doing? welcome. good to see ya!
that is great. but uh, I am not really expecting a lot of calls.
but I am the host!
you do not seem to understand. see, i was dr. drake remoray.
i cannot believe i can not find a selfless good deed! y'know that old guy that lives next to me? well, i snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. but he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. then i felt wonderful. that old jackass!
maybe joey's right. maybe all good deeds are selfish.
i will find a selfless good deed! because i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right!
(entering) hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question?
sure!
if you are cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard?
chandler! (pause) is he?
well, y'know i-i-i think I am going to respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you would ever had, I would be going like this. (he jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
all right emily, as much as i love you, I am sorry, i can not move to london without ben.
yeah, would you please consider moving here? i mean you were going to move here anyway, why can not you just do that?
oh-oh-okay, but-but i know, that even though I have been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, i mean, i mean you-you-you have to come here. you have to come here so we can work this out.
all right, did you just say all right?
oh, emily that is, that is so great. it is going to be so great! we are going to be like-like-like two idiots in love!
yes, tell me.
i know. i am, i am so sorry.
again, very sorry.
emily, there is nothing between rachel and me. okay? i love you.
oh that is so great! that is…
so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes.
yes!
ooh-ohh!
great!
no-no-no! only if i promise never to see rachel again.
why?
what?! you can not—what did you tell her?
i told her I would have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision? (they are all quiet.) I am actually asking you!
well, you can not just not see rachel anymore, she is one of your best friends.
yeah! but, he can not not exactly see emily, i mean that is his wife.
yeah.
that is true!
yeah, but you have known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
that is true!
no, you cannot.
thanks for the help, problem solved. (wipes his hands.)
(answering it) hello.
(on phone) hey mon!
oh hey joey! we have been watching all day, when are you going to be on tv?
see, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I am still on tv and that is good exposure.
(looking at the tv) you are not on tv.
oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (he waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on tv.)
hey, there he is! there he is!
hello new york! (the woman bats his hand out of the way.)
how many times have i told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
(entering) hi chandler.
hey!
uh, listen, i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day.
oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
william sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.
expect it in 4-6 weeks. (she starts to leave.) umm, hey, umm, joey's going to be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
yeah, so?
well i just, thought maybe you would want to book some time with the best you would ever had.
y'know what, champ? i think I will pass.
why?
why? (she hops into the living room and imitates chandler's happy dance.)
what is your point?
(in a bored voice) pbs telethon.
(on phone from central perk) hey joey, i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed. i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me.
what?! what good is that going to do anybody?
well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. the bee is happy and i am definitely not.
now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
(thinks for a moment.) aw, dammit! (slams the phone down.)
hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
come on man! you have been here all day!
(entering) okay, that is it. i cannot make this decision! it is too difficult, so I am just going to leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (he holds up and starts shaking a…)
a magic eight ball?! you can not be serious, you can not make this decision with a toy!
ooh, it is not a toy.
well, i do not know what else to do. i mean, i either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I am 30! so-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let us hear it! because i-i got nothing! all right, do not be shy, any suggestion will do. (there are none.) okay then. here we go. magic 8 ball, should i never see rachel again? (he turns it over and reads the answer) ask again later. later is not good enough. (he shakes it up again and reads the answer.) ask again later. what the hell! this is broken! it-it is broken!
all right, let me see. (she grabs the 8 ball.) will chandler have sex tonight? (reads the answer.) do not count on it. seems like it works to me.
(in an unenthusiastic voice) pbs telethon.
(on phone) hi joey.
hey pheebs!
i would like to make a pledge. i would like to donate $200.
$200? are you sure pheebs? i mean, after what sesame street did to ya?
oh, I am still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who is moms did not kill themselves, so by supporting them, I am doing a good thing, but I am not happy about it. so there, a selfless good deed.
and you do not a little good about donating the money?
no, it sucks. i was saving up to buy a hamster.
a hamster? what, those things are like 10 bucks.
yeah, not the one i had my eye on.
oh, look-look, joey's on tv! is not that great? my pledge got joey on tv! oh that makes me feel—oh no! (realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it is selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)
(entering) look, maybe i got carried away before. but there is something you got to know. if I am the best, it is only because you have made me the best.
keep talking.
i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which would not take long. but when I am with you, and we are together, oh…my…god.
really?
oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. we are too good! we owe it, to sex!
well, if we owe it? (she throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) oh my… when is joey going to be home?
well, i was kind of hoping we could do this without him. (she starts to take off her latex gloves.) oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
but, i just cleaned the bathroom.
yeah, why do not we lose the gloves.
yeah. (she takes them off.)
all right, let us show them how it is done.
okay.
ow!
y'know that was not part of it?
i know!
(entering) hi! are you ready? we are going to be late!
for what?
for stella! remember? she is gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
yeah, i uh, totally forgot about that. you mind if i take a rain check? I am waiting for a call from emily.
sure. i guess. hey, i hear you do not have to go to london. yay!
it is not that easy, there is still a lot of relationship stuff.
like what?
just stuff. y'know kind of what emily wants.
well, why do not you talk to me about it, maybe i can help.
no. no. you-you can not help. i mean, i kind of have to do this without your help.
well, i-i know you can do that too. I am just, I am just saying if you need somebody to talk to… hi!
thanks.
ross? look, whatever this relationship stuff that emily wants, just give it to her. come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. so just fix whatever she wants fixed. just do it. (the phone starts ringing.) i mean, you are going to have to try. you will just going to hate yourself if you do not. (the phone keeps ringing.) oh come on answer it! it is driving me crazy!
(answering the phone.) hello. (listens) hi sweetie. (listens.) good. look umm, yes I have been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, i can do it. (rachel gives him a thumbs up.) so will you come to new york? (rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him. all the time not knowing what is going on.)
never done that before.
nope.
(entering in a bathrobe) i just walked in the bathroom and saw kathy naked! it was like torture!
y'know if we ever go to war and you are captured, you are in for a big surprise.
it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean it is bad enough that I am in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, i think she knows. because every time we are in the room together there is this weird like energy between us. and call me crazy, but i think she likes me too. and now i have seen her naked. i mean at least when I have seen her with clothes on, i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. but there are no boles, she is smooth! smooth! (leaves)
wow! could everyone totally see up his robe?
great! all right, so I will call you later.
(rushing up) hey-hey-hey! who was that?
that would be casey. we are going out tonight.
going out, huh? wow! wow! (does a little celebration dance) so things did not work out with kathy, huh? bummer.
no, things are fine with kathy. I am having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with casey.
(shocked) what?
yeah-yeah. and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself! (laughs)
wait! you are going out with kathy!
yeah. why are you getting so upset?
well, I am upset—for you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (he can not believe he just sad that.)
what is the big deal? it is not like we are exclusive.
look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that she is-she is smart, and funny, and gets you.
you got all that from the back of her head?
all right look, i think it is time for you to settle down. y'know? make a choice, pick a lane.
who is elaine?
(singing) "little, tiny tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. swinging with the greatest of ease…" darn it! now, i do not know who to get to the next verse.
oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease… (plays air guitar) bah-bah-bha-bhannn." then go right into it.
yeah, ooh, i like that! yeah. wait! how do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’
well umm, y’know, i used to play.
oh yeah, that is right, the keyboards, huh?
yeah, just a little in high school, but then i really got into it in college. i mean that is-that is when i really found my sound.
oh god! orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. oh my god, i completely forgot about your sound.
yeah.
he used to lock himself in the basement for hours. no one was every allowed to hear, "the sound."
i want to hear "the sound."
really? no. i mean, nah, i have not played in so long, and-and, well it is-it is really personal stuff, y’know?
come on, play that funky music white boy.
yeah!
no, you guys, i mean my keyboards are all the way up in—no, yeah, okay. (runs out.)
okay, guys.
all right! bring it on, you…
here we go. (plays one note) y’know, I have-I have never played my stuff for anyone before, so it is important that-that you understand it is about communicating very private emotions. (plays another note) y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. that is what I am…
(interrupting) oh my god! play!
(at a loss for words) boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.
really, bitchin’!
wow, it was so—wow!
really?! i mean, really?!!
yeah, i mean, you should play in public!
wow! thanks, you guys. that is uh—ohhh, i want to, i want to play you another piece! umm! uh-oh! i left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I will be right back! okay? (runs to fetch them) this is so nice, I am—i am so… (starts to break up and leaves)
oh god bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
oh, i can not believe i ever let him touch me with those fingers.
what are you guys talking about, i loved it! it was soo moving. oh, plus it is just, it is so different from the stuff you usually hear.
you mean like, music?
yeah, i know what you are thinkin’! yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
come in!
uh yes, but uh, i just watch it for the articles.
no-no, he is not back yet, but he will be here any minute. so uh, come on in. have a seat. bow or stern?
i like it in the stern. (realizes what he just said.) …of the boat. (the phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) hello.
(on the other end at a pay phone) hey, it is me. listen casey and i were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
what happened?
we broke down on the parkway, so i have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. and hey, listen could you please tell kathy that I will be there as soon as i can.
why can not you tell her?
‘because i only have one quarter, and i think my time is about to—(he stops talking suddenly)
joey! joey!!
yeah?
i thought your time ran out.
me too, but i guess i do have a couple of more—(his time runs out for real)
(to kathy) uhh, that was joey. he is running a little late, he says he is sorry.
so i guess it is just uh, you and me then.
yeah, i think it is!
oh, i had an appointment to get my haircut…
…and then it got canceled.
really?! you do that?
dog grooming huh? okay, just do not make my tail too poofy.
well, thanks. i grow it myself. (kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) y’know who also has great hair is joey!
what-what ‘cha doing?
‘kay.
(jumping up to answer the phone) oh the phone! the phone’s making sounds! (on phone) hello!
(on phone) hey dude, it is me.
hey it is joey!
listen uh, I am really sorry, it looks like I am going to be stuck here for a while. i got the transmission fluid, but when i went to put it in the car, the transmission was not there!
what?
yeah, it must have fallen out a few blocks back. i just figured we hit a dog.
okay.
listen uh, could you put kathy on, i want to apologize.
oh yeah man. (to kathy) joey. (hands her the phone.)
yeah. yes! yeah.
oh.
no-no-no-no, this is bad! it is bad! this is bad!
wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
okay!
ooh! yes! okay! here is what we do, we-we forget it happened.
okay, we-we swallow our feelings. even if it means we are unhappy forever. sound good?
i have to; he is my best friend, and you are seeing him.
(interrupting) oh-no-no-no! do not! do not! see-see, you are getting me confused, I am starting to urn.
i-i think we have too.
bye. (kathy leaves and chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) are you still out there?
(his voice is altered to sound like a computer.) electrifying. (he plays the sound of a ticking clock.) emphatic time-time-time…
(to rachel and phoebe) y'know, there is a starbucks about three blocks down.
(pushing monica back onto the couch) it is so inspired! look at him! look at him go!
(with the altered voice) thank you guys-guys-guys…
(to phoebe) hey, are not you up next?
oh no, I am not playing tonight.
why not?
i can not follow ross! it would be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed the beetles. no.
phoebe, ross sucks!
phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
oh my god, he is not even appreciated in his own time. i would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
okay. umm, phoebe, you suck too.
yeah, phoebe you are… awful!
you guys. you suck too. (she hugs them both.)
aww man! i can not believe i locked myself out again! (he knocks on the door.)
hang on buddy! (he goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
(rushing in) oh my god! what happened here? did you do all this?
i sure did.
why?
well, i just thought it would make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
well, you are amazing.
oh no-no-no. this is amazing. (he goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the tv.)
(very excited) a tv as if it appears from nowhere! that is the dream! man, how did you afford this stuff?
well, y’know I am 29. i mean who needs a savings account.
oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
oh, i do not know.
oh-no-no-no, you are! you do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, i was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I am going to do that.
you mean with casey.
no-no-no, i think I am going to see how things go with kathy. she is pretty cool.
or casey.
no-no, kathy.
could be casey.
no. no, kathy.
consider casey.
y’know what i think? i think somebody is got a little crush on casey. how ‘bout i fix you two up? what do you think?
that all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
(to phoebe) hey!
hey! you were really great! you were really, really great!
oh, thanks, thanks. so monica tells me that uh, you do not want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. is that true?
well, kind of. yeah. yeah.
pheebs…
yeah, i-i can not—i mean y’know i was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, i just—i feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. i…
see but, pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then i… i will not play anymore.
oh no. no-no-no, do not do that! how could i live with myself if i knew i was depriving the world of your music.
yeah, okay.
hey chandler! saw the new furniture. very nice.
yeah! joey has the best boyfriend ever!
i kissed kathy.
what?
are you serious?
does joey know?
no. is there anyway, anyway you think he will understand this?
you obviously have not screwed over a lot of your friends. (they all look at her) which we all appreciate.
no the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing joey, he probably just would have just stepped aside.
oh, do not say that! do not say that. that is not true. is it?
i think maybe, yeah.
he loves you.
then why did not you tell me to do that?!!
well, i said-i said something to phoebe.
yeah! no, that is right. and i thought it was a really good idea.
i know, i remember that!
i remember you did.
god!! (sits down in disgust.) what am i going to do?!
well, chandler, you are going to have to tell him.
why?! why do i have to tell him?!
because you do.
yeah, i know.
hey, would it be okay if i wrote a song about this.
hey!
hey! samboucha margarita?
is that a real thing?
well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
listen ah, joe, i-i need to, i need to talk to you about something.
what is up?
it is-it is about kathy. umm, uh, i like her. i like her a lot actually.
you do?
yeah.
well, you are timing could not be better. she is not my girlfriend anymore.
what?
yeah, she broke up with me.
oh uh, when?
just now, after acting class. at first i thought she was doing some kind of scene, that is why i let people watch.
oh man, i am so sorry. are, are you okay?
well, I have been better. but, I am all right. so you like her huh?
yes, but i-i uh, do not have too.
no-no-no, no it is uh, it is okay.
yeah?
yeah. you know why? ‘because you came to me first.
well, i thought that would be the best thing to do.
but hey, listen just so you know, you might have you are work cut out for you. ‘because when i talked to her, i kind of got the feeling that she is into some other guy. so…
see uh, that is-that is actually what i wanted to talk to you about. i-i think i know who the other guy is.
who?
it is me. I am the other guy.
what?
yeah, i mean when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking, and one thing to another and…
and what?! did you sleep with her?!
no! no! no! i just kissed her.
what?!! that is even worse!!
how is that worse?!
i do not know! but it is the same!
look, I am sorry! but there is nothing i can do, i think I am in love with her!
who cares?! you went behind my back! i would never do that to you!
you are right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line.
over the line?! you-you are-you are so far past the line, that you-you can not even see the line! the line is a dot to you!
yes. yes! right! and i feel horrible. you have to believe me!
is that why you bought all this stuff?! (chandler makes a face like "well, kind of.") well, y’know what i will not watch your tv, i will not listen to your stereo, and there is a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I am not going to eat! you know why?!
probably because…
because it is all tainted with your betrayal. from now on this apartment is empty for me! and I am not happy about you either. (the bread maker dings) oh, and just so you know, i made that bread for you. (joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)
oh my god, he is lost it. he is totally lost it.
(removing ear plugs) what?
phoebe, his music could not get any worse. there are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
thank you, thanks. (sits down next to the girls) yeah, i lost it. y’know, I am not going to play anymore, (to phoebe) would you, can you finish my set?
after that? yeah! no, i mean if i can help.
yeah, like i could lose it.
what?
i played bad on purpose guys.
okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
yeah—no, just that last song.
hey! out of all of us, who do you think is going to get married next?
probably monica and chandler.
(to the gang) oh my god, melissa warburton. i do not think i have the energy for this.
(screaming) melissa!
wh—(turns and looks at the gang who is staring)—why do not i tell you over here? (she walks melissa away from the gang.)
oh no-no, no! it is good! it is all good! i-i actually work at ralph lauren!
i will not! I am the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
oh please…
no.
oh tomorrow, oh i do not know. um…
shut up.
oh, wow thanks! (reading the card) oh you are in real estate!
wow! what do you do now?
okay! (joins the rest of the gang.)
hey guys! look who is back! it is ray-ray!
shut up that was my friend melissa from college.
she seems really, really fun!
she is actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
wait a minute, she is not… she is not the one who you…
(excitedly) who you what? who you what?!
(to monica) yes.
wow!
(excitedly) wow? wow what?! wow what?! who you—what?!!
it is not a big deal!
(to joey) they were lovers.
what?!
what?!
no we were not! it was nothing! it was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.
so that is two of my wives.
(telling chandler the seating arrangement) okay so this is where the band is. (points.) and this is where the bar is. (points) and all these pins have people’s names on them. (she has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) and rach, here you are. (points to rachel’s place.)
oh wow. why do not we just take me (grabs her pin) and put me with a manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (puts her pin at the bar and laughs. monica just glares at her.) these pins are not for playing are they?
(to chandler) okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
this is so sad. i mean, i only have like ten pins.
chandler, relax it is not a contest. (to rachel) certainly not a close one.
(entering) hello!
hey!
hey rach. (stares at her.)
stop picturing it!!
okay, i think that is it. the seating chart is done. this is our wedding. they all look like they are having fun do not they?
hey, so where are my parents going to be?
oh! (gets up) let us see, well…if this is the wedding hall then umm (walks away) you are parents will be at home in queens.
what they are not invited?! oh no, that is terrible! they are going to be crushed!
why would they think they are invited?
(looking around) you got me. i do not…
joey!
well, I am sorry. i thought parents were coming! y’know? your parents are comin’! chandler’s parents are comin’! ross’s parents are comin’!
ross’s parents are my parents!
well-well—see? parents are comin’!
y’know i think we should invite them.
oh please, you just want more blue pins.
well this is just sad!
all right, all right. maybe i can fit them in if i just do some rearranging. but uh, rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
that is not a problem.
(leaning down to her) maybe you will order a little sangria?
oh, get out of here! (jumps back and walks away.)
(motioning to a rack) so now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there is anything that you like, we can make you a deal. anything at all. (grabs a few) but these are the three that monica pre-approved.
well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up rach. i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I am monica’s maid of honor. okay? do not try to blue pin me!
(sees another rack) well, what is the deal with these? these-these look nice.
oh they are nice. we-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they are done with them they just send ‘them back.
you mean like for award shows?
some of them.
you mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "you are you wearing?! you look fabulous!"
honey, might i suggest watching a little more espn and a little less e!?
okay, who wore those? (points to the tuxedos.)
umm, well let us see uh, this one is tom brokaw.
not bad.
(reading a tag) this one is uh paul of’neil.
who is that?
he plays for the yankees. seriously, espn! just once and a while, have it on in the background. (chandler nods and rachel grabs another tux) ooh, this one was pierce brosnan!
pierce brosnan?
uh-huh.
are you serious?
yeah.
007?! this is james bond’s tux?!
yeah.
oh, i have to get married in james bond’s tux!
it is a pretty cool tux.
oh, it is not just that, i would be england’s most powerful weapon. jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. a man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (worried.) would monica let me wear this?
we should really learn how to play the real way. (moves another piece.)
i like our way. oh! (grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of joey’s like in checkers.) chess!
nice move.
yeah.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey!
so joey i just hooked ross and chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
no, I am performing the ceremony. I am not wearing a tux.
well, what are you going to wear?
multi-colored robes! ooh, and maybe a hat.
huh. does monica know about this?
i do not think so.
can i please be there when you tell her? (joey nods yes.)
hey oh, rach wait! do you want to go to a movie tonight?
oh, y’know what? i can not. i have to have dinner with that melissa girl.
(excitedly) can i come?! i will not even talk! you will just hear the noise from my video camera.
what is this? what is going on?
oh good! can i tell her?! can i tell her?!
well, do you want to hear what actually happened or joey’s lewd version?
joey’s!
okay…
hey, come on! i had this friend from college and i made the stupid mistake of telling joey that one time…she and i y’know…kissed a little bit.
(laughs) yeah, I am sure that happened.
it-it did!
sure!
hey. (laughs then seriously) it happened!
yeah, it was senior year in college. it was after the sigma chi luau and melissa and i got very drunk! and we ended up kissing! for several minutes!
(to joey) which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
why are you taking this away from me?
yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
okay! i just—i did not know that you are a lesbian. (joey smiles and nods lewdly.)
I am not saying that I am a lesbian! I am just saying that this happened!
okay, it just seems pretty wild and you are so—y’know so…vanilla.
(shocked) vanilla?!
yeah.
I am not vanilla! I have done lots of crazy things! i mean i got-i got drunk and married in vegas!
to ross.
all right, y’know what? if you do not want to believe me about this, why do not you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
okay! all right! yeah! ‘because i just can not picture it.
oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
hey! guess what i got for your wedding! (holding up his garment bag.)
a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
no. rachel hooked me up with a tux! but not just any tux, batman’s tux!
what?
that is right! made expressly for val kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that batman film he was in.
you can not wear that! I am wearing the famous tux! james bond’s tux!
so?
so—if you wear that you will make mine less special.
well, you need something to make this day special? hello! you-you-you have the most special thing of all! you are marrying the woman you love.
please, do not take away my cool thing. please?! pretty please?!
pretty please? not very uh, 007.
look, it is my wedding day okay? if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you.
when i got married you slept with my sister.
that was pretty 007.
hey.
hey. oh good-good you are here! all right, i figured it out. I am going to take two tables of eight, I am going to add your parents, and I am going to turn them into three tables of six. okay? and i called the caterer; i added two extra meals, we are good to go!
yeah, they are not coming.
(looking at him) what?!
somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. they…feel a little unwanted.
oh that is too bad. it is true, but too bad.
look mon, if you could just call my mom…
oh joey!
come on! look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. let us not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
no she has not.
is it her fault that some of them did not make it to you?
well, what am i going to say?
i do not know. just uh, just tell ‘them it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—no-no-no! blame it on the post office. they hate the post office. and the irish! but i do not think you can blame it on them so… (he dials the phone and hands it to monica.)
(on phone) hello? (listens) yeah, hi! mrs. tribbiani? (listens) hi, this is monica geller. (listens) yeah I am just calling to say that chandler and i uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent were not delivered. umm, i guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (joey nods his approval.) (listens) t-tell me about it! (listens) yeah, yeah, the us post office? no, more like us lost office! (listens) what are they irish?! (joey gives her a thumbs up.)
oh. oh, that is great!
of course! yeah, i was uh, umm thigh mega tampon.
yeah! y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when regina philange died of alcohol poisoning.
(changing the subject) anyway, speaking of drinking too much. i was uh, tellin’ phoebe about that one crazy night after the sigma chi luau where you and i uh, we made out.
remember?! we—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
…we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
really?!
ross is batman!
well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman. okay batman is so much cooler than james bond!
what are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
batman has a utility belt!
007 has a fancy car!
batman has the batmobile!
007 gets all the ladies.
batman has robin! (pause) we get espn right?
how about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I will make you a nice martini.
actually, i do not like martinis.
how about a youhoo with a funny straw?
ooh, yum! (runs into the bedroom.)
(entering) hey.
hey.
listen, i know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is going to start right at six?
the show?!
right. right. the wedding, gotcha. but i mean, it is going to start a little late right? i mean, weddings start late. right?
have you ever been to one of my weddings?
ah. yeah. well look, the thing is it is the same day as my niece’s christening and i really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘because my part’s just in the beginning I am not even in the rest of the show—wedding!
the wedding starts at six.
okay. okay, i totally hear ya. oo how about this? i vamp a little ‘til they get there?
you will vamp?!
yeah! yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. ask ‘them where they are from. ‘because in joey tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I am a minis-tainer! (rapping) there is no one better! there is no one greater!
how can you not remember us kissing?!
wh… come on! remember? we were on the sleeping porch! we could not stop giggling? and our coconuts kept knockin’ together?
oh, somewhere joey’s head is exploding.
yeah—but come on—listen, I am sorry i do not want to make you uncomfortable, but i told phoebe that it happened and she does not believe me.
no!!
rachel, it is okay. you do not have to do this. i believe you. all right? okay, if-if you say that you kissed melissa, then you kissed melissa.
thank you phoebe.
i know.
hey!
you just carry that around?
yes. i find it to be something of a conversation piece.
between you and…
gunther. (to chandler) hey-hey! why do not we put them on? y’know get a picture of batman and james bond together.
i would but mine does not fit. the pants are a little tight.
a little tight? i could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
well that stinks. i was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
well, does that mean that you are not going to wearing yours?
what are you kidding? it is batman’s tux!!
(standing up) let me try it on!
okay, but just the jacket. double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.
(trying on the jacket) okay. holy double-vented comfort batman! (finds something in the pocket) what is this?
what?
an invitation for the at first sight premiere? oh my god! val kilmer did not wear this in batman! he wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
let me see that! (grabs the invitation and reads it.) oh man!
the only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (hands him the jacket and walks away.)
(entering) hey! uh, monica? chandler? can i talk to you guys for a second?
all right that is it, i give up! whatever you want you can have it! you want to sing a song? you want to do a dance? you want your mom stand at the alter and scream racial slurs? i do not care!
no! no, i-i just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. they are so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
(defeated) oh.
well, you are welcome. and tell them we are really glad they are coming.
okay. i will. ohh! check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) huh? i wear it like this when i marry you guys, and then this (he tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.
it happened! i am telling you it happened!
what?! wait a minute! no wait a minute! (she does so.) okay? look, that night was the one wild thing i have ever done in my entire life, and I am not going to let you take that away from me! okay, so if you do not remember that, maybe you will remember this! (she grabs melissa and kisses her on the lips.)
(shocked) what?
(moving away) whoa! whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! whoa! whoa!
(moves away again) i-i-i-I am just…I am just a good kisser!
I am sorry!
wow! i mean i had no idea that that was going to…
what the hell was that?!
i just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
and?
I have had better.
(yelling from the changing room) all right! i found one that fits!
well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. (chandler enters.) aww, look at you all handsome!
whose is it?
oh does it matter?! all that matters is that you look so handsome.
whose is it?
i do not want to say.
oh, come on! i do not care! come on! whose is it?
diane keeton.
do you realize that four weeks from today we are getting married? four weeks baby!! four weeks!!!
do you realize you get louder each week?
there is still so much to do. have you written your vows yet?
i figured I would buy those. pat, I would like to buy a vow. (laughs)
sweetie, you know i have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
right. so uh, have you written yours yet?
no! but i know exactly what I am going to say.
do you happen to know what I am going to say?
(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) let us just do it right now. okay? it will not be hard. just say what is in your heart. (she goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)
(watching in her) (in his head) look at her go! she must love me more than i love her! what is wrong with me? ooh, do not open that door.
(writing) monica, there are no words… (to joey and ross) there are no words! this should not be this hard!
all right, uh… (to ross) oh hey, you have done this before ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
well with carol, i promised never to love another woman until the day i die. she made no such promise.
I am so pathetic! monica knows what she wants to say! you should have seen her. writing, writing, writing!
monica what?
what?!
what is the emergency?!
you have to help me! I am supposed to be writing my vows and all i have is this! (shows them what she is been working on.)
well, i like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
thank you.
yeah, except your breasts look kind of small. (points.)
those are my eyes! those are my breasts. (points.)
oh! yeah! (monica glares at her.)
well, why do not you just start with something simple. like umm, monica from the moment i met you, i knew i loved you.
yeah, I am not sure i can do that.
...everyone, this is chandler!
(seeing her) okay.
okay. okay. okay. umm, maybe you can start with, "chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew i wanted more."
all right, there is a nuclear holocaust, I am the last man on earth. would you go out with me?
ennnh.
ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
well maybe you do not talk about your feelings back then. maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he is taught you. like… (they all try to think about one example and do not succeed.) or all the things you taught him.
now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (she starts labelling them) you got one, two three, four (chandler is shocked to find out there is more than three), five, six, and seven!
(shocked) there are seven?! (points to one) that is one?
it is kind of an important one!
oh, y’know-y’know what, i was looking at it upside down.
well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (she realises what that could have meant.)
all right. umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (they both lean back on the couch satisfied.)
oh, i got it! how about saying something like, "monica…
(writing) monica…
"…when i look back over our time together…"
(writes what joey said and waits for him to go on) yeah?
well, i can not do everything! look back over your time together.
oh, look, twins. hi, guys. oh, cute, cute.
no fair. i do not even have one. how come they get two?
you will get one.
oh yeah? when?
all right. I will tell you what. when we are 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?
why will not i be married when I am 40?
oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
ok, hypothetically, why will not i be married when I am 40?
no, no, no.
what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
(trapped) uh, uh.
well?
dear god! this parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
(screaming) I am getting married today!! ahh, whoo-hoo!!(he runs back out the door.)
(comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) do you think he knew i was here? (chandler quickly looks at monica not knowing what to say.)
nice try.
wait, wait, wait! (she puts a shriner's hat on the turkey.)
look, monica…
look! (she puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
this is not going to work.
i bet this will work! (she starts dancing and chandler cracks up.)
you are so great! i love you!
what?
nothing! i said, i said "you are so great" and then i just, i just stopped talking!
you said you loved me! i can not believe this!
no i did not!
yes, you did!
no i did not!
you love me!
no i do not! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
 y’know i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here?
then all your stuff would be here.
well, what if all my stuff was here?
then you would be going back and forth all the time, i mean it does not make any sense.
okay. what if we lived together and you understand what I am saying?
you wanted it to be a surprise.
oh my god.
chandler… in all my life… i never thought i would be so lucky. (starting to cry.) as to…fall in love with my best…my best… there is a reason why girls do not do this!
okay! (he joins her on one knee) okay! okay! I will do it!  oh god, i thought… (starting to cry, pauses) wait a minute, i-i can do this. (pause) i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you, (pause) you make me happier than i ever thought i could be. (starting to cry again.) and if you will let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (pause as he gets out the ring.) monica, will you marry me?
yes.
(yelling through the door) can we come it yet?! we are dying out here!
come in! come in! (joey, rachel, and phoebe burst through the door.) we are engaged!!!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey, what have you guys been up to?
oh, we were helping chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
how is "monica, i love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
how is monica coming along with her vows?
well let us just say its she is lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘because she is not so good at the writing.
i can not believe in four weeks they are going to be married!
well let us just hope it works. y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
phoebe that is not true.
yeah, you are right. how is the mrs.?
i can not believe they have been together for three years.
(shocked) has it been that long?!
believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
hey, it is me! I am comin' in!
I have had a very long, hard day.
ahh, I am going to go get some chicken. want some?
ahh, no thanks. no chicken, bye-bye then.
okay.
are you okay? I am so sorry, he would not leave. he kept asking me about chicken.
chicken? i could eat some chicken.
hey joe!
yeah, can i get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a coke—(yelps in pain as monica grabs him underwater)—diet coke.
i do not know why they did not just tell us.
i know! i mean it is not like we were not cool about it.
(to chandler) you?! (to monica) and-and you?!
yes, but you cannot tell anyone! no one knows!
how?! when?!
it happened in london.
in london!!!
the reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a big deal out of it.
but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!
no-no-no-no-no! you can not!
please? please?! we just do not want to deal with telling everyone, okay? just promise you will not tell.
all right! man, this is unbelievable!
(on phone) i can not wait to be with you!  I will just tell rachel I am going to be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
(on phone) laundry. huh. is that my new nickname? (rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
(on phone) awww, y'know what your nickname is, mr. big…
arghh!! (she quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)
(looking out the window) oh, look! there is monica and chandler! (starts yelling.) hey! hey, you guys! hey! (chandler and monica start taking each other's clothes off.) ohh!! ohh! ahh-ahhh!!
what?!
(screaming) ahhh!! chandler and monica!! chandler and monica!!
oh my god!
chandler and monica!!!!
oh my god!!!
oh!! my eyes!!! my eyes!!!!
phoebe!! phoebe!! it is okay!! it is okay!!
no! they are doing it!!!
i know!! i know!! i know!
you know?!!!
yes, i know! and joey knows! but ross does not know so you have to stop screaming!!
(entering) what is going on?
(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) hi!! hi!
what?! what?!
nothing! oh god, we are just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
actually, it looks really good. (turns towards the window and now phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
(screaming incoherently.) get in here!!! (motions to join her and rachel.)
okay, so now they know that you know and they do not know that rachel knows?
yes, but y'know what? it does not matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
all right honey, we would better go if we want to catch that movie.
bye!
bye chandler! (she walks up to him.) (quietly.) i miss you already. (she pinches his butt.)
(after they have left) okay, did you see that?! with the inappropriate and the pinching!!
actually, i did!
okay, so now do you believe that she is attracted to me?
ohhh, oh my god! oh my god! she knows about us!
phoebe knows about us!
well i did not tell them!
them?! who is them?
uhhh, phoebe and joey.
joey!
and rachel. i would have told you but they made me promise not to tell!
oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! but see they do not know that we know that they know! so…
ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
I will have to get back to you on that. okay, bye! (hangs up.) oh my god! he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
are you kidding?!
no!
i can not believe he would do that to mon—whoa! (she stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at joey. joey is avoiding her eyes.) joey, do they know that we know?
no.
joey!
they know you know.
ugh, i knew it! oh i cannot believe those two!
god, they thought they can mess with us! they are trying to mess with us?! they do not know that we know they know we know! (joey just shakes his head.) joey, you can not say anything!
i could not even if i wanted too.
listen, this is totally getting out of hand! okay? she wants me to put lotion on her!
she is bluffing!
look, she is not backing down! she went like this! (he does a little mimic of her dance.)
he is not backing down. he went to get lotion.
(entering the hall) oh man! are not you guys done yet?!
joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner phoebe breaks chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
ooh!
okay!
i like that! (to phoebe) oh, okay! show him your bra! he is afraid of bras! can not work  them! (he swiftly rips open the front of phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
joey! (examining the dress.) wow, you did not rip off any buttons.
it is not my first time.
you go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
okay, give me a second! (pause) did you clean up in here?
of course.
oh, you are-you are going?
umm, not without you, lover. (she slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) so, this is my bra.
(swallowing hard) it is very, very nice. well, come here. I am very happy were going to have all the sex.
you should be. I am very bendy. (pause) I am going to kiss you now.
not if i kiss you first.
ooh.
well, i guess there is nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
here it comes. our first kiss.
okay! okay! okay! you win! you win!! i can not have sex with ya!
and why not?!
because I am in love with monica!!
you are-you are what?!
love her! that is right, i…love…her!!! i love her!! (they walk together and hug.) i love you, monica.
i love you too chandler. (they kiss.)
i just—i thought you guys were doing it, i did not know you were in love!
 so that is it! it is over! everybody knows!
well actually, ross does not.
yes, and we would appreciate it if no one told him yet.
(he notices something through the window.) no! no! wh… what are you doing?!! (dr. ledbetter is slowly backing away.) get off my sister!!!!!!!!!!!!!
y’know, you are friend’s getting married, it is got to change things.
you really think it would be that different?
how could it not be? i mean pretty soon they are going to be having kids, and then they are just going to be hanging out with other couples who have kids. and then maybe they are going to have to leave the city to be near a volvo dealership.
well, things change.
i do not want them to move to a volvo dealership!
it will be okay joe.
I am sorry, i just…i like things the way they are.
hey, who is this little naked guy?
that little naked guy would be me.
aww, look at the little thing.
yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. can we be grown-ups now?
who are those people?
got me.
oh, that is nana, right there in the middle. (reads the back) 'me and the gang at java joe's'.
wow, monica, you look just like your grandmother. how old was she there?
let us see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
looks like a fun gang. (they all look at each other and smile)
ooh, look-look-look-look-look! i got monica naked!
(looking) nono, that would be me again.
hey, you guys!
hey.
hey.
what is going on?
well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.
yeah, you can get a volvo. if that is what you really want.
oh that is so sweet.
so we both finished our vows.
oh!
hey!
oh, can we read them?
yeah, i do not hear chandler’s and he does not hear mine.
okay.
okay.
(to monica) oh, that is beautiful.
(to chandler) (laughing) funny one! that is good!
(to monica) monica, will-will you marry me?
what? i do not get it.
(to chandler) oh man, this is hilarious.
chandler!!
do not worry honey, we will make yours funnier.
okay, what do you guys think?
(quietly) dude!
(starting to cry) i have never known love like this.
you really like it?
dude! how-how did you write this?
i stole monica’s and changed the name.
you can not do that!
if he goes first he can!
hey!
hey!
hey uh mon, i saw the porsche parked out front, can i get the keys? thought I would take that bad boy out for a little spin.
wait a minute! (to monica) you let ross drive the porsche and when i ask you, you say you are the only one who is allowed to drive it.
yeah, well he is my brother! and plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
it is a car monica! not a rocket ship!
whatever ross! just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you are done.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey!
saw the porsche out there mon, lookin’ good. when do i get to take that baby out again?
(shocked) you let joey drive it?!
I have never driven it! okay? not once! okay once. okay, i drive it all the time.
nice work everybody! so much for the y’know, "you can drive it, but do not tell rachel" plan!
wow! i can not believe you lied to me.
okay, i can fix this! okay monica, rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. (rachel glares at her.)
great! well rachel, the reason why i will not let you drive the porsche is because you are a terrible driver. there! that was not about the wedding.
look rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the porsche I will be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
yeah, you got a couple hours?
whew! that was a brisk ride!
take the top down did ya?
only way to fly.
come on ross give me the keys! monica does not know what she is talking about! i am an excellent driver!
you are fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver.
well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.
did you see the look that girl just gave me? huh? she must have seen me cruising in the bad boy.
i think she is checking out your beehive ross.
what?! (checks his hair.) give-give me a brush.
give me the keys!
no way!
well no brush!
fine! y’know what? it does not matter, because, if i remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
(to the woman) alimony. (runs outside.)
chandler, we still have not gotten an rsvp from your dad.
oh! right. umm, maybe that is because i did not send him an invitation.
chandler! he is your father; he should be at the wedding.
i do not even know the man. okay? we are not the close. i have not seen him in years.
well what are you going to do when he finds out he was not even asked?!
well he does not have to know! it is not like we run in the same circles. i hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in vegas.
ooh, i think i want to trade circles.
trust me, you do not want him there either. okay? nobody is going to be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
so what! as long as he is not wearing a white dress and a veil i do not care.
okay, i think i need to do some shopping. (gets up and leaves.)
ahhh! (gets in.) ooh, nice!
my god!
what do you think you are doing?!
just washing the windshield. (she turns on the wipers forcing ross off of the hood.)
there is no way i am letting you drive this car! so why do not you just hand over the keys?
oh.
no ah-ah-ah! do not start this car! (she starts the car.) okay! okay! i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (he looks for the twenty rachel stole and does not find it.)
look ross, if you are so freaked out, just get in the car!
with you?! yeah right!
all right. (she starts off.)
(grabbing the car) okay! okay! okay! (he gets in, but into the back seat.)
what are you doing?! get in the front!
in the death seat?!!
oh my…
hey!
hey sweetie!
yeah! sure! ooh, i left my purse up at monica’s. I will be right back. (she goes to get it.)
what? (he leans in to kiss her.) oh. (they kiss and phoebe pauses.) ooh. (pause) whoa! that one kept going. (exits.)
so! you and phoebe huh? how long have you been going out?
wow! maybe uh, maybe you and i ought to get to know each other a little better.
so uh, what is your name?
joey. (they shake hands.) hey jake, do you like the knicks?
me too! there is a game on tuesday do you want to go?
here! (she sets a bag down in front of him.)
what is this?
it is your suitcase. we are going to las vegas.
are you serious?! i mean like eloping?! no more stupid wedding stuff?! no more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—think of the money we will save!! (monica just looks at him.) we are not eloping. i love the flowers. can our wedding be bigger please?
we are going to las vegas to see your dad. it is time you two talked, and i want to get to know my father-in-law.
y’know we already went over this and i won!
no you did not. oh and honey just so you know, now that you are marrying me, you do not get to win anymore.
look forget it okay? i do not want to go. i do not want to see him. i do not want to.
chandler, look i-i know that your dad embarrassed you. i know…
no-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you would have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through. when i was in high school, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet. y’know it is hard enough to be fourteen. you are skinny. you are wearing speedoes—that your mom promised that you would grow into! and you look up into the stands and there is your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda. we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! okay? that is a, that is a pretty great dad.
he had sex with mr. girabaldi!
who is mr. girabaldi?
does it matter?!
chandler, you are not fourteen anymore. okay? maybe it is time that you let that stuff go. if your father’s not at your wedding…you are going to regret it for the rest of your life.
yeah of-okay, but I am just doing this for you.
yes!
so i really never get to win anymore?
how much did ever really win before?
pheebs!
hey!
listen, you know how uh, when you are wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear?
yeah!
well, when jake did it i saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!
i know. they were mine.
oh. (laughs.) no! no wait, that is weird!
no, it is not! we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on.
that is weird!
I am wearing his briefs right now.
that is…kind of hot.
i think so too. and that little flap? great for holding my lipstick.
yeah, i would not know about that.
and! y’know what jake says? that women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
yeah well next thing you know, he will be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
there is nothing wrong with jake! okay? he is all man! I am thinking even more than you.
oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
I am just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! i do not think you could ever do that.
hey! i am secure with my masculinity.
okay whatever.
you have seen my huge stack of porn right? (phoebe nods.)
god. i forgot how much i love driving. i have got to get my license renewed.
(shocked) you do not have a valid driver’s license—okay that is it! pull over right now!
oh ross you are so tense! you just got to relax okay? just need to relax all right? just need to relax… (she takes her hands off of the wheel.)
(grabbing the wheel) what-what are you doing?! are you—okay that is not funny! just stop horsing around!
i am not horsing around okay? i am porsching around.
uh-oh. (she starts to pull over.)
okay, stay calm. nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
really? you think so?
i was talking to myself! you are going down!
uh oh yeah, she did. uh, he did. (to chandler) she? (to the waiter) I am-I am sorry I am new. i do not…
yeah, i just ordered a beer! (pounds the table.)
i still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
no! no! i do not want him to know we are yet! I am not sure I am ready for that. and besides he is not going to be too happy to see me either.
why not?!
i do not know if I have told you this, but he is kind of tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
what?!
yeah, he is made phone calls, written letters, he even came to new york, but i always said i was too busy to see him. y’know it is all very cats in the cradle—i do not want to get into it. (the show starts.) here we go.
and there is daddy!
okay. switch places with me! switch places with me! come on! I will go under, you go over!
yeah, I will get right on that.
oh come on ross!! (she tries to switch places with him and goes under his leg.)
no rach! come on! no-no! yeah, I am sure we will not get arrested for this.
(sexily) hi officer, was i going a little too fast?
oh my god.
oh yes, absolutely! y’know, it is weird uh, but i had a dream last night where i was stopped by a policeman. and then he uh…well i probably should not tell you the rest.
(handing it to him) yes. here you go officer uh, handsome.
oops sorry, my mistake.
dear lord!!
here it comes.
really?! you think so? y’know, i had just rolled out of bed.
well she should, it was taken ten years ago!
y’know you are-you are probably wondering about the old date on there.
yeah.
i bet you are a gemini.
taurus?
virgo?
sagittarius?
i knew it! i knew it, ahh….
yeah?
i will not speed.
i promise.
yeah!
oh well…
i can handle the stick!!
that can not be your father.
believe me, I have been saying that for years. oh my god!
what?
that is mr. girabaldi playing the piano.
he is coming into the audience. he is coming into the audience.
relax! you will be fine. (chandler exhales and turns off the table light.) oh much better. you are invisible now.
it can not happen like this. okay? I will meet you back at the hotel.
can we have our drinks please?! waiter—uh, tress!
hey pheebs! (he sits down next to her.)
hey!
check it out. (he turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows phoebe that he is got panties on.) how much of a man am i?!
wow! nice! manly and also kind of a slut.
y’know, I am beginning to see what jake was talking about.
uh-huh.
the silk? feels really good!
huh.
yeah! and-and things are not as…smashed down as i thought they were going to be.
that is great joe!
yeah! and you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!
uh-huh.
bikini, french cut, thong! and-and the fabrics! you have got cotton, silk, lace! and y’know what I have always wondered about?
hmm?
pantyhose! y’know? they way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here… (he mimed that and stops when he realized he went to far.) i should go take these off should not i?
i think it is important that you do.
(resigning himself to his fate) chandler. (he quickly sits down.)
oh, they are a hoot.
I am-I am monica.
new york.
actually monica and i are engaged.
(looks at chandler) in…in two weeks.
wait! wait! we would really love it if you could be there.
i know it would make me happy, madam.
(to chandler) you okay?
yeah. thanks for making me do this.
(to monica) when i was growing up i…played the one on the far left.
remind me to introduce you to someone!
who?
fourth gear!!
what?! what does he want?! i was not doing anything!
well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two of the clock position.
maybe it is uh sergeant sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! (they pull over.)
it is a different guy!
good evening officer.
ah no. i do not, but it could not have been more than sixty.
i mean you are not going to give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
y’know of-officer i uh…i had the weirdest dream last night…
oh my god!
(laughs) you do not-you do not want to hear about my dream officer…pretty?
(pause) you have a son!
i know. i know.
feel better?
yeah! much! listen uh, not that I am y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but i think i need to hook up with a woman like right now.
yeah, i understand.
yeah! okay! (he notices a beautiful woman sitting behind the couch and goes to talk to her.) hey! hi!
y’know, you look familiar. do i know you from somewhere?
oh! maybe it is because I am on television. I am an actor on days of our lives.
yeah.
hm-mmm.
oh, let me get this. (he takes out his wallet, but the panties come with it. the woman and waitress are shocked.) (realizing) (to the woman) these are for you.
do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
why?
just want to check my horoscope, see if it was right.
oh my god. (grabs phoebe and turns her away) phoebe. do not look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
where? (turns to face him) ooh, come to momma.
he is coming. be cool, be cool, be cool.
we should do something. whistle.
we are not going to whistle.
come on, do it.
no!
do it!
no!
do it do it do it!
(shouts to the guy) woo-woo!
i can not believe you did that!
why did i 'woo-hoo'? i mean, what was i hoping would happen? that-that he would turn round and say 'i love that sound, i must have you now'?
i just wish there was something we could do. (bends down and talks to him) hello. hello, coma guy. get up, you girl scout! up! up! up!
phoebe, what are you doing?
maybe nobody's tried this.
i wish we at least knew his name... look at that face. i mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. i bet he is a lawyer.
yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? that means he is artistic.
okay, he is a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. and- he can dance!
oh! and, he is the kind of guy who, when you are talking, he is listening, y'know, and not saying 'yeah, i understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
i wish all guys could be like him.
i know.
are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
he does not have anyone.
yeah, we-we feel kind of responsible.
i can not believe you said woowoo. i do not even say woowoo.
oh, she is coming up! she is coming up! (turns on the tv)
y'know, we do not have to watch this. weekend at bernie's is on showtime, hbo, and cinemax.
no way, forget it.
c'mon, she is your mom!
exactly. weekend at bernie's! dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! no?
chandler, i got to tell you, i love your mom's books! i love her books! i cannot get on a plane without one! i mean, this is so cool!
yeah, well, you would not think it was cool if you are eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'mistress bitch.'
c'mon, chandler, i love your mom. i think she is a blast.
you can say that because she is not your mom.
oh, please...
oh, hi sweetie. (they kiss)
when did rigatoni get back from rome?
last night.
ah, so then his plane did not explode in a big ball of fire?... just a dream i had- but, phew.
hey hey hey! she is on!
your mom was arrested?
shhh, busy beaming with pride.
now why would she say that is embarrassing?
that is too much information!!
this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone.
...and then he burst into flames.
let us see. congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
what about glen? he could be a glen.
nah... not-not special enough.
ooh! how about agamemnon?
waaay too special.
please god do not let it be kung pow chicken.
well, i think you need to come out of your she will just a little.
(entering) what is this dive? only you could have picked this place.
i know i am.
yeah.
I am in.
uh, I am not really a shot drinking kind of guy.
hi! sorry- sorry we are late, we, uh, kind of just, y'know, lost track of time.
...but a man can change. (downs a shot)
anyone want me to appraise anything?
mrs. bing, i have to tell you, I have read everything you have ever written. no, i mean it! i mean, when i read euphoria at midnight, all i wanted to do was become a writer.
myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
yeah, I am fine, I am fine. (a woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)
nothing. nothing nothing nothing.
no. it is the one he is licking.
you are good.
the girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
when?
the guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
please.
right.
uh-oh...
uhhhh.... I will just pee in the street.
hey, is chandler here?
yeah.
okay, uh, about last night, um, chandler.. you did not tell... (joey shakes his head) okay, because I am thinking- we do not need to tell chandler, i mean, it was just a kiss, right? one kiss? no big deal? right?
right. no big deal.
okay.
in bizarro world!! you broke the code!
what code?
you do not kiss your friend's mom! sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
what are you guys doing out here?
uh.. uh.. well, joey and i had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. but, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
yeah, well, you do not have your racket.
no, no i do not, because it is being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
yeah, well you did not call and leave your grip size.
okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (goes back inside and shuts the door)
okay, I am scum, I am scum.
ross, how could you let this happen?
i do not know, god, i... well, it is not like she is a regular mom, y'know? she is, she is sexy, she is...
you do not think my mom's sexy?
well... not in the same way...
I will have you know that gloria tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? you think it is easy giving birth to seven children?
okay, i think we are getting into a weird area here...
hey.
hey.
what are you guys doing out here?
well, not playing raquetball!
he forgot to leave his grip size!
he did not get the goggles!
well,sounds like you two have issues.
goodbye, baby.
do they wait for me to do this?
so are you going to tell him?
why would i tell him?
how about because if you do not, his mother might.
oh...
(entering) what are you guys doing here?
uhhhh.... he is not even wearing a jockstrap!
...what did i ask?
hi.
hi.
what are you doing here?
nothing, i just thought I would stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that i.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I am not really here. just thought I would drop these off...on the way.. my way... do you come here a lot? without me?
no. (monica brushes coma guy's hair in the other direction) no! no! ...so, um, do you think he is doing any better than he was this morning?
how would i know? i-i was not here.
really? not even to, um, change his pajamas?! (whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)
oh my god.
you are my friend. i-i had to tell you.
i can not believe it. paolo kissed my mom?
yeah, um, i do not know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he is drun..uh... (he has caught sight of joey scowling at him) i can not do this, i did it, it was me, I am sorry, i kissed your mom.
what?
i was really upset about rachel and paolo, and i think i had too much tequila, and nora- um, mrs. mom- your bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- but nothing happened, nothing- ask joey, joey, uh, came in-
(to joey) you knew about this?
uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
i spent the entire day with you, why did not you tell me?!
hey, hey, hey, you are lucky i caught them when i did, or else who knows what would have happened.
thanks, man, big help.
(to ross) i can not believe this! what the hell were you thinking?
i was not- i mean, i-
y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you.
i know-
i can not believe you did this. (walks toward the door)
chandler-
me neither, y'know what-
I am still mad at you for not telling me.
what are you mad at me for?!
chandler-
you got to let me slam the door! (leaves; slams the door)
(shouting after him) chandler, i did not kiss her, he did! (to ross) see what happens when you break the code?
joey-
ah! (points to door) huh? (leaves and slams the door)
hey.
hey.
(reading) 'a woman undone, by rachel karen green'.
yeah. thought I would give it a shot. I am still on the first chapter. now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
(reads) yeah, I would say so. and there is no 'j' in 'engorged'.
(walks up with her guitar) hey rach.
hey.
hello.
hello.
going to the hospital tonight?
no, you?
no, you?
you just asked me.
okay, maybe it was a trick question. (plays a few chords) um, rachel can we do this now?
okay. (writes a little more) i am so hot!
(to ross, on the couch) now, here is a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. now you tell me she is not a knockout.
i cannot believe we are having this conversation.
c'mon! just try to picture her not pregnant, that is all.
(into microphone) central perk is proud to present miss phoebe buffay.
thanks. hi, um, 'kay. I would like to start with a song that is about a man that i recently met, who is, um, come to be very important to me. (monica gives her a look) 'kay. (sung:)
(into mike) okay, that was phoebe buffay, everybody. woo!
what was that?
oh, uh, phoebe just started a...
yeah, i believe i was talking to joey, alright there, mother-kisser? (goes to the counter)
(laughing) mother-kisser... (sees ross's look) I will shut up.
chandler, can i just say something? i-i know you are still mad at me, i just want to say that there were two people there that night. okay? two sets of lips.
yes, well, i expect this from her. okay? she is always been a freudian nightmare.
okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why do not you say something?
because it is complicated, it is complex- hey, you kissed my mom!
(to the rest of central perk) we are rehearsing a greek play.
that is very funny. we done now?
no! okay, you mean, you are not going to talk to her, you are not going to tell her how you feel?
that would be no. look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom does not mean you know her. alright? trust me, you can not talk to her.
okay, 'you' can not, or (points to chandler) you can not? (chandler grabs his finger) okay, that is my finger. (chandler twists it and ross goes down on one knee) that is, that is my knee. (to central perk) still doing the play. aaah!
alright, whadyou do with him?
oh! you are awake!
look at you! how, how do you feel?
you look good!
oh, sorry.
I am phoebe buffay.
I am monica geller. I have been taking care of you.
well, we both have.
well, actually it is just from me.
i got you the foot massager.
you know who shaved you? that was me.
i read to you.
i sang. (to monica) hah!
oh, my pleasure.
you are welcome.
what, that is it?
"see you around?"
oh, i do not know. maybe, um, "that was nice?" admit something to me? "I will call you?"
i do not think you mean that.
this is so typical. y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. and then- we just get nothing back! and then one day, y'know, it is just, you wake up, and "see you around!" let us go, phoebe.
y'know what? we thought you were different. but i guess it was just the coma.
no, just knowing you are going to be there is enough.
you kissed my best ross! ...or something to that effect.
really stupid.
yeah. no. no...
ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
shh. he did it. he told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
you are kidding.
no, no. he said "when are you going to grow up and start being a mom?"
wow!
then she came back with "the question is, when are you going to grow up and realise i have a bomb?"
'kay, wait a minute, are you sure she did not say "when are you going to grow up and realise i am your mom?"
that makes more sense.
so, what is going on now?
i dunno, I have been standing here spelling it out for you! (goes back to the door) i do not hear anything. oh, wait, wait, wait. (looks through the spyhole)
whaddya see?
hard to tell, they are so tiny and upside-down. wait, wait. they are walking away... they are walking away... no, no they are not, they are coming right at us! run! run!
yeah, okay.
nice save.
(very politely) mrs. bing.
hey.
you mean that?
yeah, why not. (they shake hands) so i told her.
yeah? how did it go?
awful. awful. couldn'ta gone worse.
well, howdya feel?
pretty good! i told her.
well, see? so, maybe it was not such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? huh? (wags his finger at chandler, then puts it down) but.. we do not have to go down that road.
okay. now this is just the first chapter, and i want your absolute honest opinion. oh, oh, and on page two, he is not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
what is a 'niffle'?
you usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
alright, alright, so I am not a great typist...
wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? tell ya, you do not want to be around when he starts writing with those!
alright, that is it! give it back! that is it!
come on joey!!!
rach, i told you everything i knew last night! look, it is not that big of a deal, so monica and chandler are doing it.
i can not believe you would say that!
sorry. monica and chandler are making love.
no! i mean come on! this is a huge deal! (she sits next to him on the couch.) fine i want—i need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?
(thinks) i do not know.
is he romantic with her?
i do not know.
are they in love?
(thinks) i do not know.
you do not know anything.
ohh, i know one thing!
what?
they did it right there on the couch.
hey ross!
hey!
(disinterested) hey-yeah. (he hurries up to the counter.) hey gunther, can i have a scone please? (to the gang.) want to hear some good news? someone i know is getting married! yeah! and weddings are happy occasions! oh, by-the-by it is my ex-wife emily!
sorry man.
oh, thanks gunther. (he takes it, hands the plate it is on to rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) stupid british snack food!!!!!!!
did they teach you that in your anger management class?
hey, you know what might help you deal with it? think of it this way, you and emily are in the past and you can not be mad about the past. so are you still mad about the louisiana purchase?
pheebs, i do not think anyone's mad about that.
exactly! because it is in the past!
(eyeing the flattened scone) anybody going to eat that?
look at us all dressed up for the big office party! by the way, what are we celebrating?
oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the christmas party.
i think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. we do not have to hide.
i know, i can do this. (he takes her hand.)
ooh, and i can do this. (she kisses him on the cheek.)
i asked myself that very question, sir. uh, (points to monica) this is monica. (points to his boss.) this is my boss, doug. doug this is monica.
hi, nice to meet you!
no, sir.
what was that?
what?
that noise you just made?
oh, that was my work laugh.
really? your work laugh?
oh, believe me, to survive this party, you are going to have to come up with one too.
all right, check me out.
okay.
hey! everybody at work loved you last night!
really?
and! they like me more just because i was with ya! i think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met joey. and doug wants us to play tennis with them. he is never even talked to me outside of work. except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club. (she glares at him.) strip church. anyway, I am going to go try and find a racquet.
hey, i thought you already had one.
oh i used too, but then joey thought it would be fun to go to central park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks. (he starts to leave and stops an entering rachel.) hey rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
oh umm, y'know i lent it to joey and i never actually got it back.
okay, good luck with that. (exits.)
(to monica) hey!
hi!
what is up?!
what are you doing here? i thought you had to do inventory all day.
well yeah, i do, but i decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend monica. y'know i-i feel that we do not talk anymore. how are you? what is new with you?
uhh, not much. uh, work's good.
oh y'know what, we do not have to talk about work. we can talk about anything!
okay. umm…
hey! y'know what? let us talk about relationships!
okay, what is going on with you?
nothing! you go!
well, i-i—there was this guy at the bank that i thought was cute umm, but i do not anymore.
wow that is uh, juicy. umm, (checks watch) y'know what though mon, i actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there is just not anything else?
yes, I am sure! rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
no! (gets up to leave.) (under her breath.) if there was i would not tell you.
okay, then what happened?
(gasps) ohh. uh-huh. uh-huh. (the chick clucks.) you will get your turn!
(entering from the bathroom) hey pheebs, what is going on?
nothing! (picks up and sets the chick down on the floor.) (to the chick.) this is not over!
no! no! no!
what?!
i was up all night writing this really nasty letter to emily! it was perfect and now it is all covered in-in… (the duck quacks.) actually, thanks!
(entering from his room) all right! everybody ready to go to the movies?
uh actually, i think I am going to skip it.
really?
yeah, I am going to stay and read my book. i just want to be alone right now.
oh. are you sure you do not want to come? tom hanks, meg ryan, they get mail and stuff.
that is okay, joe.
all right, let us go pheebs.
(licks the envelope and encounters a foreign substance on the glue.) oh god!
game!
am i on fire today or what?! those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
okay, easy martina. i think we should let them win the next game.
I am sorry, i do not understand what you just said.
let them win one.
are you crazy?! we own those two! i mean look at 'um, he can not breath and she is popping pills.
you are not even giving them a chance!
they have racquets do not they?!
oh yes, sir! put me out of my misery. are you sure you never played pro? (does his work laugh.) (to monica) please let them win!
I will take it down to 95% but that is the best i can do.
oopsey, missed it!
i got it! (she hits a forehand smash that bounces right in between doug and kara and scores a point.)
i got it!!
long! (gives monica the work laugh.)
i can not believe you let them win!
yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
i was frustrated.
it was my racquet.
i was frustrated with you!
if we had not lost the game they never would have invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
y'know what really bothers me? is—it is how-how different you act around them! i mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I will see you around, bing!" "not if i see you first, doug!" (mocks the fake laugh.) i got to tell you, i do not like work chandler. okay? the guy's a suck-up.
okay y'know what, because you said that, I am not putting out tonight.
I am telling you, something is wrong! my brother does not stay out all night.
maybe we should check the trash chute.
ross could not fit down the trash chute.
that is right, he almost could. which is exactly how i got stuck there.
hey!
there he is!
oh my god! (she goes to hug him, stops short, and hits him on the shoulder.) where the hell have you been?!!
just, y'know out.
ohh, out, oh god, i do not know why we did not think to check there!
what were you doing?
i uh, went to a bar. and then i just uh, just walked around for a while.
you walked around all night in the city by yourself?
(snaps his fingers) he hooked up! he hooked up with someone.
look, i do not have to answer your questions! okay? I am a big boy, i can do whatever i want!
he hooked up!! tell us about her!
yeah! no that is what i was thinking.
oh, nobody's judging you. (they all turn and look at ross.)
okay, look, i-i know what you guys are going to say…
you two will have very hairy children.
okay, i did not know you would say that.
ross! janice?!
all right, hold on! hold on. hold on. this is ross, okay? he is our friend. he obviously went crazy. he obviously lost his mind.
look, i did not lose my mind! okay, janice and i have a lot in common! we have-we have both been divorced. we-we both have kids.
so are you actually going to see her again?
phoebe! do not put ideas in his head!
i am going to see her again.
damnit phoebe!!
(entering) okay, i have to tell you something that i have never admitted during our entire friendship! but, when we were in high school i made out with james farrell even when i knew that you liked him! wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! okay, you go!
my turn? what-what are you talking about?
ugh, monica, i know about you and chandler.
what?!
i overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I will just tell rachel that I am doing laundry for a couple of hours." and he said, "laundry? is that my new nickname?" and you said, "no! you know what your nickname is, mr. big."
well. sounds like you are writing yourself a little play there rach. wow! let me know how that one turns out.
well, i would not know because i got so freaked out that i hung up the phone.
well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him mr. big…(thinks)…ot.
what?!
mr. bigot. he tells the most racist jokes.
all right. so you are telling me that there is nothing going on between you and chandler.
me and chandler?! (does her fake laugh.)
all right, put your 20 bucks down. first one to find the tasty treat wins. okay?
uh-hmm.
all right. let us get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (he removes the waste bucket that is over the duck and the laundry basket that is over the chicken.) and they are off! (he puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
get your foot off my contestant! judge!
judge rules, no violation.
ohhh.
(entering) hey guys!
hey!
yeah!
y'know what? it sounds so weird to say this but, i just had a great day with janice!
what?!
are you serious?!
yeah! i opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that is been happening to me. i mean i talked for hours. (joey has lost interest and is watching the race again.) it is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
you do not need janice for that, you have got us. we…
and the duck gets the nutter-butter!
(turning from ross.) no!! hey-hey that is not a nutter-butter, that is just an old wonton!
judge rules, nutter-butter.
ohh, tough call.
yeah.
oh, none for me. thanks.
just a little bit of sugar.
(to chandler) how does that laugh not give you a headache?
oh, you get used to it.
y'know, i-i-i do not think that i can. so if you do not mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
so i laugh at my boss's jokes, what is the big deal?
I would rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when i can be hanging out with my boyfriend who i actually respect.
oh. (does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
what?
well, i-i just did not think it was funny sir.
well, i just…
(interrupting) honey, i just do not think that you understood the joke.
really?
yeah! i mean it was really funny, i-i just do not think you got it. you see kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? but-but what doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. you get it now honey?
i think i do! (they all laugh.) thank you, monica.
i thought you could use the help.
coffee in a fight! (does the laugh again.)
(entering) hey rach! hey, you mind if i read my comic books in here?
sure! why?
oh well, chandler and monica are over there and it is kind of hard to concentrate.
what?! she just called and said that she was going to be working late! she keeps lying to me! that is it! y'know what? I am just going to go over there and confront them right now!
(from his bedroom) all right, so you are telling me that i have to tell racist jokes now?!
sorry! I am just—I am not very good at this! I am a terrible liar and i hate having to lie to rachel!
but we are not ready to tell yet!
i know! it is just that…ever since high school rachel was the one person i told everything too. y'know? i miss that so much now. she is my best friend.
(entering) joey?! oh my god, rachel!
hey! hi!
wh-wh-what are you doing here? (she tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she is wearing men's boxers.]
well, i was actually—i-i came over here to-to borrow this lamp. to umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
okay great!
yeah!
great! umm, well what-what i was doing in chandler's room is that umm, i was cleaning it! in fact, he pays me to clean it!
oh! what a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
y'know when i said to you earlier that i was at work umm, I am at my new work.
that is good enough. right? (pause.) okay, well umm, I am going to go look at my books!
okay.
okay.
I will get back to my new job.
'kay. (pause.) congratulations on your new job. (she goes and hugs monica and is almost in tears.)
man, she is really gullible.
thanks!
are you sure? because i can stay out as late as you want. i told you how I am on sabbatical from work, right?
oh…
this is not what i ordered! man! can anything go right in my life?! first my marriage falls apart and then…
okay. sometimes i feel…
huh?
let-let me make sure I am hearing this right, you are ending this with me because I am too whiney? (janice makes an agreeing sound.) so you are saying, I have become so whiney that i annoy you, janice.
oh…my…god!!
i am now.
umm, hi.
dude, we got to talk.
okay.
i just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and i hope this is not too weird, but uh, i had uh, a thing with janice. (he laughs, his real laugh this time.) what you are-you are not mad?
why would i be mad?
well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. you do not uh, you do not fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they are related to.
(realizes what ross just said and the implications to him) i am mad! but you know what I am going to do? I am going to forgive you! because that is what friends do! they forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. well, but i want you to remember that i forgave you.
okay.
i also want you to remember that i let you live here rent free!
all right.
and, i want you to remember that i gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. no strings attached. now, if you can not remember that, i think we should write it down—let us write it down!
okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! now go-go-go! (phoebe enters) hey phoebe!
hey!
hey how was dinner?!
dinner was good!
okay!
I am just saying hi! now I am going to go!
okay!
(to him) oh, well hello there.
(to monica) i did not see this on the menu.
uh tim? this is phoebe. phoebe this is tim, my new sous chef.
oh, so you are monica’s boss?
oh! i sous stand.
hey tim? i need a calamari and a caesar salad. and umm, could you get me the pesto?
oh you…you made pesto?
would you say your pesto is the best-of?
all right, i still need a calamari and a caesar salad.
i made it myself.
well, it is no pesto.
all right, all right! let us just cut to the chase, okay? (to phoebe) you are single. (to tim) you are single. (to phoebe) he gets off work at eleven. (to tim) she will be waiting for your call. (to phoebe) I will give him your number if i can get one calamari and one caesar salad!! (everyone in the kitchen stops.) i did not yell. i am not putting a dollar in the jar.
you know me sir. oh ah, i do have a question for ya. do you know how i get around the office computer network so i can access the really good internet porn?
what is funny about that?
(running up) hey! sorry i kept you waiting so long.
hey that is okay. so, where do you want to go?
oh ah, i think you know where i want to go.
the hard rock caf�?
yeah!
again?!
yeah!!
I am telling you, i like the food!
you like the purple rain display! (a guy walks up.) hey bob.
did that guy just call you toby?
yeah, he thinks that is my name.
well, why do not you correct him?
oh it is been going on way to long now. y’know, i mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so i did not say anything. and then the next time he said, "hey toby, do you want a donut?" and i-i wanted a donut. and now it is five years later, the donut’s gone and I am still toby.
five years?! chandler you have to tell him!
no! that would be so awkward! look—besides, we work in different departments. he is on the sixth floor y’know? so he calls me toby once in a while. what is the big deal? it could be worse, it is not like he is calling me muriel. (chandler suddenly freezes into place.)
(laughs) muriel. wh-why would he call you muriel? (ross realizes something.) oh my god! chandler m bing? it is not just an m, your middle name is muriel!!
shh! it is a family name!
chandler muriel bing. boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
(to rachel) okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
well do not—what happened to jessica’s body?!
I am not telling, you will have to see it on tv!
you do not know do you?
no, could not care less.
hey you too!
what? you were not in it.
oh! (motions to joey’s co-star.)
oh sorry. uh-uh, kash?
this is my friend rachel. rachel, kash, kash, rachel.
hi.
well, joey probably thinks I will just embarrass him. y’know, he thinks I am some kind of a soap opera nut—which I am not! I am not. although i do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. (starts stroking his arm) and uh, and that your-your dog’s name is wally. well look at that, I am just stroking your arm.
(grabbing her) here we go! here we go! (starts to pull her away from kash.)
oh, we are leaving. bye kash.
say hi to wally.
ooh monica!
hi!
oh my god! i had the best time with tim last night. he is so sweet! oh, i can not wait to get sous-neath him.
i…i have to fire him.
but why?!
because he is terrible! okay, he is slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. and besides I have met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
but monica, he loves his job so much! can you just give him another chance? please?
(thinks about it) all right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
that is fair! thank you so much. thanks. oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
i paid to have this done.
love it!
hey!
hi!
oh you know uh kash, really liked you the other day. he said he thought you were charming.
i thought i was a complete idiot.
hey, I am with you. he even asked me if i thought you would go out with him.
oh! oh, i think I am going to throw up a little bit. what did you say?
i said no.
what?!
what? i…i just figured since you are pregnant you are not going to be seeing people.
okay joey, first of all kash ford is not people. second of all, what did he say when you told him i was pregnant?
i did not tell him. i did not know if you were telling people. this is back when i thought kash was still people.
good-good, do not tell him. do not tell him. just have him call me okay?
rach look, i really do not think that is such a great…
okay, you go do it! I will come back to that set! I will meet more actors! I will meet ‘them all!
hey bob.
if i see him, I will ask.
yeah!
we are on a semi-first name basis.
bob? ooh, working here with us? everyday? yeah, i do not know if he has what it takes.
but this is eleven. it is almost twice as hard up here.
i think it is best sir.
y’know what you should do, just toss ‘them in the shedder and claim you never got ‘them.
what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
hey!
hey. okay, i gave him another chance, but tim has got to go!
but…
no! no-no! he is totally incompetent. i called the chef who recommended him to me. he said, "ha-ha! gotcha!"
okay. okay, but you can not fire him today.
why not?!
because I am dumping him today.
what?! you said he was sweet!
he is sweet. he is too sweet. he calls me all the time. (mimicking him) "so did-did you get home from work okay?" "did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
just do not pick up your phone.
then he comes over! (mimicking him) "I am so worried about you." uck! be a man!
what? so now I am not allowed to fire him?
you can not fire him and dump him the same day, he will kill himself.
okay well then, I will fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
are you kidding?! another week with that sip, I will kill myself!
okay well, then we will both do it today and he will just have to deal with it!
okay. but the question is who is going to go first. ‘because whoever goes second is the bitch.
what do you mean?
come on! the boss that fires a guy that is just been dumped, bitch! and the woman who dumps a guy that is just been fired, blond bitch!
i wanted to do this days ago so i think i should go first.
all right, that makes sense. (starts towards the door.) ugh. but—screw you I am going first! (she grabs her purse and runs out.)
sure, what is up?
hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I am not drinking on this date tonight. "umm, I am a recovering alcoholic. I am a mormon," or "i got so hammered last night I am still a little drunk?"
(entering with a pizza and beer) hey!
hi!
hey!
so, what do you want to do tonight? there is a ukrainian film at the angelica that is supposed to be very powerful. interested?
no. no. but I will go see a normal person movie with ya.
rach? you want to come?
oh no, i can not. i got a date.
a date?
yeah. why? is that weird for you?
why no, it is the opposite of weird. it is-it is uh, regular. it is-it is uh, it is mundane. it is actually uh, a little dull.
it is no ukrainian film.
yeah—ooh! earrings! (goes into her room.)
a date?! she is-she is got a date?! with who?
i set her up with this actor on my show.
you set her up?!
no
joey what-what were you thinking?!
well, i was thinking that it would probably be okay because ross has not gone out with rachel in five years!
joey, I am not worried about her! I am worried about my baby! whoever she dates my baby dates! now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?
hey! I am an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I am not sure. i think they are taking the ferry out to some italian place on staten island.
a ferry? my baby is going on a ferry? do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
why do not they just jump out of an airplane?! huh?! that-that is a fun date! or burn each other with matches?! that is fun too! whew!!
hey kash. uh hey-hey this is ross. ross, this is kash.
hi. i-i hear you are going on a ferry tonight.
a bit of a daredevil are we?
(entering from her room) hey guys do you think this is too slutty—hi kash!
yeah! all right, I will see you guys later.
okay. have a great time you guys.
thank you.
yes it is too slutty! (joey slams the door before rachel could hear the entire sentence.)
hi.
it will be…in a minute. listen, tim you are a really great guy.
aw. (phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I am just—I am in a place in my life right now where i…i…
oh-oh no she does not! i know what that is. you can stay.
so what movie do you want to see—and not another one i have to read. okay? i get enough of that from books.
books?
all right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it is like enough!
well, i tell you what. why do not we uh, why do not we just stay here? let us not see a movie, we will just hang.
and just wait for rachel to come back from her date?
hey, if that is what you want to do I am not going to say no.
dude! what is going on?!
i just…i have to find out how it went.
why?
this guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
they go on one date and you are worried about them getting married?! he is not you!
i just—i-i can not believe she is-she is dating?!
well ross, what did you think she was going to do?
i do not know! i guess i just can not believe any of this is happening.
what do you mean?
it is just i always thought when i had another kid it would be different. now i-i love ben, but every time i have to drop him off at carol and susan’s, it is like—it breaks my heart a little. i mean I have always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. and we all read the paper together. y’know? maybe fight over the science section.
that is a nice picture. maybe you can still have that!
no! no i can not. i mean rachel’s out with some guy. my baby went with her. if anything that picture keeps moving further away.
hey, can i ask you something? in this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife rachel?
it used to be. now she does not really have a face. smokin’ body though.
good call. yeah. but, the face ross, the face is not rachel.
no but ahh! how much easier would it be if it were?
i know, but i do not think that is what she wants.
no, it is not what i want either. i mean i-i can not force myself to fall in love with her again now.
that is okay ross maybe you need a new picture. okay? it is not going to be what you thought, but no matter what there is going to be a brand new little baby, your baby. who cares what the picture looks like?
yeah.
hey, i tell you what. let us you and me go out and have some fun. huh? whatever you want. come on!
(checks his watch) we can still catch that ukrainian film.
no, i said fun!
hey bobby.
uhh yeah. yeah, it is (points down the hall) right, right down there. (when he has bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) right there, yeah. can i ask you why?
okay bob listen uhh, I am the reason you did not get the job up here.
bob!
well that puts me in a difficult position.
hey.
uh well that depends, how are things with phoebe?
oh my pleasure. okay, I am afraid I have got some bad news. (phoebe enters.) phoebe!
monica!
(simultaneously) you are fired!
(simultaneously) I am breaking up with you!
I am, I am breaking up with you.
you are fired.
I am sorry, I am just—I am…I am just not ready for a relationship right now.
yeah and-and I am sorry too. but, well i just—i like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.
oh that is good, the chemistry thing for us too.
tim wait!
umm, i think i spoke too quickly. there-there is a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
yeah.
okay.
and tim i just want to say, good luck here. (shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts monica.)

i made the mistake of telling him that i was pregnant.
ah, he did not uh, take it so well?
well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.
oh?
he got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "yeah, i hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
he sounds swell.
does not he?
hey, want to…want to a little cheering up?
yes.
sit down.
okay.

(thinks then gasps) chandler m. bing?
yeah-ha!
oh my god. (laughs)
I am sorry about your date.
oh it is all right. I am guess I am just done with the whole dating thing. it is one more thing in my life that is suddenly completely different. this is hard.
yeah i know. (pause) on the other hand in um, in about seven months you are going to have something that you are going to love more than any guy you have ever gone out with. just wait. wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. you have no idea.
thanks sweetie.
you want to, you want to grab some coffee?
oh no, i think I am going to go home and eat ten candy bars.
hey, i thought i cheered you up.
oh you did, there are twenty in here.

good night.
yeah?
oh hi!
wow! uh…how are you?
oh that is right. well uh, would you be interested in seeing a ukrainian film?
great! well umm…

(entering) bob. bob! bob!!! (he turns around) what the hell are you doing?!
joey.
(seeing the ring) oh my god. (pause) okay.
so uh…i guess we should…make it official huh?
uh… look rach…(ross enters.) hey ross is here! hey look! it is my good friend ross. hey ross.
hey joey. (to rachel) hey you.
hey you.
hey and look he brought flowers. thanks ross, but I am really more of a candy guy. (laughs.)
you are weird today. (he turns to rachel and joey puts the ring back.) (to rachel) listen i uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
uh yeah, actually i kind of need to talk to you too.
uh joey, can you give us just a minute?
no.
what?
oh, I am sorry. i meant no.
(entering with everyone else including mr. geller) hi! hey look who is here!
he pulled a quarter out of my ear!
hey, where is uh, where is mom?
oh, aunt liddy’s coming? that means we get five dollars each!
okay. wow.
uh dad, emma’s in the nursery. I will take you now. if you want, but (to rachel) i really want to talk to you.
i know, i still need to talk to you.
oh hey but, before you guys do that (to rachel) i need to talk to you, and ross, i need to talk to you.
(to monica) oh and i need to talk to you.
about what?
to see if know what these guys are talking about.
is not she beautiful?
what about ben?
(taking ross aside) have umm, have you thought anymore about you and rachel?
oh well yeah, actually i was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
yay! it is so exciting! wow, you could have done that with us there.
yeah right.
oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can not talk to rachel.
what?! when have i ever touched myself in front of you guys?
oh please! just before when you were asleep in the lounge! that armenian family was watching you instead of the tv. oh, that reminds me. that mr. hasmeje still has my gameboy.
(taking chandler aside) hey chandler, can i talk to you for a second?
sure.
dude i just did something terrible.
that was you?! i thought it was jack!
no! no, that was jack! rachel thinks i asked her to marry me!
what?! why does she think that?
because it kind of looked like i did.
again, what?!
okay well, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…
as we all are at some point during the day.
it was not my ring! it fell out of ross’s jacket! and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing!
ross had a ring?! and he was going to propose?
i guess.
and you did it first?! this is going to kill him! you know how much he loves to propose!
i know! i know it is awful.
well, what did she say?
(happily) she said yes.
does ross know?
oh god, what the hell am i going to tell him?
well maybe you do not have to tell him anything.
oh, i like that. yeah…
if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
(laughs) now let us not get carried away. (he walks away as monica comes over and hugs chandler from behind.)
i want a baby.
honey, we have been over this. i need to be facing the other way.
come on! come on, if we have sex again it will double our chances of getting pregnant. do you think that closet’s still available?
I am so tired. (she starts kissing him.) yeah okay, but no foreplay.
deal!
dad seriously! y’know you really should see someone about that!
i want to go talk to rachel for a minute, are you going to be okay alone for a bit?
(noticing something) actually umm… (he turns mr. geller’s head to look at emma.)
hey!
hi.
are you all right?
uhh… i think i just got engaged.
oh my god! he did it?
well…did you know he was going to ask me?
are you kidding? I am like the one who talked him into it. i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
and you really think this is a good idea?
i just talked him into it, do not tell me i have to do you too. the puppet master gets tired people.
i just do not know! it just does not feel right.
why?! you two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.
really?! even ross?
especially ross!
(entering) oh uh, hey pheebs. uh y’know what? I will-I will come back later. (he goes to leave but runs into ross who is entering.)
wow! kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I will guess just…I will come back. (ross exits followed by joey.)
there he goes, your fianc�e.
i guess so.
although he does play with himself in his sleep.
i can not say that I am surprised.
dad, what are you doing?
it can not be me, I am standing right here.
no!
y’know what? i do not like you without mom. (to joey) come on. (walks away.)
(to ross) we are not peeking? (follows him.)
hello sir, you know monica.
hey uh, is it okay to come in?
of course! oh joey, this ring i…it is beautiful i love it!
yeah uh look rach, there is something i got to tell ya.
hey!
yeah! hi emma. hey, why do you think she will not take my breast?
(watching) yowsa! (looks away.)
okay sweetie, you can do it. just open up and put it in your mouth.
dear lord.
I am sorry honey, what were you saying?
oh uh-uh yeah, i think that…
oh look, she is pulling away again! do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (joey gets embarrassed.) she looks scared. does not she look scared?
y’know, i do not really know her.
(to god) are you kidding me?!
it is just so frustrating! why does not she want my breast?!
i do not know! maybe she is crazy! (storms out.)
oh hey! wait up!
hi!
congratulations! i did not want to say anything in front of joey ‘because i did not know if he knew yet.
what, that we had a baby? come on let us give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
no! no, that you and rachel are engaged!
what?
oh, it is a secret. oh goodie! yes! we have not done the secret thing in a long time.
phoebe, there is no secret. okay? i did not propose.
are you lying? is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
(pause) i am a doctor! y’know what? I am just going to go and talk to rachel myself.
all right, me too. (they go into her room and see that she is sleeping.) should we wake her up?
no! no, come on let her sleep! she is so exhausted.
and so engaged. (points to the ring that rachel is wearing.)
what? (motions for phoebe to go outside with him.) oh my god! she-she thinks we are engaged! why? why? why would she think we are engaged?!
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? y’know ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
i did not give her that ring!
really?
no!
so whose ring is it?
it is mine.
is it an engagement ring?
yes!
but you did not give it to her?
no!
but you were going to propose?
no!!
huh, i might be losing interest in this.
look. look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel, but all i wanted to do is if she maybe…kind of…wanted ah…start…things up again.
oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
look, i did not want to rush into anything. and it seemed like she did not want to either. but i do not, i do not understand how any of this happened! what? did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that i was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
no! no, she said you actually proposed to her.
well i did not! i did not propose! (pause) unless uh… (pause) did i? i have not slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something i would do.
look, we can not stay in here forever.
oh, i still can not believe my dad saw us having sex! he did not make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
this is okay. we are all adults here; there is nothing to be ashamed of. now, let us put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (they do so and find mr. geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
hi dad! i can still call you that right?
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that was not for fun.
it was not fun?!
(to monica) why? why-why-would you—wh-why… (to mr. geller) look, i just do not want you to think that we are animals who do it whenever we want.
the truth is, dad, we are-we are trying.
yeah, we are trying to get pregnant.
well, that is okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
daddy?!
that is funny, this conversation’s how i got the bullet hole in my head.
daddy! i do not think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
i do not feel good right now.
seriously sir, my brains? all over the wall.
hey.
hey. i need to tell you something.
well, now’s a good time. I am on my way to have my ears cut off.
joey asked me marry him.
what?
joey proposed to me.
is he crazy?! you just had ross’s baby!
well, i-i said yes.
what?! are you crazy? you just had ross’s baby! it is-it is so inappropriate. no, it is worse than that. it is wrong. it is… it is bigger than mine! (rachel’s engagement ring.)
i know. days of our lives, thank you very much.
you can not marry him!
why not? i do not want to do this alone! and he is such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
well do you love him?
sure.
sure?
yeah, i mean whatever.
honey, the question is…do you really want to marry joey?
no. no, i do not. could you be a dear and go tell him?
you still have not told rachel you were not really proposing?
no! she had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
joey, you have to tell her what is going on! and what did it look like?!
i did not look at it. stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out.
look, it is not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me. i do not want to hurt her.
okay, look, just do it gently.
you are right. you are right. i-I will go tell her now before ross finds out and I will be gentle. i can do that. i am a gentle person. oh, by the way. two people screwing in there (points to the closet chandler and monica were in) if you want to check that out.
hey.
hey.
listen, i um… i heard about the engagement.
surprised?
and confused. rach, sweetie, i-i um…i did not propose to you.
i know.
i do not think you do.
you did not propose to me. joey did.
poor baby, you are so tired. rach, i did not propose to you, joey did not propose to you, and chandler did not propose to you.
uh… you did not propose to me, chandler did not propose to me, but joey did.
joey proposed to you?
i can come back.
hey, wait! wait-wait-wait! joey, did you propose to her?
no.
yes you did!
actually, technically, i did not.
well then why did you give me a ring?
wait! whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?
no! no, and i did not ask her to marry me!
yes, you did!
no, i did not!
yes, you did!
no, i did not!
yes, you did! and do not you say, "no, i did not!"
ahhh!
he was right there. he got down on one knee and proposed.
whoa! you were down on one knee?
yeah. yeah, that looks bad. but i did not…i did not propose!
then what did happen?
yeah, what did happen?
okay, the ring fell on the floor and i went down to pick it up and you thought i was proposing.
yeah, but you said, "will you marry me?"
no, i did not!
yes, you did!
no, i did not!
yes, you did—oh my god you did not! (screams) well then why did not you tell me that before?!
well i tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
whoa! hey! whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
(to ross) I will tell you about it later. be cool.
well then joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
it was not my ring! it is ross’s ring! that is why i felt so bad rach, because he was going to propose.
what?!
you were going to propose to me?
uhh… no.
well, this is awkward. {see? i told you so.}
but i-i was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—i mean that-that was all, rach.
dude, step up! i proposed.
no, you did not!
oh that is right. there is a lot going on here and i think i ate some bad fruit earlier.
okay.
(to joey) i can not believe you told her i was going to propose!
i can not believe you are not going to propose!
hey, I am not going to rush into anything!
oh yeah, dude, i totally understand. usually after i have a baby with a woman i like to slow things down!
oh my god!
what?
she is doing it look, she is breast-feeding look!
(looking at the ceiling) ah, it is beautiful.
okay.
thank you. (the nurse exits.)
oh wow, this feels weird.
good weird?
wonderful weird.
y’know what you guys? I am uh, I am going to go too. and uh, I am sorry about everything.
honey do not worry, it was my mistake.
no, rach, i should have told you sooner. it is just that…man! that kid is going to town! (joey makes his awkward exit.)
she is perfect.
we are so lucky.
we really are.
look, i-i know it is not a proposal and i do not know where you are, but with everything that is been going on and with emma and…I have been feeling…
i know. i know. I have feeling…
yeah?
yeah. (laughs nervously)
okay, well, that… wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.
yeah, maybe.
well good, okay. i-i, kind of think y’know if we…if… you are wearing the ring.
wh-what is that?
and you told phoebe you were engaged.
I am sorry, what?
when you thought joey proposed did…did you say yes?
(walking by with chandler.) hey dad!
hey.
tell him.
no.
tell him, tell him.
just...please tell him.
shut up!
tell me what?
look at you, you will not even look at him.
(sarcastically) oh, come on tell me. i could use another reason why women will not look at me.
all right, all right, all right. last night, i had a dream that, uh, you and i, were...
doing it on this table. (points at the table)
wow!
exellent dream score.
why, why, why would you dream that?
more importantly, was i any good?
well, you were pretty damn good.
interesting, because in my dreams, I am allways surprisingly inadequate. (monica pats him on his lap)
well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
i love it, when we share.
you are okay there?
i can not belive you two had sex in her dream.
I am sorry, it was a one-time-thing. i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
hello rachel.
get off.
(points at joey's pen) uh, uh, give me. can you see me operating a drill press?
i do not know. what are you wearing?
pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
just for some short-term-work. you know, until i get back some of my massage clients.
pirates again?
no, nothing like that. i was just...such a dummie. i taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." and they are.
hey, hey, chan. she could work for you.
(sarcasticly) thanks joey, that is a good idea.
what... i could, i could do it. what is it?
well, my secretary is going to be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused. (ross looks at her.) it is a whole big boob story.
i could be a secretary.
well, you know phoebs. i do not know if it is your kind of thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day.
i could do that.
what are you playing with?
oh, it is my new beeper.
what the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'help, come quick, they are still extinct.'
no, it is for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo.
a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
all right, I will see you guys later. (raises)
off to see young ethan?
thank you.
how young is young ethan? young?
he is... our age.
when we were?
okay, he is a senior in college.
college?
whoa! and this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
no, of course not. it is not even an issue. because i told him i was 22.
oh, i can not pass for 22?
well, maybe 25-26.
i am 26.
there you go.
can you hear that?
(plays with a thumbtack remover) yeah?
see that will stop when you pick up the phone.
oh. uh, I am on. (picks up the phone)
(with a deep voice) mr. bing's office. (listens) no I am sorry, he is in a meeting right now.
I am not in a meeting. I am right... whoops.
will he know what this is in reference to? (listens) and he has your number? (listens) all right, I will see that he gets the message. bye bye.
what?
ross says hi.
ah!
this is so fun. all right, what do we do now?
well, now, i actually have to get to work.
most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) okay, I am going to be out there.
okay.
all right. bye bye.
bye bye.
(answering it) yes?
What are you doing?
ooh. (leans against the desk)
windows are clean, candels are lit. uh, belt's to tight, got to change the belt. did i turn the fish? (goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner) no, because i made lasagne. (to rachel) am i out of control?
just a touch. mon, i do not understand. i mean, you have been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? i mean, why all the sudden are you so... oh.
what?
could tonight be the night?
i do not know. look he is a great guy and i love being with him but... you know. things happen, and they happen. you do not plan these things.
so, did you shave your legs?
yeah.
a-ha!
would you let it go ross. it was just a dream. it does not mean...
oh, oh. oh, oh. oh this is it. oh my god it is baby time. baby time.
all right, relax, relax. just relax, just relax. be cool, be cool.
(on phone) yeah, hi, i was just beeped. (pause) no, andr� is not here. (to joey) third time today. (on phone) yes, I am sure... no, sir. i do not perform those kind of services.
services? (ross looks at him) oh, services.
(on phone) yeah, you want 55-jumbo. yeah, that is right. that is right, jumbo with a you, sir. (pause) no, belive me, you do not want me. judging by his number, I would be a huge disappointment. (pause) all rightie, bye bye.
hey, hey. how was the first day?
oh, exellent. everyone was so, so nice.
see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (joey and ross wonder what he means) me.
no, i did not tell anybody that i knew you.
why not?
oh, because, you know... they do not like you.
what?!
i thought you knew that.
noho. who does not they like me?
everyone. except for uh... no everyone.
what are you talking about?
do not feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you are like "mr. boss man". you know, mr. bing. mr. bing, "boss man bing".
i can not belive it.
yeah, yeah. they even do you.
they do me?
you know like... uh okay... uh... 'could that report be any later?'
i do not sound like that.
oh, oh chandler...
oh... yeah, you do.
'the hills were alive with the sound of music.'
(reaches for hi scones) my scones.
okay, i do not sound like that. that is so not true.
that is so not... that is so not... that... oh, shut up!
did not.
how was that possible?
okay.
unless...
uh, ah. unless you want to stay over? i mean, I am going to, so...
okay, is this like 'i have an early class tomorrow' or 'I am secretly married to a goat?'
ethan?
are you a virgin?
really?
you keep saying that.
listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. and i, i-i figured if you could be honest, then i can to.
no-no. nothing wrong about that.
um, okay, here it goes. I am not 22. I am, I am 25... and thirteen months.
but i figured, you know, that should not change anything. i mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
you are not a senior?
ok...ay.
what we did was wrong. oh god, i just had sex with somebody that was not alive during the bicentennial.
ethan, focus. how could you not tell me?
well, that is different. my lie did not make one of us a felon in 48 states. what were you thinking?
do not say it. (closes ethan's mouth with her hand)
really?
well,fall out of it. you know, you should not even be here, it is a school night. oh god, oh god. I am like those women that you see with shiny guys named chad. I am joan collins.
(on phone) okay, andr� should be there in like 45 minutes. all rightie, bye bye. (to phoebe) just easier that way.
oh, come on. you told me about the last dream.
no, forget it.
oh, why not. was i doing anything particularly... saucy?
all right, fine. um, you were not the only one there. (camera fades to ross, who is listening very carefully) joey was there too.
all right. (moves closer.)
was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
no.
you are sure? nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
no, it was just the three of us.
huh!
so, tell me. was it like you and chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and chandler?
(laughs) you know what?
what?
there were times when it was not even me.
that is so sweet, you guys. (hugs them)
mon, ethan called again. mon?
what?
ethan called again.
oh.
are you not seeing him anymore?
no. you know, sometimes just things does not work out.
and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
i, i did not say any... i sw... i did not say anything, i swear. he stopped by.
listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest power ranger is?
oh, yeah.
ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. could we drop it now?
it is morphin time!
stegosaurus!
tyrannosaurus!
ooh, oh, I have got to go. (raises) whoa, oh, head rush. one more, and then i have to go. (sits down, and then raises again) cool!
where are you going?
um, oh, I have got a birthday party, with some work people.
work people? nobody told me.
no, i know. that is a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
you know, i do not get this. a month ago, these people were my friends. you know, just because I am in charge does not mean I am a different person.
well, then you should come tonight. you know, just hang out with them. let them see what a great guy you still are.
you think i should?
i really do, yeah.
okay.
okay.
okay.
oh, but, could we not go together? i,i do not want to be the geek that invited the boss.
i think last night was great. you know, the karaoke thing. tracy and i doing ebony and ivory.
you were great. but they still made fun of you.
what?
you know, now you are more like, you know like, "mr. caring boss," "mr.", you know, "I am one of you, boss," "mr., i want to be your buddy, boss man bing!"
then, i do not get it.
well, you know what chandler? i think you have got to face it. you are like, the guy in the big office, you know. you are the one that hires them, that fires them... they still say you are a great boss.
they do?
uh huh. but they are not your friends anymore.
i just wan't to...
no, but you can not.
but i just wa...
uh uh.
are not you going to...
oh, carol and i have a new system. if she punches in 911, it means she is having a baby, otherwise i just ignore it.
what about andr�?
oh, well this morning he got a call from who i think was our cousin nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than i needed to know.
that was going to be my opener.
(understands that monica and ethan want to be alone) hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
i thought that was just a rumour.
true story.
they are here already?
it was.
ethan, it is um... it is icky.
this is not easy for me either. i wish things were different, i... if you were a few years older, or if i was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, i would really...
...love you.
are you are hands still wet?
uh, moist, yeah.
let us dry  them again.
thanks. listen, about the weekly numbers, I am going to need them on my desk by nine of the clock.
you have to give  them something, you know. okay, now that was gerston, santos, and who is the guy with the moustache?
petrie.
petrie, right, right. okay, some people going to be working this weekend.

all right, all right, all right, let us play one more time, ok? and remember, if i win you do not move to paris.
ok! can not believe I am risking this again, but you are on! all right joe, you remember the rules! heads i win, tails you lose.
just flip!
damnit!
hey!
hey!
so we thought we would throw you little going away party around seven.
oh, that sounds good!
hey, rach, you are leaving tomorrow, should not you be packing?
it is all done!
oh, yeah, right! and after i took a shower this morning i just threw my towel on the floor! oh god, it hurts to even joke about it.
i know... honey, seriously, i did it all. the luggage that I am taking is in the bedroom, this is emma's paris stuff, these are the boxes that I am having shipped, and that is the sandwich that i made for the plane...
ok, so you have done some good work! (pause) what about your carry-ons?
oh, well. everything that i need (she takes her bag) is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that i will be needing them.
oh my god! i have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)
where is your passport?
it should be right next to my plane ticket.
well, it is not.
what? maybe i put it in here (she opens her bag). oh, oh, it is not in there! oh, no! i must have packed it in one of these boxes!
here, let me help you. (they both start opening boxes)
shoot. oh, i can not believe i did this!
oh, wow, can you believe you are like three weeks away?
you do not mind me touching your belly, do you?
hey!
hey erica, welcome back to town! (pause) wow, look how big you have gotten.
right, no, i understand.
no, no, i knew (he stares at her breasts).
she brought them up! (pause) i did not realize you were coming back so soon!
yeah, and i wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
hotel? why is not she staying with you guys?
because we are moving in a couple of days and it just did not make sense.
erica, those things are not free. in fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
ross! she is giving us her baby. she can eat you if she wants.
oh man, i can not believe you guys are leaving this place.
oh, i know. i know. hey, you know, you can take it if you want! the lease is still in nana's name.
no, no. this will always be your place. it would be too sad. plus, how much a month does it cost to feed joey?
yeah, it takes two incomes.
hey, is chandler here? we talked about catching a movie.
oh, no. he does not have time for that. but if you want, you can go help him and joey pack up the guest room.
mhm, (he balance things) packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
what are you guys doing?
try it, i can not feel a thing! (ross starts punching him too)
we are taking a break!
from?
jumping on the bed?
all right, rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there is a lot to do. now, ross, you got geller blood, you are in charge of these yahoos!
you got it! (monica leaves, ross closes the door). all right, she is right, we got to get serious. (he grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) let us put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
no, no, no, guys. she is right. we should get to work. I will take stuff out of the closet, joey you pack  them and ross you re-pack whatever joey packs.
you guys hear a ringing?
(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) what the hell is this?
hey! handcuffs! and fur line, nice! i did not know you guys had it in ya!
chandler, you do not have a sister so you can not understand how much this bums me out.
i did not know monica had these!
mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. maybe richard!
why would she use them with richard and not me? i can be kinky! i once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
hey!
hey! where is mike?
oh, he has a gig. i kind of like being married to a rock star, you know. my husband has a gig.
yeah? yeah, where is it?
oh, he is playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
rock on!
well, i thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that i do not want to move to the new house with me! so, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
(entering the room) hey.
hey.
hey, where is rach?
oh, she is putting emma down, she will be over in a second.
great.
now it just hit her that she is leaving and she is kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
yeah.
here she is!
what did i just say?
no, no, no. it is ok. I am going to be fine.
come here, I will make you a drink.
oh, man! i can not believe she is actually leaving. how am i going to say goodbye to rachel?
i know, she is been such a big part of my life. and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled. (ross and joey looks puzzled) i mean... oh, forget it. i miss melrose place!
yeah?
who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? head she wins, tails i lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) wait a minute...
yes, joe?
i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
well, I have been better.
uh-hmm.
you guys are going to come and visit me, right?
yes! you know, in six months the statute of limitations runs out and i can travel internationally again!
I am going to miss you so much.
i know.
you know what? uhm, i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you and i was going to save it until the end of the night, but come here (they go into the guest room).
hey, what do you think they are doing in there?
huh, if i had to guess I would say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching.
oh, pheebs, i do not even know where to start.
ok well, before you do, i know we were not supposed to get you going away presents, (she takes something out from her pocket) but i do have something for you.
oh, oh. (she is holding the present, a transparent bag with a white stick in it). what is this?
it is a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the dna to create your own pheebs!
I am going to throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!
chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.
oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you want to engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
what are you talking about? these are not mine.
oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
that would be a terrible punishment. but, I am serious, I have never seen these before.
really? then what are they doing in our guestroom?
rachel used to live in that room.
rachel... with handcuffs! interesting! (he looks excited)
joey's bare ass!
(he does not look excited anymore). well played.
i love you phoebe.
i love you too. (they hug) please do not... do not turn into... you know... french bitch! (they hug again)
all right. well, if i going to do this, I would better keep going.
ok.
ok. monica?
yeah?
can you come here with me for a minute?
sure.
(to monica) are you wearing waterproof mascara?
no.
oh, you are so screwed. (monica goes into the guest room)
(to phoebe) hey. what was that all about?
she is going to say goodbye to each of us individually.
are you kidding? oh my god...
yeah, i know, it is going to be even worse for you... god... ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
oh, man, I am not going to be able to handle this. (pause) now i know how my students feel at the end of each year. and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
mon... okay... I have got to... just say what it is I am going to say... none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it was not for you. no-one has been more like a sister to me...
i know what you mean. you are like a sister to me too.
(starts crying and speaking at the same time, making it almost impossible to understand what she is saying) i would not know what I am going to do without you...
(having the same problem) you are the best friend i ever had.
(says something that cannot be understood)
what?
i... i... i... (again saying something that cannot be understood)
that is so sweet. (they hug)
(to joey) oh no, she took down monica... and I am the crier in the family. oh god! i could be next. maybe she will not talk with me if it looks like we are deep in converstation. oh, so that thing you said about the thing. it really made me think about that other thing.
uh, rach?
well it is okay. chandler is talking to her.
i really made you think about that thing uh?
(to rachel) uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
(laughs) oh, I am sure going to miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i do not get.
no, no, no... they are really yours. we... found them in your old room.
well, these are not mine. maybe monica used to use them with...
do not say richard! well, if they are not monica's and they are not yours, then whose are they?
well, i think you are forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
pheebs!
(from the other side of the room) yeah!
i think these are yours.
these are not mine... look how flimsy they are, come on! good god! you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they will snap like a piece of licorice.
(to chandler) can i talk to you alone for a minute?
sure. (to phoebe) you do not really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
where do you think mike really is? (she giggles, chandler looks aghast)
oh honey...
let me just say something... because once we get into this, I am going to get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, I am going to miss you. and I am so sad that you are leaving.
(all mushy) oh, you know what? let us not say anything else. i love you. (they hug)
ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I am sorry, just give me one more chance.
okay. oh...
oh!
I am sor... just go. just go. i can not, i can not.
(to ross) so, i guess you are next. you are ready?
i do not think so.
oh, you are definately not. i have not cried like that in years.
you cried yesterday at the six of the clock news.
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
god! i can not believe she saved me for last. (looking out to the balcony) why are they taking so long?
i do not know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
okay, here we go...
oh... (holding ross's shoulder) well...
yeah...
i think I am going to take off. (pats ross on his back, but he looks very surprised)
huh?
oh, you guys. this was an amazing night. thank you so much. i love you. good night.
what? i do not get a goodbye?
(still very emotional) lucky bastard!
unbelievable. she says goodbye to everyone but me.
well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
well, it needs to be plicit.
all right, let us think about this. i mean, there is got to be an explanation. uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
no, i do not think so.
you know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. it was pretty intense.
yeah. mine too.
mine was a humdinger
(annoyed) of-kay... i mean, do not i deserve anything? i mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? (joey gives ross a hug) not from you! (joey let us go)
ross, if you are this upset, you should go and talk to her.
and say what? "you owe me a goodbye", i mean, he is got more pride than that.
the hell i do!
i do not get a goodbye?
what?
(talking agitated and angry) everyone gets a goodbye but me? what have i got to do to get a goodbye, huh? be best friends with you? uh, go out with you? have a baby with you? oh wait a minute, wait a minute, i did all those things.
ross...
oh no, maybe it is me, I am just not giving you enough credit. uh, i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises) it is physically impossible. you know what? after all we have been through, i can not believe this is how you want to leave things between us. have a, have a good time in paris. (he leaves the apartment. rachel looks kind of desperate.)
i hope ross is not too upset.
I am sure he is not more bummed out than i am.
tell me about it.
well, you can not say we do not know how to throw a party.
all right, i think I am going to head out.
uh, where do you think you are going?
i thought i was going home to go to bed, but I am sensing there is something less fun for me to do here.
we are moving in a couple of days and we have got a lot of packing to do. it would be great if you guys could pitch in.
joey and i can finish up in the guest room.
oh, yeah, yeah, good idea. (he mimes hitting his head with his fist)
oh no! you and phoebe are going to help me in here.
(to joey) you could not be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
okay, we are going to start in the kitchen. plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. got it?
good! now i need you to be careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.
hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are.
you did? how?
well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used.
oh my god! let me see. (they all look at the pictures)
who is that dirty old lady?
monica's grandmother.
nana liked it rough!
come on here, have a seat.
how was your night?
erica, are you okay?
oh my god!
relax! we just get her some antacids.
she does not have a stomach ache, she is in labor.
oh my god!
yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
all right, chandler get the coats. erica let us go. phoebe and joey, keep packing! oh my god we are going to have a baby. all right. we are going to have a baby! oh my god, we are going to have a baby! oh god, oh god, i got to sit down, i got to sit down. ooh! (she is hyperventilating)
honey, it is going to be okay.
okay, okay... okay, i feel a little better.
oh... yes, I am sure. oh honey, let us go. okay bye everyone.
chandler, wait, wait, wait...
what?
if you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
you really think i did not say goodbye to you because i do not care?
that is what it seemed like.
i cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know one thing about me.
fine, then why did not you say something?
because it is too damn hard ross. i can not even begin to explain to you how much I am going to miss you. when i think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... okay, so if you think that i did not say goodbye to you because you do not mean as much to me as everybody else, you are wrong. it is because you mean more to me. so there, all right, there is your goodbye... oh!
rach!
what?
you keep, you keep... you can not...
what?
a little more.
okay. (she starts to stuff styrofoam peanuts down the front of joey's pants.)
a little more, a little more. (she stuffs some more down his pants and joey's assesses the how many there already are in there.) a little more... all right. okay, all right, let us do this.
all right, ready?
yeah. all right, now give me your best shot.
all right, here it goes...
(in pain) does not work... (he falls down on on his knees with his head on the floor)
(sees rachel) oh, uh, hey rach. i uh, i was just coming over here to uh… oh wait, i do not have to lie to you, you do not live here anymore. uh, I am eating their food. what are you doing?
ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
whoa, i did not know we could date your sister!
joey we know you steal our food.
I am good.
(to rachel) oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
yeah. and y’know who should have shut their drapes? is that perverted old couple two doors over.
(looking) is that a swing?
oh do not even ask!
yuck!
i can not believe ross went out with rachel’s sister! when chandler made out with my sister i was mad at him for 10 years.
that was like 5 years ago.
yeah you got 5 years left!
joey…
you want to make it 6?!
oh ross, hi! hey, how are ya? there you are!
hey!
(to gunther) I will take a coffee. (to ross) so how was your big date last night?
uhh, it was okay. yeah, it was fun.
yeah fun? great! so uh, so did you guys hit it off?
i guess so.
so uh, so did anything happen? because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
no. no. nothing happened. i shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
oh, slides. (laughs.) so really nothing happened.
something could have happened. all right? she-she really dug my slides. and-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
right. was it the, "please do not show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
anyway, if she, if she was not in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
she asked-asked you out again?
yeah-uh-huh. tomorrow night, valentine’s day, the most romantic day of the year. who knows what could happen? i might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what i mean.
okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! i got it! i got it! i got it! i can not! i can not! i can not! i cannot go with you and my sister thing. okay? i just can not. it is just too weird, all right? i imagine the two of you together and i freak out. it freaks me out. i can not do it! i can not do it.
(while rachel is finishing her rant) okay! okay! okay! it is okay. (rachel stops.) it is okay. hey, it is too weird for you, i will not see her again.
thank you. i…yeah.
i mean after tomorrow night.
no-no-no! no-no-no! please ross, i can not! i can not do it! (starts to freak out.) it is just going to freak me out!!!
okay! okay! ooh-hey-hey-hey! okay! okay! okay! I will-I will tell her tonight i can not see her anymore.
ross thanks.
you want me to call her right now?
oh no! no! no-no-no-no! no, i mean come on that is-that is crazy—i mean that is crazy. so what is-what is going on with you? what is going on with you?
well umm, oh! i might be teaching another class this semester!
yeah do it now, call right now.
(crying) this is my favorite part.
(crying) yeah me too.
oh y’know what is sadder than this? bambi. i cried for three days with that movie. no wait two! because on the third day my mother killed herself so i was partly crying for that.
(totally not crying) well see now that i can see crying over, but bambi is a cartoon!
(crying) you did not cry when bambi’s mother died?
yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
chandler there is nothing wrong with crying! i mean you do not have to be so macho all the time.
I am not macho.
yeah you are right. i do not know what i was thinking.
no, i guess i just never really cried. y’know? I am not a crying kind of guy.
come on man there is got to be something that gets you choked up! like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I would be sad sure, but i would not cry.
okay, what if the puppy said, "help me chandler. all the other puppies pick on me."
cry?! i just found a talking puppy, I am rich!
oh, I have got it! i have got it! (gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the tv.) pictures from your childhood. this will get you going good!
all right, what is going on there? (points to a picture.)
oh, that is parent’s day, first grade. that is me with the janitor martin.
where were your parents?
oh they did not want to come!
oh chandler!
poor thing!
so that story does not make you cry?
no! look, i do not cry! it is not a big deal! okay?!
no! it is not okay! it is not okay at all!! you are dead inside!!
yeah?
yeah.
oh you are my biggest fan? I have always wanted to meet you! hi! (shakes his hand.) sure! yeah! (signs the autograph)
you are just saying that because you are my biggest fan. (the fan leaves and joey approaches.) (to joey) joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? (points) he is a fan. (to the fan as she is leaving) bye! (exits)
(to the fan) so, you saw me on days of our lives huh? want me to, want me to do a little dr. drake remoray for ya?
oh, you are phoebe’s fan!
movies?
(laughs) i do not think so.
hey gunther, do not let that guy in here anymore! he just said phoebe’s a porn star!
hey!
ohhh well. y’know what honey? the best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. oh! there is this great guy you will love at work named bob! he is a real up-and-comer in human resources.
it is not random, it is bob.
no honey, okay, okay, you want to know why ross canceled the date? because i asked him to.
hm-mmm.
because you are my sister and ross and i have this huge history…
no.
(changing the subject) y’know bob in human resources…
look, this is not that big of a deal! you just do not date ross! there is a million other guys out there, you just…
I am not telling you what to do! i am telling you what not to do!
jill this is not about me being jealous of you! this is about you being a brat! wanting what you can not have!
all right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating bob!
in human resources!!!!!!
…i am jealous of her?! i mean who does she think she is?! princess caroline?!
you are jealous of princess caroline?
do i have my own castle?
hey! uh, phoebe’s not here is she?
no.
(noticing the bag joey’s carrying) oh great! did you get a movie?
uhhh, yeah. yeah. but uh, i do not think it is the kind you are going to like.
you did not get more movies that are going to have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
sort of…
guys, what is going on?
(holds up the movie) phoebe’s a porn star!
phoebe buffay in buffay: the vampire layer.
oh my god!
that is phoebe! where did you get that?
well down at the adult video place down on bleaker.
and-and i, and i saw that joey was about to go in, so i ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then i pretended i did not know he was in there. (they all kind of look at him.)
wow! i mean, i just—i can not, i can not believe this. y’know, i mean you think you know someone even, even phoebe who is always been somewhat of a question mark.
this is so bizarre. i guess it kind of makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.
hey, i had a terrible childhood and i do not do porn.
yes, but you are dead inside.
all right well, I would better take that back.
wh-what, why?
we can not watch that! i mean that is phoebe!
yeah you are right, we can not—we should not watch this.
absolutely not.
(hands the tape back to joey, but does not let him grab it) y’know maybe a little bit!
probably just the first half.
no! hey no! this is wrong you guys! phoebe’s our friend! well, I am not going to watch it!
yeah! good for you joe!
yeah.
hold on a second! what is that on her ankle?
her ankle is what you are watching?
well it is hard to tell… (rachel gets up to get a closer look, only she is having some trouble.) oh god, if she would just stop moving.
she is just doing her job!
(sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the tv) you sick bastards!
oh, it is a tattoo! that is weird, phoebe does not… wait that is ursula! that is not phoebe that is ursula!
re! re! then i can watch that! rewind it! rewind it!
(entering) hey! what is up? (sees the tv) oh my god! what am i doing?!!
hey sweetie!
hey! (he quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
(picking up the book) chicken soup for the soul?
there is no back to this couch!
why are you reading this? you hate this kind of stuff.
yeah i know, but i figured a shot y’know? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you would not think i was y’know, all dead inside.
oh that is so sweet! look chandler i do not care if you can not cry, i love you.
oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
stop it!
no, i mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we are up at the altar and I am like this. (makes a bored face.)
i will not care, because i know you will be feeling it all in here. (points to her heart.)
yeah?
yeah! and if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you do not cry, so what! and-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it will not matter to me.
okay, well i will not uh, worry about this anymore then.
and-and-and if i die, from a long illness. and you are writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "i will always be with you," and you still can not she would one tiny tear, i know you will be crying a river inside.
aww, i love you so…
what is wrong with you?!!!
what?!
what?! you can not she would a tear for your dead wife!! now, i left you a note from the beyond!
so you did not mean any of that?!
no you robot!!
you damn kids! you ring my bell one more time, i swear to… (opens the door to find jill standing there.) ohh, uh jill. umm, that-that is just a little game i play with the kids down the hall. umm, they have really taken a liking to me. (quickly looks out to see if they are watching.) uhh what is-what is-what is the matter?
of course, what happened? (let us her in.)
okay, umm…
what?
wow! really?!
well, I would love to! here, you wait right here and I will go get the projector and my notes!
ohh!
hey! have you guys seen jill? i can not find her anywhere.
no, i have not.
well, is ross home? maybe I will just call him to see if he is actually seen her.
it is phoebe! phoebe!
(seeing her dress) oh god. so-so you are making porn movies.
you are making one right now!
and-and you are using my name!
look, I am talking right now! you are—you mean her.
what?!
no!! no way! no! and stop using my name! and shame on you! (yells into the apartment) and shame on all of you! you are disgusting! especially you (points to someone) with that! (storms away.)
slides are almost ready.
uh okay, well there is-there is wine in the kitchen.
(answering it) hello?
(on phone) what is my sister doing there?! and why are the drapes shut?!
of-okay, rach calm-calm down, okay? she-she is really upset we are just talking.
ross! i think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
so that is the only reason she could be here huh? it could not have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I am a good listener and i uh i put on a great slide show!
ross, i am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
y’know what? i think i can take care of myself, I will talk to you later. good-bye. (hangs up the phone and turns to find jill sitting really close to him.) whoa! uh, that was your sister actually. she-she thinks that you are just using me.
hey!
hey!
so, i just came from the company ursula works for.
oh no, not you too!
no! no! i just went to pick up phoebe buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.
nice!
um-mmm, and i will not have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address.
that is great, but is not it going to bother that people still think you are a porn star?
oh no! no! i know how to handle it.
you do?
yeah. (she notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where he is seen her before.) (to him) you are trying to figure out where you know me from? all right, I will give you a hint. from porn! okay? (he tries to rush his girlfriend out.) yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (to joey) see?
yeah.
hey.
(to rachel) you uh, you may have been right about jill.
oh! i knew it! what happened?
umm, she kissed me.
what?! you kissed!
(to monica) maybe we should give them some privacy.
(to chandler) shhhh!!!
look, i uh, i tried not to kiss her, okay?
well, it does not sound like it! i mean, it is pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just do not kiss them! see look at us, right now, not kissing!
let me finish, okay? she started kissing me and-and i did not stop it. i guess i-i just was not thinking…
yeah that is right you were not thinking! y’know what? let me give you something to think about! (she pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)
oh wait—hold it! but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing.
oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
look i-i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
what?!
no, i mean, look i do not know if anything is going to happen with us, again. ever. but i do not want to know that it-it never could. so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
wow. i, i do not even know what to say. thank you. (gently kicks him.)
you are welcome. (gently kicks her back.)
oh my god! are-are you crying?
(crying hysterically) i just do not see why those two can not work things out!
yeah, i got that.
you take care jill.
bye-bye-e!
bye.
(starts crying) i-i can not believe jill’s gone. (they all look at him.) i can not help it, i opened a gate.
hey!
good morning, tiger! I am making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. you are going to get me good and pregnant.
I have got nowhere to go this morning. I am unemployed! i do not know what I am going to do with my life.
well, i just lost my erection.
i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself?
you are supposed to find your passion in life. you can be whatever you want to be now. it is exciting.
but it is all so overwhelming. i do not know where to start.
hey, wait a second. i can help you with this. you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. there could be folders and files!
hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
i know!!! my erection is back!
(to gunther who comes over with coffee and a muffin) thank you!
joey, can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
okay.
 pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian?
I am sorry, it is just, I am a little short on cash.
if you want i could loan you some money?
oh no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends. no, that is why richard dreyfuss and i do not speak anymore.
oh, hey, how about this? want to be an extra on my show?
you could do that?
yeah, yeah. the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
oh my god, I am going to be on tv!
okay, now. i got to tell you, being on tv is not as glamorous and exciting as you think.
oh, really?
no it is awesome!
hi guys.
wow! hey, why are you all dressed up?
rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone. does not she look cute?
she sure does. why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I am going to whip them with a car antenna!
i think she is going to be the hit of the office, huh? she is going to be hotter than peasant blouses and a-line skirts. can i get a blue bow?
(flipping through bunch of folders as chandler enters from bathroom) okay, i have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
how long was i in there?
okay. let us start with the a's. advertising.
wait. advertising! that is a great idea!
do not you want to look through the rest?
i do not think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? ooh, now i get to use my shredder!
i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? "cheese. it is milk that you chew." "crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy." "a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
i got one. "socks. because your family's feet deserve the best."
honey? leave it to the pros.
i actually know someone in advertising. i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. maybe i can get him to meet you? give me the phone.
"the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
"marriage. it is not for everybody."
that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
I am just going to go in my office and pick up some stuff . (to the guy behind her desk) who the hell are you!?
I am the hell person whose office this is!
good one, rach.
excuse me?
joey, look at me! I am a nurse!
yes you are. i think it may be time for my sponge bath. sorry, I am just so used to hitting on the extras. so, are you excited about your scene?
yeah! but I am a little shaky and nervous.
oh, relax. do not be. you will be fine, you will be fine. they will probably just make you stand in the back.
okay, now. what?
I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. I am just a little nervous.
okay, that helps.
hey, you know what? do not worry, pheebs! it usually takes me three takes too! (off the director's look) alright, eight.
no, no. but let me show you what i can do. "bagels and donuts. round food for every mood."
really? that is great!
it is funny. when you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
actually, we are trying, and i do not think monica's going to want to postpone it. we are supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she is probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now.
wait a minute! what do you mean, you are taking over my job?
a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
alright! do not get too comfortable there, because I am back in two weeks! and i want everything back to the way it was. i can not say that i care too much for the way you have rearranged my office.
excuse me?
rach we have a code brown situation.
can you please, please take care of it for me?
alright, but you have to do one sometime.
let me just get this straight! so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
that is right. you are very cheeky for a temp.
oh yeah, what department was that? the jerk department?
did they mention that I am rubber and you are glue?
oh, hi mr. zelner.
that is great. so now, super gavin, when i come back where are you planning on flying off to?
(to herself) oh, wow. super ass-kissing power.
today.
no, i said today! see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
hey.
hey. so, what did he say?
well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I am going to replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." okay, so he said: "if your puppy friend does not get her puppy act together, I am going to fire her mother-puppy ass."
I am sorry, i can not do this. I am not an actor.
that is right, you are not. you are a nurse. you are nurse with tray.
joey.
no, no. nurse with tray does not know joey, she does not have time for friends. she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she does not, people die!
who dies?
(points to man on operating table) man with eye patch! you get in there and you do your job.
yes, doctor.
okay.
hang in there, man with eye patch, your tray is coming!
(does the scene) yes, i did it!!! i nailed it!!! yay! what is next?
okay, from the top, people!
listen. sudden change of plans. my maternity leave just ended. they told me that if i did not come back today, they were going to fire me.
what? no, that is illegal. I am going to have the labor department down her so fast they will not even...
alright, alright. calm down norma rae. they did not actually say that. I am just afraid if i do not come back right now this guy's going to try to squeeze me out.
what about emma? we do not have a nanny.
i know. you know, we are just going to have to figure out a plan tonight. can you please just take care of her for today?
absolutely. just give me your breast and we will be on our way.
come on, i do not know what else to do.
fine, fine. (to emma) we will have fun, will not we? yes, we will, yes we will. (gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)
ross?
huh?
you are pretty.
whatever i decide to do, I am going to be starting a career from scratch. it is going to be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
so you have to tell monica you do not want to have a baby right now?
yeah.
(hugs chandler) good-bye.
(enters) okay, it is baby time. pants off bing. (sees ross) did not see you there geller.
yeah, ross is here so...
yeah, and i was really hoping that i could hang out. what do you feel like doing?
we are going to have sex.
i do not feel like having sex. maybe we can watch a movie or something.
let me put it this way. we are having sex whether you are here or not.
pants off bing!
alright. now that I am back, why do not you just fill me in on what you have been up to?
hey, they were popular when i left!
well, i should be involved in that, so why do not you get me up to speed?
oh, no no no no. i see what you are doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. okay, I have had it for five years, and i know how it works, so why do not you just catch me up!
(sits down in her chair) oh god. you have totally messed with the back support of my chair. how do you fix this?
fine, i will. (pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it "collapse") alright, fill me in!
hey.
hey.
you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine.
oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we will all be wearing silver jump suits.
(enters from the bedroom) hi, good morning lover. i got to say after last night, I am a little weak in the knees.
here is an idea. you walk into a room...take a quick scan!
(to ross) sorry. (to chandler) but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
oh god, i have to tell you something. you are not pregnant.
what are you talking about?
that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it.
what!? you faked it?
you know what? i do not need a tie. i mean, it is better, open collar. you know, it is more casual (he leaves.)
joey, listen. i can not do this, it does not make any sense. yesterday i was a nurse, and today I am a waitress at a cafe?
oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. it is okay.
well, it is not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. and now suddenly I am the waitress? that is going to confuse my fans.
maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
uhuh. because I am a single mother, supporting my two children.
nice.
wait a minute. dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. would not i come over to say hi to him?
no, no. see, you and drake are having a fight.
about what?
he slept with you and then never called you.
and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky.
yeah, well, I am very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
oh, calm down! she means on the show! we need some new extras around here!
yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation. i actually made a few changes, but i think I am caught up on everything. so ask me anything!
except that! (mr. zelner enters) oh, hello, mr. zelner. we are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
what? i can not do that! i have the baby, and ross is not going to pick her up for another hour.
well, there you go. you win, you win. you get to do the presentation, you will knock  them dead, no one will ever remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter, and super gavin will just fly right along side of him!
no, i can not, i have a baby.
why would you do that?
that is really nice.
then you are not going to like what is coming. (starts crying) I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. thank you, thank you.
please do not fire my friend. just let me talk to her.
thank you, thank you. how about i do something for you? tomorrow, I will bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
hey, listen pheebs. i was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you do not hit drake, you just wait on the tables?
i can not do that. I am an actor. i have a process.
you are a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it.
wait a minute, i see what is happening here. you are threatened.
what?
yeah, I am so good in this scene that I am stealing focus from you. well, rise to the challenge tribianni because i just raised the bar. come join me up here!
(to the director) yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security, she will not go easy.
you faked it? you could not have faked it!
oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises.
guys can fake it? unbelievable. the one thing that is ours! besides, why would you fake it when we are trying to have a baby?
that is actually why. look, I am starting a whole new career now, and I am not saying that i do not want to have a baby, I am just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
like a month?
or a year?
really, you want to wait a year?
it could be less than a year. i mean, you have heard my stuff. "pants. like shorts, but longer." (pause) it will probably be more than a year.
i really want to have a baby.
yeah, me too. look, I will just get my old job back.
no, i want you to have a job that you love. not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
i quit and you learn what i do?
it is just, i think, there is never going to be a right time to have a baby. i mean, now you are unemployed and in a little while you will find a new job that will keep you really busy. there is always going to be a reason not to do this, but i think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
i guess. it is always going to be scary when we have a baby.
it is going to be really scary. i mean, god. when we have a baby, there is going to be so much that we are not able to control. i mean, the apartment's going to be a mess, i will not have time to clean it. what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? messes up all the ribbons?! what if there is no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? where will all the ribbons go!?!
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
yes, please!
oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time.
i wish i could say the same. I am a little shook up!
all right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a glass from the fridge.)
taste it.
(drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) yep, it is fat. i drank fat!
yeah, i know, i did that two minutes ago.
(entering) hey!
hey, mister tux!
why are not you guys dressed?
we have a half hour.
no, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
relax ross, we will be ready. it only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
well, you know, I would feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
(entering from bathroom) hey-hey! oh, look at you, all sexy.
really.
ooooh! wow!! oh, hi.
hi.
how come you did not come over earlier?
because, I am a stupid, stupid man.
hey, ross, want some cider?
no. (to rachel) so, um, let us see your pretty close, huh. make-up's on, hair's done.
yeah, i just have to get dressed.
yay! and that takes what? just six or seven minutes.
yeah! once, i figure out what I am wearing.
glass of fat?
what is a matter ross? what you are nervous about your speech?
no! do you want to hear it?
am i in it?
uh, huh. yeah, right after i thank everyone for giving money to the museum, i sing a song about the wonder that is joey.
(entering) hello.
hey!
whoa!
wow, hello! you look great!
thank you! i know, though.
you see this, this is a person who is ready to go. phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
ohh, well, you are my lucky penny.
(entering from bathroom, with an issue of cosmo) all right, i took the quiz, and it turns out, i do put career before men. (to joey) get up.
what?
you are in my seat.
how is this your seat?
because i was sitting there.
but then you left.
well, it is not like i went to spain. i went to the bathroom, you knew i was coming back.
what is the big deal, sit somewhere else.
the big deal is i was sitting there last, so, that is my seat.
well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there (points to the bathroom). soo...
you guys, you know what, you know what, it does not matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. so..
all right, ross, i just have to do one thing, really quickly, it is not a big deal. (yells at joey) get up!!
(entering) hi.
ooh, phoebe, you look great!
all right all ready.
(to ross) ooh, are you going to do magic?
that is, that is funny. change!
hang on a second i just got in.
look, i do not care it starts at eight, we can not be late.
we could not, would not want to wait.
look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is going to be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
has somebody been drinking my fat? (joey and chandler look at each other)
(entering from her bedroom) you guys, (holds up an outfit) does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
i do not know, you might be the first one.
rach, did you check the machine?
uh, no. wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. nevermind.
well, joey, i wrote a little song today. it is called: get up.
all right! you can have the chair.
really!
oh my, would you look at that! (holds up crossed fingers)
(on machine) "hi, it is me, I am coming over now. hey, what if I am already there when your playing this message?" (to the guys) is that too spooky?
(on machine) "hi rach, are you there? it is me, pick up. rachel. rach!"
(entering from her bedroom) what?!
nevermind.
is-is-is that message old or new? (yelling) old or new?! old or new?!
it is old, it is definitely old. did not you hear the, the double beep?
what if it is new? i mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. should not i call him back?
honey, you did call him back. because, it is, it is really old.
yeah, see mon, listen, listen. when carol and i broke up, i went through the same thing. and you know what i did?
huh?
i.....got.....dressed. really, really quickly. okay, okay. (rachel starts to follow monica into her room, but ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) there we go, there we go.
you know what, okay, fine. do not get up, you just sit right there. i just hope, you do not mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of joey's face) op, not touching, can not get mad! not touching can not get mad! not touching can not get mad! (joey flings some dip onto phoebe's dress)
ah! oh my god! you r-r-rotten boys!
I am so sorry.
what am i going to do?
no, no, do not, do not, rub it! do not! (clapping) what gets out hummus?! what gets out hummus?!
monica, monica, you know what gets out hummus.
if it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
okay, thanks. yeah, I will try that.
maybe he is calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
so, should i call him back?
all right, fine, you know what, we will both sit in the chair. (sits on joey's lap) I am soooo, comfortable.
me too. in fact, i think i might be a little too comfortable.
all right! (jumps up)
okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. okay, chandler, i want you to go and change! okay. and then, when you come back, joey will go change, and he will have vacated the chair. okay. okay.
all right! fine! I am going. but when i get back it is chair sitting, and I am the guy who is....sitting in a chair! (leaves)
(entering from her room) is this a little too... (sees phoebe) pheebs, what happened?
hummus. i got the hummus.
ooooh! honey, well we will find you something. do you want to wear my black jacket?
that will not go with this dress though.
no, you are right. well, we will find something. let us just get you out of that. come on.
no, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
monica, can phoebe borrow your green dress?
i called him.
yes. well i got his machine and i left a message. but it is okay, it is okay, it is okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. it was breezy! oh god, what if it was not breezy?
well, how could it not be breezy, no, because, you are, you are in such a breezy place.
here, i got it. I will will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it is breezy enough.
monica, how are you going to do that?
i know the code to his answering machine.
okay, mon, i really do not think this is the... okay, you are dialing, you are dialing.
wow, what a cool job. (in a machine voice) 'you have two new messages.' 'please, pass the pie.'
(on machine) "hi, it is monica. I am just checking in because i got this message from you and i did not know if it was old or new or what. so, I am just checkin'. so let me know, or do not, whatever. I am breezy."
hey, you can not say you are breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
now she sounded breezy.
he is seeing someone. i can not believe he is seeing someone.
monica, you do not know that.
well, who is voice was that?
maybe it was his sister's. you know, maybe it was his daughter's.
michelle! of course, it was michelle! did it sound like michelle?
oh, great. it is starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
it was michelle. it was definitely michelle.
pheebs, you go with monica and try on her green dress. if that does not work, you can wear my gray silk one. oh, gosh, what am i wearing?!
you do not, you do not know what your wearing?
well, hon-ey. I am just trying to look nice for your big night.
yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. all right, come on, I will just pick something out for you.
all right, you will notice that i am fully dressed. i, in turn, have noticed that you are not. so in the words of a. a. milne, "get out of my chair, dillhole!"
okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)
what are you doing?
you said i had to give you the chair, you did not say anything about the cushions.
the cushions are the essence of the chair!
that is right! I am taking the essence.
oh-ho, it will be back. oh-ho, there is nobody in the room.
look, I am sorry, i thought it looked pretty.
ross, that was a halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as little bo peep.
look, i did not recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
yeah, which, by the way chandler, i would like back one of these days.
oh rach, good, listen is not this perfect for me! (she is wearing another dress on a hanger around her neck)
oh, it is perfect! but not for tonight.
well, of course not for tonight. yeah, hi!
not for tonight. not for tonight! wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
no honey, we are sorry, we did not mean it. i love you. i love you.
we used them as pillows when we went camping.
what?
(shyly) the sheep.
hey, what you do on your own time...
(entering) where is my underwear?!
whoa, whoa, whoa. come on, come on, what. you took his underwear?
he took my essence!
okay, now hold on. joey, why, why can not you just wear the underwear you are wearing now?
because, I am not wearing any underwear now.
okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
it is a rented tux. okay. I am not going to go commando in another man's fatigues.
well, then it looks like somebody is going to have to give back somebody his cushions.
okay, you hide my clothes. I am going to do the exact opposite to you.
what are you, what are you going to show me my clothes?
hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)
he is got nothing!
(entering from rachel's room, wearing a huge bow to cover the stain) okay, I am ready.
rachel, did not have anything that i liked, so, but she had this christmas ribbon, and i thought,  right, fine I will be political.'
what are you supporting?
duh!! christmas!
okay, hey, that is okay with me. two down and i have exactly twelve minutes.... wha, my watch stopped. my watch. (shows chandler) okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail is not going around any more. (grabs chandler's watch) what time is it? it is 7:33, i have seven minutes. i have seven minutes!!
(entering from her room) okay, pheebs, quick, what shoes should i wear? the black or the purple?
just, just, just pick one!
okay, okay, okay, the black. but, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. maybe i should wear pants?
yeah, pants, what, what an idea. or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. look, i do not know what you are trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. no, no i do not care if they match. i do not care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. okay.
but i...
no, no, no just do it. go in there and pick something out so we can go.
all right.
thank you!
(entering from her room) okay. i got to call michelle. i got to see if that was her voice or not. I am sorry, i just have to.
it was, it was her voice.
monica, i think you have gone over to the bad place.
okay. that was her right?
definitely.
see there you go. woo! we are out of the woods. okay, I will get dressed now.
yay!
I will get it, okay. (answers phone) hi, monica and rachel's. (listens) yeah, just a second, can i ask who is calling. (to monica) oh, ew, it is michelle! ew! she, she must have that caller id thing. you should get that.
(on phone) uh, michelle. yeah, that was me, i-i dialed your number by mistake. (listens) oh, you are so sweet. yeah, we were a great couple. i know i really miss him. well, you know how it is, it is that....
(to phoebe) you know what is weird. donald duck never wore pants. but whenever he is getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. i mean, what is that about?
(on phone) michelle, i only beeped in so i could hear my message. i mean that is allowed. yeah-huh! i mean look, yeah, you know what i would really appreciate it if you did not tell your dad about. what do you mean, you are not comfortable with this? come on we are friends!! (michelle hangs up) that bitch always hated me. I am calling her back.
no, no, no, no. tick, tick, tick, tick.
okay, fine. (runs to her room)
they got a phone in there, right?
okay, we are on it. we are on it.
um. i know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
I am not going to gooo.
you are not going to go.
no, i think I am going to catch up on my correspondence.
how, how, um how can you not be going?
I am not going to gooo, so i think that will accomplish the not going.
um, you know, just out of curiosity...
well, ever since i was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I am just, i do not know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
right. right, okay, okay. I am sorry. I am sorry i yelled.
it is fine.
no, but, your-your mad.
I am not mad.
no.
I am just not going.
your not going.
right.
okay. you know that i-i have to go.
um, hum.
right. so is it going to be like 'I am abandoning you while your upset.'
no.
no, because your not upset.
right.
about the yelling.
right, and the humiliating.
oh, well of course, the humiliating. so, so wee, we are okay.
um, hum.
we are good.
right.
okay. honey?
yes, ross. (turns toward him)
i love you. (goes to kiss her and she turns away.)
(yelling from the bedroom) get away from that! no! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) she is just getting dressed.
is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that?
okay, buddy-boy. here it is. you hide my clothes, I am wearing everything you own.
oh my god! that is so not the opposite of taking somebody is underwear!!

oooo-ooh!
yeah. whew, it is hot with all of this stuff on. i ah, i better not do any, i do not know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
okay, okay. enough, enough with the lunging. no! I am sick of this. okay. I have had it up to here with you two! neither you can come to the party!
jeez, what a baby.
yeah, ross, way to ruin it. i was just going to get dressed.
you know what i do not care. the only person i cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she is not even going to go. look rach, I am sorry. okay. look, i-i wa, i was a jerk. I am sorry i yelled. i want you there, i need you there. look, what, what can i do that can show you how much, how much i want you to be there.
you could drink the fat.
hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
no, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. that actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
what?
i think you should drink the fat.
yaaaay!
okay, okay. if that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much i want you there. then that is what I will do.
oh, wait, let me get you another glass. that is been sitting out.
i think this will be fine. okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. cheers. (starts to drink, but rachel stops him just before he starts drinking)
no, no, no, wait! okay, okay. do not! I will go, I will go!
you will?!
you were really going to do that, were not you?
well, yeah.
you were going to drink the fat.
let us see what else he will do!
(to joey) how 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to chandler) you, give him back his underwear! I am going to go get a cab, and i want everyone down stairs in two minutes! monica!
stop it. stop it!
ross, went to get a cab so we can all... no, wh-what are you doing! no, monica, no!
not any more!
hi, uh, richard it is monica, um, listen i did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I am getting my period or something, i do not know. um, anyway, i, i, i beeped into your machine and i heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what michelle will tell you the rest. i, i, um, I am sorry, okay, i, i hope that we can forget the whole thing. okay, bye.
outgoing! did that say outgoing?! not, outgoing!!!
(on machine) "hi, uh, richard it is monica, um, listen i did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I am getting my period or something, i do not know." nooo!!
how did you do that?
i do not know!
noooo!!!!
(entering) okay, okay, okay, I have got two cabs and no people. go! go! go!
maybe we could call the phone company. maybe they could change the message. maybe they can change his number.
yeah, after this, i think he will be doing that himself.
rachel!! (she enters) wow! you, uh, you look, wow!
and i still have about five seconds to spare. (kisses him) okay, that was about seven seconds.
so we are a little late.
come on. (they start to leave) oh! and, uh, by the way....
what?
I am going commando, too.
awwww!!!
wow! what a pleasure.
excuse me. hi.
well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
i mean, i was sitting there.
but, i never left the room!
all right, that is it, give me your underwear.
you said you would marry joey?
okay you have to realize, i was exhausted, i was emotional, i would have said yes to anybody. like that time you and i got married! (pause) I am not helping.
so you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
that is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but i am prepared to let that go.
so when i came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
well—really? i thought chandler was your best friend.
well, chandler’s my oldest friend, but joey’s my—no! ah! (points at rachel)
ooooo!
(enters) hey you guys I am going to take off. i just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
rachel said she would marry you?!
(he looks around the room) this is not the right room, sorry folks. (leaves)
ok, i do not want to be negative so I will say that most of the signs you bought are good.
no they ran out of "it is a girl" but i can fix this one, (she writes "not" in between it is and a) see?
(looking at chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) so sexy. (waking him up.) honey.
yea yea. (pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
honey why do not you go lie down.
no, no, ross and rachel will be back soon and then i got to go to the office (pulls another balloon out of his mouth) am i producing them?
why are you so tired?
could not sleep last night you know, then i started worrying about this big divisional meeting that i have later today, the more i worried about it the more i could not sleep.  y’know? i was like, if i fall asleep now I will get six hours sleep, but if i fall asleep now I will get five hours sleep. not matter what i did i could not fall asleep.
you know what you should have done, you should have told yourself that little story.
(enters with emma) hi!
phoebe did the signs!
oh you guys thanks for doing this.
look at all the stuff people sent!
oh ah! (sees a big stuffed gorilla) oh my gosh there is something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! what are people think… (reads the card) oh you guys i love it.
hey so where is ross?
he is downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
is he still mad at us?
well, you more then me, but he can not stay to mad at me. i mean, i just had his baby.
that is not fair! i can not do that.
yeah, I am not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
see this is what i was afraid of, i did not think i should be here either but somebody (looks at chandler) said he would be over it by now.
hey, what do i know? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
walter (nods).
she is just so cute! i just want to bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
phoebe! but i could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
(enters from the bed room) okay i put most of the stuff away.
oh great, the pacifiers?
in the closet.
the burping clogs?
linen closet.
the diapers?
in the hospital.
wow you guys got a hospital?  fancy!
no i left the diapers at the hospital! there is some in the bag but I will run out and get some more.
alright thanks, oh ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
sure what kind?
umm let me think...what do i want, what d-of i w-a-n-t...
please take your time, it is an important decision. not like, say, i know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
blueberry.
blueberry it is.
thanks.
wow, he is really not letting this go, is he?
god how long do you think that is going to last?
i dunno, well he got over the "we were on a break" thing really quickly.
y’know i can not even worry about that right now, because i got the cutie little baby, oh i can not believe how much i love her, i can not get enough of her, like right now i miss her.  i actually miss her.
you know that is… that is her.
oh god look at her sleeping.  oh, i love her so much!  oh, i think I am going to wake her up.
oh no, rach, no no, you know you are never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
well i can do whatever i want!  i made her! (waking emma up.) come on little girl, hi!
i can say i told you so but she is kind of doing that for me.
oh I am sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. shh.   shhh! go back to sleep
breaks your heart does not it
it really does… how long do you think we have to stay?
yep.
(not knowing what he is saying yes to) yes.
well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! go back in time and listen to phoebe!
alright here is something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
ok. (starts swinging emma rapidly and she stops crying)
it worked!
oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (emma starts crying again.) oh come on, what am i going to do, its been hours and it will not stop crying.
umm, she rach, not it, she.
yeah, I am not so sure.
oh my god, i am losing my mind.
yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with ross!
hey gunther, can i get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? (he puts a bag with diapers in it on the counter.)
yep.
yep, can you believe it?
huh? ooh (laughs) you mean like a… huh?
(entering) hey. (ross turns to see who it is, and seeing it is joey he just ignores him and turns back around.) ross, i know you are pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
ah actually we do not. (ross walks off)
 fine, fine okay.  but i got to say technically, i did not even do anything wrong.
(turns back) what! (angrily) you did not do anything wrong?!
i said i did not technically.
okay let us put aside that you (makes quote marks with his fingers.) "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (does it again) "accidentally" proposed to rachel.
look, can i just stop you right there for a second? when people do this (makes quote marks with his fingers.) i do not really know what that means. (ross just looks at him) you were saying?
and i can even understand that you could not tell rachel, but why could not you tell me, huh? you had all day to and you did not.
i know i should have. (makes quote marks again.) "I am sorry."
not using it right, joe.
I am going to go.
no, come on ross! (he grabs his bag so he can not leave) look, ross, we have to get past this.
give me the bag.
no, look, i do not know what else to do. i said I am sorry!
joey!
you should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
I am not going to hit you.
why not?  you will feel better!  I will feel better, and you know you want to. i can see it in your eyes.
no i do not.
a little bit.
no.
little bit.
no!
(excited) a little bit more.
give me the bag.
no, hit me
give me the bag.
hit me.
joey, give me the bag.
hit me!
joe I am not kidding…
(interrupting) hit me, hit me.
no!
(shouts) hit me! hit me!
you ducked!!
I am sorry! it was a reflex!
oh my god, this really hurts!!!
i could not help it! when a fist comes at your face, you duck! look! (he goes to punch ross, expecting him to duck, but he does not and joey punches ross.   gunther is amused.)
what is the matter with you?!?
you were supposed to duck!!! why did not you duck?
why do not we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
good, good yeah, (grabs the bags) maybe while we are there, they can check your reflexes. (joey opens the door and it hits ross in the face with it.) (makes quote marks.) "oops."
try feeding her again.
i already fed her.
i know, that is why i said again!
alright you guys, we can not turn on each other, okay?  that is just what she wants.
(enters) hey.
hey.
monica can i talk to you outside for a minute?
oh no, you guys, just stay here, I am going to go check her diaper, pheebs you want to come?
oh I am kind of part of this.
actually pheebs its more of a husband and wife kind of thing
i knew i should have married chandler.
okay what is up
umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to paris for a year? you know, you could study french cooking and i could write and we could take a picnic along the seine and go wine tasting in bordeaux?
oh yeah (smiles).
okay, you know how that people say that tulsa is the paris of oklahoma?
what? who says that?
people who have never ever been to paris.
what is going on?
we are moving to tulsa! (makes a excited expression on his face)
excuse me?
okay, ms. mckenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to tulsa and be the president of our office there, and i was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
(stands up angry) tulsa, oklahoma!
the sooner state, whatever that is.
chandler, i do not even want to see the musical oklahoma!
really? oh what a beautiful morning!  surrey with a fringe on top.
are you trying to tell me that we are moving to oklahoma, or that you are gay? all right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
no, no, but they are going to lease us a ford focus. (monica’s not impressed.) I will get out of it.
thank you.
(hears emma crying) what is wrong with emma?
oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to tulsa.
umm madam, do you have a minute? (she points for him to come in) i kind of have some bad news. i do not think i can move to tulsa.
it is a funny story, actually. (coughs) i kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when i said I would move to tulsa, i did not really know what i was saying.
but only because i was up all night worried about this meeting, are not that funny? irony? not a fan, alright (he sits down). see, here is the thing. i went home and told my wife about tulsa and she will not go. see, me, i love tulsa!  tulsa is heaven!  tulsa is italy—please do not make me go there!
no no no! look, carol, can i call you carol? (pause) wh-why would i when your name is elaine? oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (she glares at him.) that is a picture of your daughter, is not it, well she is lovely. i like a girl with a strong jaw. I will call you from tulsa. (exits.)
hey, so how is it?
i broke my thumb.
your thumb? that is weird. (makes a fist.) you sure you are punching right? make a fist. (ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) maybe later. ross i feel terrible.
you know what, you can go, i just have to fill out some forms. (tries to hold the pen but can not)
you, you want me to help you with that?
why, does it look like I am having trouble with my misshapen claw? (he hands joey the form)
name? (ross looks at him.) i know ross but what is it short for? you know like, like rossel or rosstepher.
just ross!
it is pretty, okay date of birth?
you know my birthday.
sure, may...tember.
october 18th.
occupation? dinosaurs.
actually I am a palian… dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
ah, rachel i guess.
okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
just ah… just put roommate.
come on, you guys are more then that! i mean, you are going to get together right?
i do not think that we are.
but you two were supposed to be together.
well, i thought so too, but then she said she would marry you.
come on, ross, that did not mean anything! she just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
yeah that is what she said.
so?
so i do not want to be just anybody.
wow.
you know what, it is, it is better this way anyway. i mean i do not know what i was thinking, going down that road again with us. it is just much easier if we are just friends who have a kid.
really?
yeah.
and you are okay with that?
yes. i mean, it is what we always planned.  and if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  that is why they call them plans.  hello? (pause) I am fine.
hey, for what it is worth, with rachel i do not think you will ever be just (makes quote marks.) "anybody."
hey there you go! (smiles because joey used it correctly)
(makes quote marks) "thanks."
oh my god! how long has she been crying?
about a week and a half.
well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I am just going to go. (she gets up and rachel looks at her, upset, and monica just stares.) no! really? misery really does love company. all right! (she sits back down.)
rach, try holding her a different way.
you guys, I am doing the best i can, anyone else is welcome to try.
alright, I will try, fine! yes, okay!
here you go. (hands emma to phoebe)
shh! nothing works with this child! (hands her back.)
oh god what am i going to do you guys, i can not even comfort my own baby! I am the worst mother ever!
you are just new at this, it will get better, think about your first day at work. i mean, that could not have been easy but you figured that out.
yeah i do not think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! oh my god just please take her.
okay I will take her, here. (takes emma)
i have to go to the bathroom. (goes to the bathroom)
i have to go scream into a pillow. (goes to scream into a pillow)
(to emma) bouncy baby, bouncy baby, ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby, ooh baby baby. (emma stops crying and falls asleep)
(entering) have i gone deaf?
it worked! ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
you must be a fireball in bed.
i can not believe it!  she is asleep!  i got her to go to sleep!   i have actual magical powers!
i can hear traffic and birds!  i can hear the voices in my head again! (monica looks at her strangely) I am kidding. (she smiles wickedly.)
oh my god! you got her to stop crying!
yes i did, I am monica, super aunt
you are the official baby crier stopper!
yes i am!!
you are never leaving the apartment!
say what?
that is your new job, day and night, she starts crying i need you here.
(stands up to hand emma back) oh no no no no!
thankfully you do not need me at all (gets up and to leave) so okay super aunt see you later! rachel let us give it six to eight months (she leaves).
okay so listen I am going to go lay down.
what?
you know the book says that whenever she is sleeping i should be sleeping so… (she gives monica thumbs and goes to lay down)
(entering, loudly) hey!
shhh! we just got her to go to sleep
oh so there can not be any yelling.
no.
we are moving to tulsa
(loudly) what!?
shhhh! shhhhh! shhhhh! shhhhh! (walks backwards towards the door) i can not, i can not hear you. (he runs out)
hey.
heeeeey, where have you been? (he shows her his thumb) what happened to you?
ah i had a little thing with joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.
oh no ross! this is not good, we have to talk about this joey thing. please sit. (he sits) you have got to get over this joey thing, okay? i never really wanted to marry joey, okay?
okay.
you know what i really really want?
what, rach?
i want to sleep, i want to eat, i want to take a shower, i mean before she wakes up and we got to do this all over again.
(smiles) right.
i mean i got news for you mister, emma?  not easy.
well, that is what I am here for. (emma starts crying again) want me to get that?
no its really okay… monica!
(comes running out the kitchen to the bedroom) got it! got it! got it! got it! got it! got it!
you know, ah, I have been thinking about this and i got to tell ya, it is not my fault. it is a natural instinct.
(enters) hey, what you guys talking about?
hey ok great, what would you do if i did this? (swings to punch chandler, he moves and he ends up punching ross, knocking him off the stool. ross then gets up and just stares at joey.)
i can not believe we have never done this before! it is sooo good! so good for monica!
oh! look at that, time's up! my turn!
that was a half an hour?
it is your timer.
y'know, i do not like to brag about it, but i give the best massages!
all right, then massage me up right nice!
ah! ahh!! ahh!!
it is so good, is not it?
it is so good i do not know what I have done to deserve it!
say good-bye to sore muscles!
good-bye muscles!!
I am telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. and i wanted to give it up i just—i did not know what it was!
chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
look, for the first time in my life I am in a real relationship. okay, I am not going to screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
(walking up with rachel and carrying coffee) hey.
whoa, dude, look out! you almost crushed my hat! (he picks a hat up from the floor. it is one of those magician stovepipe hats.)
sorry.
(examining the hat) and the bunny got away. (turns and starts looking for the bunny as joey puts the hat on.)
(glaring at joey) this would be the place where you explain the hat.
oh! yeah, look there is this play all right? and I am up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. a real clothes horse. so i figure that everyone at the audition is going to be wearing this kind of y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
and you are going to make them all disappear.
yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
done.
joey, if you want to look good, why do not you just come down to the store? I will help you out.
great! thanks, rach!
sure! (pause) god, please take those off!
all right.
hey pheebs, how is it going?
hey.
hey! umm, well, only okay because i just got back from, from the hospital.
what?
is everything okay?
are you all right?
oh yeah, no-no-no. I am fine. I am okay, but umm, my grandma sorta died.
pheebs! sorry!
it is okay, i mean she had a really incredible life. and it is not like I am never going to see her again, y'know she is going to visit.
well maybe, maybe she is with us right now?
yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she is going to come to the coffeehouse!
(entering, in a hurry) guys! guys! i just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
uhh, pheebs' grandmother just died.
ohh my god, I am so sorry.
it is okay. actually y'know what, it is kind of cool. because it is like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
(to the guys) not the way they are doing it. what, what happened? how did she die?
well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
pheebs, I am so sorry.
it was really sweet. the last thing she said to me was; "okay dear, you go get the eggs and I am going to get the yogurt and we will meet at the checkout counter." and y'know what? we will meet at the checkout counter.
okay now joey, y'know that since you are returning all of this stuff right after the audition you are going to have to wear underwear?
all right, then you would better show me some of that too then.
okay, it is missing something. ooh, i know! umm, okay. (goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to joey.)
really? a purse?
it is not a purse! it is a shoulder bag.
it looks like a women's purse.
no joey, look. trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. look. (shows him.) see look, men, carrying the bag.
see look, women, carrying the bag. (he puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) but it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
exactly! unisex!
maybe you need sex. i had sex a couple days ago.
no! no joey! you-n-i-sex.
well, i are not going to say no to that.
it is phoebe.
umm, well i sorta have some bad news, can i come in?
umm, well, umm grandma died.
no, she just died today! okay, umm, we are having a memorial service tomorrow.
no you did not!
well, lots of people! look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
fine. okay, enjoy your concert. (starts to leave.)
hey!
hey!
wow! you look just like your son mrs. tribbiani!
what? are you referring to my man's bag? at first, i thought it just looked good, but it is practical too. check it out! it is got compartments for all your stuff! your wallet! your keys! your address book!
your make-up!
(entering) joey, what are you doing with the bag? you are audition is not until tomorrow.
yeah, but sandwich time is right now. (removes a sandwich and starts eating.)
joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can not return it.
why would i return it? i love this bag!
all right, then you owe me $350.
fine! do you take vasa or mustercard? (he is holding the fake credit cards that come with the bag.)
(glaring at him) joey…
all right relax, look I will pay you with the money from the acting job i am definitely going to get thanks to you.
what is the part, anti-man?
hey, do not listen to them. i think it is sexy.
you-n-i-sexy? (smiles provocatively.)
well hello, mrs. penella! thank you so much for coming! well, okay look, here is your umm, 3-d glasses and reverend pong will tell you when to put them on.
hi sweetie!
hey, how are you holding up?
hey pheebs, I am so sorry.
(notices his bag.) hey, y'know what? my grandma had the exact same bag!
here, i brought you some flowers. (he pulls them out of the bag.)
thanks!
pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
yeah, welcome.
umm here is your 3-d glasses.
so how did you know francis?
really?! what is your name?
you are frank buffay?
you just said…
but…
oh my god!
what?! what honey?
what happened?
that was my dad!
oh my god!
(approaches, wearing his glasses) hey you guys, check it out. check it out. (moves his hand towards and away from his face.) it is like it is coming right at me. (chandler helps out a little bit by pushing on joey's arm, which causes his hand to slap him in his face.)
oh, did you catch him?!
uh-huh.
wh-what did he say?!
he said, "nice to meet you glenda." (they stare at her, dumbfounded) well, obviously i could not give him my real name?
why?! why not?!
come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! what do you think? he is going to stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
what did you say to him?
well, i said, i told him y'know, that i was the executor person of francis' will and that i needed to talk to him so I am going to meet him at the coffee house later.
all right, well, i just can not think about that right now. i just want to say good-bye to my grandma.
okay.
all right, let us go say good-bye.
(entering, with bag) hey! I am off to my audition. how do i look?
ahhh, i think you look great! that bag is going to get you that part.
and a date with a man!
y'know what? make fun all you want. this is a great bag! okay? and it is as handy as it is becoming. now, just because you do not understand something, does not make it wrong. all right? so from now on you guys are going to have to get used to the fact that joey, (pats the bag) comes with a bag! (exits.)
all right, I would better go too. i have to go talk to my dad.
ooh, pheebs, what are you going to say? are you going to tell him who you are?
umm, no, not at first because i-i do not want to freak him out
well, but are not you pissed at him?! i mean this guy abandoned you! i got to tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! (getting worked up) i mean i-i-I would walk in there and I would be like, "yo, dad! you and me outside right now!" (calming down.) i kind of scared myself.
well, at least you scared someone.
y'know it is funny, you would think I would be angry. i mean, you would think I would want to rip his tiny little head off. fortunately, I am past it.
phoebe, you do seem a little tense. here, let me help you.
all right.
oh! get off!! ow!! oh, stop it!! why?! why are you doing that to me?!
what are you talking about?
as a masseuse and a human, I am begging you, never do that to anyone!
(indignant) i give good massages! (ross laughs.) i used to give them to rachel all the time before she got allergic! and-and-and chandler loves them! watch! (she starts giving chandler a massage.)
(seeing the look on chandler's face) he-he does not like it! he hates it! he is in pain!
no he is not!
(wincing) yes, he is!
what?!
I am sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
you have been lying to me? i can not believe you would do that.
well, maybe he just did not want to hurt your feelings.
but the minute we start to lie to each other… (pauses after she realizes what she is saying.) and by 'we' i mean society.
(reading from the script) well, you must be new here. why do not we get a table and I will buy you a drink.
yeah, sure. (he takes it off and starts reading.) well, you must be new here. maybe we should—I am sorry, can i ask you something? (he stops and asks a question.)
well, first it is not a purse.
i mean if-if you are thinking it is a woman's bag, it is not. it is a man's bag!
all right look, let me show you the catalog! (does so.) see? huh? it is the latest thing! everyone is got one! men! women! children! everyone is carrying them!
noooo. no-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
yeah but i did not read anything.
okay! all right, I will see ya. (as he is walking off stage.) (patting the bag.) we got it! we got it!
hey, is rachel here?
no.
(coming all the way in) listen, i just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. y'know? i-i really like  them.
oh, please, stop! look, we are supposed to be honest with each other. i-i just wish you could tell me—just say, "i do not like your massages."
(falling into that trap) i do not like your massages.
(starting to cry) see? it is no big deal.
okay, but now see you are crying!
I am not crying about that! I am crying about something that happened at work.
what?
(bursting into tears) my boyfriend said he did not like my massages.
it is okay, you do not have to be the best at everything.
oh my god! you do not know me at all!
okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
I am crying here!!
okay, hear me out. okay? you give the best bad massages. if anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "who is the best of that?" they would have to go to you.
huh. so you are saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
oh, it would be you! you! monica! and you would get all the votes!
so maybe they could umm, call the award the monica?
absolutely!
okay. i suck!
yeah! (they hug.)
umm, thank you for meeting with me.
come, sit. (he is hesitant.) sit. (still hesitating.) sit! (he sits on the arm of the couch.) umm, all righty, before we get started i just—i need you to state for the official record that you are in fact frank buffay.
okay.
huh?
oh yes. yes. yeah—no. she did. she left you umm, (looking in her purse) this lipstick.
okay. i have just a few questions to ask so I am going to get out my official forms. (she picks up a couple of crumpled receipts.) okay, so, question 1) you and uh, you were married to francis' daughter lilly, is that correct?
okay, umm, question 2) umm, did that marriage end a. happily, b. medium, or c. in the total abandonment of her and her two children?
yeah. see? (quickly shows him.)
hmm, okay, total abandonment. okay, reasons for abandonment, a. top secret government work, b. amnesia, or c. or you are just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
what?!
but you-you-you came to see lilly?
lilly's dead. (he looks up in shock.)
she is dead.
well, if she is not then cremating her was a big mistake.
17 years ago.
well, ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in soho. and phoebe, (pause) is on this couch.
yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
yes. well, that is neither here nor there.
y'know what, it does not matter what you say it is not going to make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
that is a defense?
you make up songs?
well, i am. (moves over and takes his hand.)
not yet, no. (drops his hand and moves back.)
(dejected) hi.
hey man, how did the audition go?
estelle said i did not get it. (sits down next to rachel on the couch.)
what?! why? joey you were so ready for it!
yeah, i thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
what kind of problem?
well to tell you the truth, they uh, (pause) they had a problem with the bag!
oh my god!
nooooo!
y'know what? it was a stupid play anyway!
y'know, joey, i think it is time to give up the bag.
i do not want to give up the bag. i do not have to give up the bag! do i rach? (she is avoiding his eyes.) oh, you think i should give up the bag!
honey wait, joey, I am sorry i mean as terrific as i think you are with it… (looks for help.)
oh, hey! (ross nods in agreement as well.)
…i just do not know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
i can not believe I am hearing this!
wait a minute! wait a minute! I am not saying that you should not have a bag, i just—it is just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (pause) controversial.
yeah umm, they are called wallets.
hey, would not be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? we could call it chuck.
or... dick.
(entering) hey.
listen, i-i need a favor. umm, i was in the shower, and as i was cleansing myself, i ah, i-i, well i felt something.
was it like a sneeze only better?
no, no, i mean, i mean a thing on my body.
(with a disgusted look) what was it?
well, i do not know, it is-it is kind of in a place that is not... it is not visually accessible to me, and i was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)
no!!
come on you guys, it is no big deal! (he turns around and shows him his thing.)
whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) huh.
well what is it? is it a mole? (he moves closer to them, and they jump back.)
no, it is too wrinkly to be a mole.
well, eww. what? is it a pimple?
no, it is... fancier than a pimple. look ross, why do not you just go see a…
(entering, interrupting them) hey guys! what is... (sees what they are doing and stops, the guys are stunned)
okay, well, it is definite, two more weeks of winter.
ahhh.
yeah, right.
(to her date) okay, and then this is the coffee house. this is where i play my music. (points to the stage)
yeah, and these are my friends. people. this is vince, vince the people.
hi!
hey!
vince is a fireman.
wow! have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
well, y'know if joey and i played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
you are right, i know.
okay. (watches him leave)
wow, he is cute, pheebs! but i thought you just started dating that kindergarten teacher.
oh, jason? yeah, uh-huh, we are seeing each other tonight.
what-pheebs?! two dates in one day? that is so unlike you.
i know, i know! I am like playing the field. y'know? like, juggling two guys, I am sowing my wild oats. y'know? y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
so pheebs, do they know about each other?
does a dog's lips move when he reads? (joey makes an `i do not know' face, and looks to chandler and rachel, who are also stumped) okay, no they do not.
(entering) hey guys!
hey.
hi!
(going over to him) well?!
(joining them) okay, how did it go at the doctor's?
well, he said there is definitely nothing to worry about, it is totally benign.
well what is it?!
he could not even tell me! he said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. and the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
y'know what? you should go to my guy, because when i went in there with my third nipple. he just lopped it right off. y'know? so i guess I am lucky. i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
at least they knew what yours was. y'know, yours had a name.
oh! maybe they will name yours after you! y'know, they will call it, the ross. and then people would be like, "awww, he is got a ross."
(sarcastic) yeah, that would be cool!
pete's breaking up with me.
i just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from atlanta, we need to talk.
and?
well that is it. people never say `we need to talk' unless it is something bad.
whoa, that does not necessarily mean that he is breaking up with you.
really?!
yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
that is so great! oh, i... (sees that a parked car near them has caught on fire) oh my god!
(the fire has worsened) oh my god!!!
(stopping him) no! no!
well, we do not n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we would, we would like a good mechanic. (hears the sound of approaching sirens) oh my god, here they come! well, we got to get out of here!
well look, if i wanted to see a fireman, i would date one. okay? (she drags him away)
th-th-that is all it is, a third nipple. y'know? just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. y'know? you can take it off. just slice that baby right off!
just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
no?
well then, what is it?!
(starting to get up) i got to go water pete's plants. (stops) y'know what, if he is going to break up with me, maybe i will not water his plants.
well, if he is going to break up with you, maybe joey and i should water his plants. if y'know what i mean.
or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
(entering with rachel) …and i-i can not take it! y'know? I am just, always afraid one of them is going to catch me with the other one. it is making me crazy.
well honey, then why do not you break up with one of them?
(disgusted) uh.
whoa-whoa-whoa. what ah, what happened to playing the field?
well, it just, it does not feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. it is like I am working in the field.
so pheebs, pick one of them.
yeah. which one do you like more?
well, vince is great, y'know `because, he is like a guy, guy. y'know? he is so burly, he is sooo very burly. (giggles)
okay, good, so there you go. go with vince.
yeah, but jason's really sensitive.
well sensitive is important, pick him.
yeah.
oh sure, go with the sissy.
jason is not a sissy!
oh no-no-no-no, i meant chandler.
y'know i have dinner plans!!
okay, this is the den. all right, check this out. lights! (the lights turn on automatically, but are very bright) whoa! all right. less lights! bad lights! lights go away! (they dim) oh, see you just need to find the right command.
yes, and the dimmer switch.
whoa! for a rich guy he is got, that is a pretty small tv.
no-no-no, that is a video-phone. but hey guys you are not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
(sitting down on the couch) i-kea! this is comfortable.
(entering with phoebe) this place is amazing.
god, that is the nicest kitchen.
i know.
no! but it is the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
look at this! a millionaire's checkbook.
joey, put that down! (the phone rings) oh my god! it is pete. okay, get out!! how the hell do you answer a video-phone! (steps in front of it, and automatically answers it)
i guess that is how.
oh it is umm, good! it is umm, it is good, just here watering the plants.
(standing up) ahh... chandler's on the couch!!
hi, how ya doing?
ahh, pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so i know, is it good news or bad news.
oh no-no-no, it is still me.
oh, oh, okay umm, so I will see you soon.
i love you.
okay. well, it is good news. it is good news.
so, what do you thing the good news is?
(looking at the checkbook) wow! look at this! he wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to hugo ligrens ring design. (monica is stunned) oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
oh my.
monica's going to marry a millionaire!!!
hey, you got to get mom on the phone. call mom! call mom!
and that is pete's mom.
mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “look how much money we have got!” y'know, i mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! you-you could have like little money place settings. and ah, you could start with a money salad! i mean it will be dry, but people will like it.
would you stop? we have only been going out a couple of weeks, i mean we do not even know if he is going to propose.
yes, but this is pete. okay? he is not like other people, on your first date he took you to rome. for most guys that is like a third or fourth date kind of thing.
well if-if that is what it is, then it is-it is crazy.
monica’s right. we are talking about getting married here. okay? she-she can not just rush into this.
oh please, what do you know! you married a lesbian!
all right. i got to go. i have break up with vince.
oh, so you are going with the teacher, huh?
yeah, i like vince a lot, y'know? but, it is just jason’s so sensitive, y'know? and in the long run, i think sensitive it is just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (her eyes glaze over thinking about the butt.) (pause) jason! definitely jason! okay, wish me luck!
oh my god!!! (she holds her hands up in triumph and the gang all look at her.) sorry, i was just imagining what it would be like to catch the money bouquet.
excuse me. umm, is vince here?
wow! i did not know you guys actually used those.
umm, wow. this-this is not going to be easy. umm, i do not think we should see each other anymore.
I am sorry.
oh my god, i did not…
(running after him) wait-wait-wait! wait!!
(to ross) I am telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
thank you, but i want to remove it pheebs. i do not want to make it savory.
y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
give me this. (grabs the herbalist’s card and leaves.)
(entering) hi! okay, do not be mad at me, but i could not resist.
brides magazines?
yes, and i know that you would say no if he asked you, but I am sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this donna carin. (shows her the picture.)
(gasps) oh, you so would! oh, you should get that anyway. (they both look at her.) like for clubbing.
it is so weird, i know what i said, but uh, this morning, i was lying in bed i was, i was imagining what it would be like to say yes. (rachel slams the magazine shut in amazement.) i know it is a little sudden, and it is a little rushed, and it is totally not like me to do something like this, but that does not mean i can not. right? i mean I am-I am crazy about pete, and i know that we want the same things, and when i thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
oh my god. (starting to cry)
i know. (pause) i need more pie. (goes and gets some)
hey mon umm, if you do get married, can i bring two guests?
you did not break up with that fireman?
no, that was my way of telling you. well, it turns out he is incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
wow!
yeah, well he would prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
so then, are you going to dump jason?
well, yeah, because i have to break up with someone, and… okay so jason is sensitive, (holds up one finger) but now so is vince (holds up one finger on her other hand) plus, vince has the body y'know? (holds up two more fingers on the vince side) so… it is really just about the math.
(knocks on the door) jason?
nah-ha!
hi.
listen, i got to tell you I have-I have never been to a guru before, so...
what is a koondis?
i guess it is worth a try.
what?! what?!
we?! we angered it?!
oh god!
ow!!
what was, what was that?
what?! how is that?
hey! (congratulates him)
ooh, nice.
oh, right! i completely forgot about that.
yeah?
wow.
what is that?
okay. (not sure of herself)
you want to what?!
what are you talking about?
and i suppose you used a ring designer for that.
my parents will be so happy.
(singing) “crazy underwear, creepin’ up my butt. (jason enters) crazy underwear, always in a rut. crazy under-(sees jason)-wear…” (in her head) oh no! what is he doing here? all right, just keep playing, just keep playing. you will get through this; you will be fine. (she tries to continue the song, but she has lost the ability to pronounce words, and the lyrics come out as gibberish.) (giving up on the song) okay, thank you. and, as always no one talk to me after the show.
hey!
i do not know, he just started kissing me. get him! get him, vince!
yeah, okay, I have-I have been dating both of you, and it is been really horrible. ‘because y'know it is been a lot of fun, for me. umm, but i-i like you both, and i, and i did not know how to chose, so... I am sorry, I am just, I am terrible, I am a terrible person. I am terrible.
really?!
well, this is none of my business. (starts to walk away)
well, i made you a candle light dinner in the park.
(to vince) well, that could have been really awkward.
yeah, but i-i-i-i can do that for you, I am going to do that for you.
(comforting the duck) everything’s going to be all right. okay, dick?
yeah, yeah. he is got a, he is got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can not do anything about it. is there something you can do?
good, you guys are all here!
hey! what is up?
well, i have a job interview at ralph lauren tomorrow!
i know!
boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
wh-what?!
i got this pair marked excess, i got to tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
anyway, I am going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I will work right under the director, it is the perfect, perfect job for me!
wow! well, if you nail the interview, you will get it!
yeah.
you want to work on your interview skills?
of-okay!
okay! all right, let us start with the handshake. hi.
hi.
very good handshake, good wrist action.
let me try. (gets up to join them.)
okay. (they shake hands and she pulls away suddenly) oh my god! what did i ever do to you?! (rubbing her hand.)
did i squeeze it too hard?
let us just say, I am glad I am not chandler.
that is right ross, i can see you in your new apartment! and you can see me! same as yesterday, (to monica) same as the day before.
is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
nope. op, wait! there he goes.
(waving) very funny ross! very life-like and funny. okay. (notices that a woman is waving back.) oh no-no-no, i was not waving at you lady. (she just stares at him.) (joey sees how beautiful she is.) whoa, maybe i was! hey, monica, this totally hot girl in ross's building is flirting with me.
get in there man! flirt back, mix it up!
yeah, i-i-I am down with that. (he turns back to the woman.) okay, here goes. (thinks.) how (holds up his hand like an indian) you (points at her) a-doing? (does a little twisting motion with both hands and ends up pointing at her, he then winks. she smiles and waves again.) (to monica) it worked! she is waving me over. (towards the woman.) okay, i-i-I will be right over. let us see, she is on the third floor…
(joining him) wow! she is pretty, huh?
tell me about it, huh? (realizes that she can see monica.) oh no-no-no, I am not with her, she is just monica! (he pantomimes that out.) ewwuck! (he pushes monica away and makes a disgusted face.)
hey joey! great stuff huh?
this is your place?
of course it is. yeah, come on in. ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. (he pretends he is surfing by the window.)
but i counted, you are not supposed to live here! oh man! (runs away.)
ugh!!
what happened?
i ended up at ross's place. oh, i musta missed counted or something. (looks out the window.) damn! she is not there anymore. oh, l-l-look, ross is doing his 'watching tv' bit. (we see ross sitting on the couch and flipping through the channels on his remote.)
no joey, i think he is just watchin' tv.
but it is just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
okay, then maybe i can come too!
all right, you go. (they kiss.)
'kay, bye!
oh god!
what?
oh i just miss him so much!
wow! for just a week you guys are really close, huh?
yeah, it is weird. i can not help it though he is so sweet, he is like this little puppy dog, y'know? but like a really tough one that shots bad guys. ohh, i just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! you just like can not keep your hands off each other.
i know it is the best.
so-so how long did that last for you and chandler?
what? it is still going on.
come on, seriously! when did it end?
i-i am serious, i mean, we are, we are all over each other all the time.
okay, you know where you are better than i do. i was just curious.
(start annoying hyper-competitive mode now.) (jumping up) what do not you just calm down phoebe! all right?! why do not you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you are the only hot couple!!
(under her breath) god, i woke the beast. sorry. (to monica) i was wrong obviously, i just—i misspoke. it is okay.
oh no, it is okay, i mean as long as you know that chandler and i are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! i mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
(entering) hey monica, here is your broom back.
you are so cute. (she goes over and kisses him passionately.)
oh hey, how did the interview go?
ugh, horrible! i did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
no!
so what happened?
ugh, it was horrible! and-and the interview part went so well, y'know? i even made him laugh. he said something about a boat and i was like, "well, yeah! if you have got enough life jackets!" (she starts laughing; chandler and joey are not amused.) trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
what happened?
(we see a flashback as rachel describes what happened.) all right, we were shaking hands and he kind of leaned toward me… y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but i totally miss read him and i uhhh… (the flashback shows that she kissed him on the cheek.)
you kissed him?!
well, i did not know what else to do!
well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
thanks chandler.
(entering from the bathroom) hey rach, a guy from ralph lauren called, you got a second interview!
i can not believe it! i got a second interview!
yes!
i bet that kiss is not looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
what-what, wait a minute, you do not think that is why he wants me back?
yeah! (chandler makes a noise) no?
a kiss? what are you talking about?
i accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, because "let us bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
come on, rach.
oh my god! what if he thinks I am the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
he probably wants you back because you are right for the job.
maybe. i-i do not know—oh god, how could i be so stupid?!
oh rachel look, do not say that, i think you just need a hug from joey. come on. come on. (she hugs him and joey looks out the window.) she is back! hot girl's back!
ohh, well I am not totally back yet, but thank you.
no, in ross's building! (he throws rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) she is back! she is back! (pantomimes) okay, wait there, I will be over in a second. (he counts where she is again.) got it! (runs out and does a little hot over a chair.)
i got to check out this hot girl! (he heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at monica.) there she is! (he dances over to her and kisses her.)
damnit!! did you move?!
yes. i lived with you guys for a while and then i found this place. (joey just stares at him) I am ross.
(looking around) uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
yeah. sorry about that. (he walks away and knocks on the next door which is answered by a little girl.) oh, hey little girl. uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
later! (he runs away down the hall and hides behind a corner to a whole other corridor.) oh man! (walks down the hallway in desperation.) hot girl! hot girl!!
hi!
thank you.
what?
excuse me?
(stopping him) wh-whoa! all right, okay-okay, i see, i see what is going on here! now listen, look-look, I am sorry if i gave you the wrong impression, but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! now even though i (he tries to interrupt and tell her about the ink), hey-hey-hey, even though i kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. i do not want, this job that bad. good day, sir. (she storms out of his office.)
(entering) ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from ralph lauren did too me!
okay-okay that-that is amazing. how did you know that?
you got ink on your lip.
oh. (realizes.) ohhhhhhhhh….
(to gary) so what do you say, maybe sometime i hold your gun?
oh, what can happen? i mean, would you… (he gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
oh we can not, we already have plans.
what are you doing?
well, same thing we did all day, hang out at gary's apartment. he is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. but have fun at the movie.
(that annoying competitiveness thing kicks in again, what the heck is that with her and why must the writers show it every flippin' episode?!) oh, we are not seeing a movie!
you are not? then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
oh umm, that is because i just wanted to y'know walk in on me and chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. will you excuse me for just a second?
yeah!
okay. (she gets up and walks over to chandler.) chandler? can i see you for a second?
uh, yeah.
okay. (they walk away to get some privacy.) we have got to beat them! {here we go yet again.}
why?
because, gary and phoebe think they are a hotter couple than we are!
ohh, so?
so! so we have got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! okay? it is crazy. {finally! the voice of reason.} i mean, just impress gary and phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I am saying no to this, why? get your coat.
(to the woman checking her mail next to him) hey!
(to the woman checking her mail) who is not?
i do not, i do not think we have meet. i-I am ross.
nevermind! (goes back to his mailbox.)
i had just moved in. thank you! listen umm…
jen, i know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise) but uh, would you maybe want to grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…
umm?
i will give you a call.
okay!
that was amazing!
phoebe and gary are so going to hear about this at dinner.
that was amazing.
we are the hottest! huh? no one is hotter than we are! you are the best.
no, you are the best.
no, you are the best.
no, you are the best.
i am the best.
(entering) hey guys! (sees their state of undress) what 'cha been doing? (has a silly grin.)
(looking out the window) hey joey! is not that the girl that waved at you the other day?
i do not know. but i can see through your sheet. (he looks out the window.) yeah, yeah, that is her. but y'know what? does not matter, I am never going to get to meet her anyway.
why?
because it is impossible to find her apartment! she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
what are you talking about? (pointing out the window.) she obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
no. no. no. she lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
no, those first two windows, (points) that is the lobby. and y'know the other one over there, that is the stairway. you have been counting wrong.
i did not know that! thank you monica. (starts to leave) i can not believe i almost lost another girl because of counting.
so uhh, you ready?
sure. (he opens the door to joey. needless to say, joey's stunned.) joey…
dahhhhh!! (ross has a puzzled look on his face.) no! noooo!! (storms off.)
ah, first, i-i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
(looks around for the camera) okay. umm, well, first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
now you are probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (she puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. rachel then does not know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and i think that is a big mistake and here is why. i made a huge fool of myself and i came back, that shows courage. when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, i said no. that shows integrity. and, i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) okay umm, now i know i already said courage, but y'know you got to have courage. and umm, and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, i said no and i was not litigious. {by the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  so she did not want to sue him.   do not worry, i had to look it up too.} so there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (pause) courage again, and not litigious. look mr…
zelner! right! i knew that! i really, really want this job and i think, i think i would be really good at it.
(gasps) oh! you are?
really? oh thank you! oh… oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
okay, well then how about a handshake? (she goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) oh god I am sorry! oh god, I am sorry! i did not mean to touch that—i mean you there. there. uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I am going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—hey! I will see you monday! (exits.)
you tired chandler?
you better believe he is tired, after the day we had! if you know what i mean. you know what i mean?
honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
oh yeah, it is so cool. (he opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) now i got to go, officer bing has got to, 10-100. (pause, softly) that is pee-pee. (heads for the bathroom.)
phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
ohh, (laughs) umm, we kind of took a little detour on the way over here.
you did not!
we did! we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
the park huh? a public place.
i hear ya. excuse me for just a second! (gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying got to-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)
hi chandler.
monica! this is the men's room! (pause) is not it?
yes it is. you see I have always found the men's bathroom very sexual. have not you?
no. and if i did, i do not think we would be going out. monica, this is getting ridiculous!
come on, we can not let them win!
ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
because phoebe and gary are in that-can not-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
(gasps) so?
i feel really sad that we are not…really there anymore.
oh wow! is that what this all have been about?
was not it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, I am more excited about where we are right now.
really?
yeah! I have never been in a relationship that is lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that is pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that is pretty exciting. (kisses her.)
that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way.
yeah?
yeah. (they hug.)
y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship.
did not.
yes you did! admit it! you freaked out!
okay, i freaked out a little.
little?! you freaked out big time! okay? and i fixed it! we have switched places! i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (does a dance of joy.) (monica glares at him.) and now we are back.
(laughs) i cannot believe ross is buying this!
thank god! i can not watch him anymore!
(entering) you guys ready fore the movies?
yeah! oh by the way, thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine.
(from his apartment) man! they cannot get enough! (makes like he is a robot and waves at the cutouts.)
this is unbelievable. it is been like a half an hour. if this was a cartoon, you would be looking like a ham right about now.
there is the waitress. excuse me, miss. hello, miss?
it is phoebe! hi!
wait, wait! wh-what are you doing here?
no, no... how come you are working here?
can we start over?
i do not know whether he is testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. but, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
no, yeah, I have done that.
and then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before i did, and peed all over the crossword.
I have never done that.
all right, now look at her and tell me she does not look exactly like her sister.
I am sayin’ i see a difference.
they are twins!
i do not care. phoebe’s phoebe. ursula’s... hot!
you know that thing, when you and i talk to each other about things?
yeah.
let us not do that any more.
hey pheebs, guess who we saw today.
ooh, ooh, fun! okay... um, liam neeson.
nope.
morly safer.
nope.
the woman who cuts my hair!
okay, look, this could be a really long game.
your sister ursula.
(her face dropping) oh, really.
yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
rift’s. yeah, i know.
oh, you do? because she said you guys have not talked in like years.
hmmm? yeah. so, um, is she fat?
not from where i was standin’.
(turning to chandler) where were you standing?
um, pheebs, so, you guys just do not get along?
it is mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, i mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though i did it... later that same day. but, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
oh, pheebs, I am sorry, I have got to go. I have got lamaze class.
oh, and I have got earth science, but I will catch you in gym.
so, is this just going to be you and carol?
no, susan’s going to be there too. we have got dads, we have got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
well, is not, is not that going to be weird?
no, no. (distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) i mean, it mighta been at first, but by now i, i think I am pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
ross, that is my jacket.
i know.
hi, um, I am err, (has to clear his throat) I am ross geller, and err ah... (pats carol’s bulge) ..that is, that is my boy in there, and uh, (points) this is carol willick, and this... is susan bunch. susan is um carol’s, just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent until) ..who is next?
susan is carol’s, carol’s, carol’s, friend...
like buddies.
you know how close women can get.
although i was married to her.
err, right.
a little.
absolutely. (turns back to the woman next to him.) so, twins... hah! that is like two births. (he struggles again.) ouch.
and (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, helen.
oh, okay. send her in.
hi, nina. come on in.
uh, yes. yes. I have just been going over your data here, and little thing, you have been post-dating your friday numbers.
well, it throws my wenus out of whack.
wenus. (coughs) weekly estimated net...
it is not just that she is cute, okay. it is just that... she is really really cute.
it does not matter. you do not dip your pen in the company ink.
ross, your little creature’s got the remote again.
marcel, marcel, give rossie the remote. marcel. marcel, you give rossie the remote right now... marce... you give rossie the remote...
great.
relax, I will fix it.
(looking at the television) cool... "urkel" in spanish is "urkel."
(looking at the remote) how did he do this?
(looking out at the balcony) so tell me something, is leaving the christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around new year’s... but obviously someone forgot.
well, someone was supposed to write "rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing monica’s note stuck to the refrigerator) how long has that been there?
hey, where you been?
i went back to riff’s. i think ursula likes me. all i ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
score.
she is so hot!
yeah, listen. okay, before you do anything joey-like, you might want to run it by err... (he indicates phoebe, who is helping ross understand the remote control.)
pheebs?
(jumping up) yeah?
you think it would be okay if i asked out your sister?
why? why would you want to... do that?  why?
so that if we went out on a date, she would be there.
well, i mean, I am not my sister’s, you know, whatever, and um... i mean, it is true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we have grown apart, so, um... i do not know, why not? okay.
cool, thanks.
you okay?
yeah I am fine.
you want to watch laverne y shirley?
sorry.
hi. sorry I am late. where is, where is carol?
no... no... no. i think i should stay, i think we should both know what is going on.
okay, I am going to play my sperm card one more time.
i see. so what do you propose to do?
flip me for it? no, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
mr. d, how is it going, sir?
and?
so what does this mean?
hey, listen, i know i came in late last week, but i slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
nina? nina. (he goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) nina. (in pain) nina.
(looking down at her hand) yes, yes i am. err, listen, the reason that i called you in here today was, err... please do not hate me.
(suddenly bright) would you like to have dinner sometime?
so pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
well, what i really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
okay... let me put it this way. anything from crabtree and evelyn?
ooh! bath salts would be nice.
ooh, okay... good.
yeah?
(smiling blankly) right, and it is me.
much as you are.
(philosophically) oh, that is good.
good choice.
i can not believe you. you still have not told that girl she does not have a job yet?
well, you still have not taken down the christmas lights.
congratulations, i think you have found the world’s thinnest argument.
I am just trying to find the right moment, you know?
oh, well, that should not be so hard, now that you are dating. (imitating men at their worst) "sweetheart, you are fired, but how ’bout a quickie before i go to work?"
hey.
you know, once you are inside, you do not have to knock any more.
I will get it.
oh. hi, mr.heckles.
we are not doing anything. we are just sitting around talking, quietly.
you do not even have cats.
(closing the door) goodbye mr.heckles.
we will try to keep it down.
phoebe, could you do me a favour? could you try this on? i just want to make sure it fits.
ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in her lap) ..oh, this is really...
oh, no no no. it is for ursula. i just figured, you know, size-wise.
ohhh... sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag) ..okay, it fits.
are you seein’ her again tonight?
yep. ice capades.
wow, this is serious. I have never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
i do not know. i like her, you know. she is different. there is uh, something about her.
that you like, (snappily confronting joey over the heads of the knitting circle) we get it. you like her. great!
hey, phoebe, i asked you, and you said it was okay.
alright, well, maybe now it is not okay.
okay... well maybe now I am not okay with it not being okay.
okay.
knit, good woman, knit, knit!
and that is the chrysler building right there.
yes, yes she is. did not i memo you on this? see, after i let her go, err, i got a call from her psychiatrist, dr. flanen-nen, dr. flanen, dr. flan.
and err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
oh, no, no. nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! in fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
and yet, believable. so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
well, i guess that is why they call it psychology, sir.
susan, go deep.
carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything’s going to be alright.
I am going to be a father.
this is just occurring to you?
i always knew i was having a baby, i just never realised the baby was having me.
(she comforts him too) oh, you are going to be great!
aw, how can you say that? i can not even get marcel to stop eating the bath mat. how am i going to raise a kid?
you know, ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
where are you going?
out.
with?
(spreading his arms wide) yes.
alright, could i just ask you one question?
have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
well, not that it is any of your business, but, no, we have not, okay?
you meant sex, right?
ah, sure, nina. what is up?
oh, well, ah... maybe that is because they are ah... jealous, of us.
ah, well, maybe that is, ah, because you are getting a big raise.
sure, why not?
oh, you do not know. (presses a button.) helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on miss bookbinder’s raise?
helen drinks. (insincerely) will you marry me?
well, i ended up telling her everything.
oh, how did she take it?
pretty well. except for the stapler thing. (he holds up a bandaged hand.) little tip: if you are ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
okay, i think i get how to do this.
alright, so, can we turn this off? can we just make it... make them go away? because i can not, i can not watch.
(remotely turning off the television) okay, pheebs, they are gone.
okay.
are you alright?
yeah. it is just, you know, it is this whole stupid ursula thing, it is...
okay, pheebs, can i ask? so, he is going out with her. i mean, is it really so terrible?
um, yeah. look, i mean, I am not saying she is like evil or anything. she just, you know, she is always breaking my stuff. when i was eight, and i would not let her have my judy jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. and then, oh, and then there was randy brown, who was like... have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
well, but that is what he was for me. and she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he would not even talk to me any more. because he said he did not want to be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
oh... oh, pheebs.
i mean, i know joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
you are not going to lose him.
hon, you got to talk to joey.
yeah. okay.
no, come on, he does not know this stuff. if he knew how you felt.
but he is falling in love with her.
oh please, they have been going out a week. they have not even slept together yet, i mean, that is not serious.
okay... okay.
oh, okay, oh.
rachel, what are you doing? it is freezing out here. would you come back inside?
no no no no no. you wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..I am takin’  them down. okay? whoa! (screams.)
oh-my-god rachel! (rushing out to look over the edge) rachel!
(to monica) I am okay! I am okay! (she knocks on mr. heckles's window.) mr. heckles, mr. heckles could you help me please?
wait. before we go in, i just want you to know i love you. i had a great time on our honeymoon, and i can not wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
you are really sticking with the she will necklace huh? (points to necklace of shells he is wearing.)
hi!
hey! you are back! (hugs and kisses all around.)
hi sweetie!
come on in!
so how was the honeymoon?
oh, so much fun. but the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the way back.
that was the best part? (to chandler) good honeymooning tiger.
no, they were really cool. they were on their honeymoon too!
they are terrific, and they live right here in the city.
yeah, can we go call them? is it too soon to call? i want to call.
I am sorry, we are just kind of excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
i know.
a couple? like two people? like (points to himself) one (points to phoebe), two people?
this is different! greg and jenny are in a relationship.
oh, greg and jenny yuck! (angrily) hi greg, I am chandler this is monica. hi monica, this is jenny. hi jenny. hi greg.
listen, they are really great. if you just got a chance…
y’know what? why do not you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
we really…did not get a chance to…
you have got to be kidding me!
we did not get anything for anyone.
hm-mm! yeah nice necklace!
that you can have.
hi!
hello!
welcome home.
so, how was the honeymoon?
it was great! it was great! how about you?! i mean you are having a baby!
oh! look! i have a sonogram picture!
oh great! (shows them the picture.)
ross! it is got your wavy black lines!
all right, so now that ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? i mean, when did it happen? how many times did it happen?
monica! that is not right! start with where.
well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh i had just got home from work and ross was already there ‘because i guess he had been hanging out with joey.
you are welcome buddy.
(glaring at him) yeah, thanks. (joey nods no problem.)
and so i had a lot of work to do so ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. and then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere ross comes on to me.
(laughs) umm that is…that is a little misleading.
what is?
the lie you just told.
that-that you came on to me?
there is the one!
but you did! i mean, let us be honest.
yes let us. y’know what? uh, it is-it is not important. what is important is that, is that we are having a baby. and it is not—does not matter who came on to who.
whom. (everyone looks at him shocked.) that is right.
you know you kissed me first.
what? what?! you were begging me to kiss you! you-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
i was sending you signals?
yeah!
oh please. okay, anyone in this room think that i would send ross begging symbols, please show of hands. (ross raises his hand and no one else.)
y’know what?! it does not matter! it does not matter what you believe! what matters is what happened!
okay. so these signals ross, explain this to me, ‘because maybe i need to be more careful. i mean, am i sending you these signals right now?
y’know what? y’know what? rachel, just-just drop it.
no please, show me how i begged you!
i can show you, i have it on videotape! (stunned silence) it is an expression.
i can not believe he taped the two of them having sex!
yeah! you got to tell a girl before you tape her. such a rookie mistake.
y’know who has a great video camera?
(nasally) greg and jenny?
do you still want to call ‘them? i want to call ‘them.
let us call ‘them.
yeah! ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
(on phone) hello? (listens) eighth street deli?
hey, hang up! you get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.
(on phone) uh sorry, wrong number. (hangs up)
here you go. (shows her the number again.)
(on phone) hello? (listens) (to all) it is the deli again!
all right! I will have a sandwich!
(hangs up) i do not think this number’s right!
what?
you got fake numbered.
what?! people do not do that!
oh i think we do.
they gave us a fake number? why? why would they do that?
i do not know! you were a delight to talk to. you asked all those insightful, great questions.
and you have never been funnier. joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
y’know what? do not worry about it, you still got me and phoebe.
excuse me, i do not want greg and jenny’s rejects.
(entering) rachel will not talk to me! she will not even open the door!
hmm, i wonder why. pervert!
okay, listen i am not a pervert!
that is like the pervert motto! yeah! yeah! they have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!
filming rachel is not something i planned. okay look, here is what happened, and joey you-you can back me up on this. all right, about-about a month and a half ago i came to you with a problem? umm, a personal thing.
personal thing? what personal thing? i do not know.
about…about sex? (joey looks at him confused) that i had not had sex in months?
(laughs) yeah i knew what you were talkin’ about.
hey!
hey.
do you have a minute? I would like to talk to you about something I am, I am really uncomfortable talking about.
sure. what? about uh, you showering with your mom?
i actually had a topic in mind! I am, I am kind of going through a dry spell, sex wise.
whoa, for like months?
five to be lying, six.
six months? whoa that is rough.
well, i mean it is not all bad. I am learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
the sky’s blue ross and i had sex yesterday!
please, help me! i have a date tonight. it has to go well okay—I am scared for my health!
okay. okay. umm…ooh! oh-oh, i got something. it is this story i came up with, very romantic. i swear any woman that hears it; they are like putty.
really? well then tell it to me.
okay. now you are going to want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
(sarcastic) I will try to control myself.
okay. (clears throat) years ago, when i was backpacking across western europe…
(laughs) you were backpacking across western europe?
have a nice six more months ross! (starts to leave.)
(stopping him) okay! okay! okay. I am sorry. please, please, you were in western europe and?
i was just outside barcelona hiking in the foothills of mount tibidabo. i was at the end of this path and i came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. and there were tall trees all around. (whispering) it was dead silent. gorgeous. (softly) and across the lake i saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…
(intently listening) why?
it is from france…in europe…western europe. y’know umm, a few years ago i actually was backpacking across western europe.
uh-hmm—wait! it gets better. um, yeah i was in barcelona.
anyway, umm so i was um, i was hiking…
(whines) oh that is great! i was hiking along the foothills of mount tibidaybo…
okay! do you want to tell the story?!
whoa! what are you doing here? how did your date go?
great! I am across the street having sex with her right now. your story sucks!
hey! look, if it did not work it is because you did not tell it right! show me how you did it.
no! no, i do not…do not want to.
how long since you have seen a girl naked?
i was backpacking across western europe.
I am not feeling it.
i was just outside barcelona, hiking…
no! no! no ross! I am not hot! are you hot?
it is been six months! I am always hot!
well you are not selling the story! it is like; it is like you do not believe it! look, i got to go. i got a date, but try this. do what i do when I am preparing for an audition. okay? I will set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you are doing wrong.
I will try that.
all right now… all right, you are all set up. you are good to go. just hit record. all right?
thanks.
good luck.
thanks. and-and hey joe?
yeah?
listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I will help you out.
(trying not to laugh) that means a lot to me man. (exits.)
hello! can i get you anything? huh? lens cleaner? your battery okay? (rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and ross jumps up.) rachel!
oh ross!
hi!
thank god you are here! you have to help me! were you just talking to yourself?
that is less embarrassing, yes. yes i was.
(voiceover) so when she came in, i got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [cut back to the present day.] it kept rolling and recorded everything.
yeah, we are going to need to see that tape. (they rest of them agree.)
yeah, definitely.
what a great idea! that will get rachel to forgive me!
y’know what? this is not fair to her. let us just forget the tape!
thank you. (joey mouths to ross, "you will show me right?") no!
you are right. (mouths, "i know you will show me, right?)
joey! no!
loud and clear! (mouths, "you will show me," and nods.)
i still do not get why greg and jenny would give us a fake number.
y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably did not give you real names either.
okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they do not give out fake names.
oh yeah? (to phoebe) hi, ken adams, nice to meet you.
regina philange. (ken and regina shake hands.)
i still do not get it, we did not do anything wrong.
i know! although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
i thought you said those jokes were funny. joke! joke! joke!
(rolling her head from side to side) joke. joke. blah! blah! (joey and phoebe laugh.)
well maybe it was all of your questions.
what about my questions?
the sheer volume, it was like flying with the riddler!
oh, I am sorry. was that another joke?
(angrily) was that another question?
(entering) hey! is ross still here?
uh no rach, he is gone. but listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
oh really? well how would you like it if i had sex with you and i taped it? (joey smiles luridly) oh forget it! (ross enters.) oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
look, it was accident! okay? i-i feel bad that it happened, but i swear, i did not even watch it! anyway, here. (he takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) i thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (tosses her the tape.)
thank you. (she sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) what? (they all yell again.) you do not want to see this do you?
hell yeah!!!
i am not going to show you this!
no! not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
forget it, she is destroying it.
okay fine! fine! we will just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘who came onto who,’ thing to rest! come on now, think!!
look, forget it phoebe. okay? it is rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. and she wants to destroy it. so, end of story.
i want to see it.
what?!
clearly you do not want people to see this tape. now i do not want people to see this tape either, but you so badly do not people to see it makes me want to see it. you see?
(confused) are we watchin’ the tape or not?!
i do not want people to see it for your sake.
ahh, i do not believe you. i think you do not want them to see you begging me. (goes to put the tape in the vcr)
rachel, please…
ah, a little preview!
fine. fine, but i want the record to show that i tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I am going to be saying…(he laughs and points at rachel sarcastically.)
okay, here we go. (pushes play.)
(on tape) hello! can i get you anything?
(to phoebe) I am so happy!
(on tape) oh, thank god you are here! you have to help me! were you just talking to yourself?
there i am.
you are going to get pregnant.
(on tape) i screwed up so bad, i told monica that i would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and i-i…
(on tape) you did not do it?
(on tape) i-i know—i had put them in…in-in my desk at work and i completely forgot about them until today.
(taking rachel’s hand) sweetie okay. it is okay. everybody made it to the wedding. I am fine.
kind of hurtin’ my hand though.
i know.
(on tape) (ross hands her a glass of wine) i cannot believe that i did this. especially after monica just went on and on and on about it! (mimicking monica) "okay rachel! here are the invitations rachel! now be very careful rachel! please, drinking no liquids around the invitations rachel!" (she tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) whoa oh! oh-oh-oh! oh…oh-oh-oh…
did you do it on our invitations?!
(pause) not on the ones we sent out.
so, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
(on tape) can you believe this is already happening? i mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
(on tape) i know. hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? how uh, you and i almost…
(on tape) oh, i remember how we almost. do you think we would have gone through with it? y’know, if we had not gotten caught. do you think we would have done it?
(on tape) i mean i…i know i wanted to. i just, i just was not sure if you wanted to.
(on tape) oh i wanted to.
(on tape) so we…we both wanted to.
(on tape) interesting.
(on tape) yeah. (pause) anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
(on tape) oh yeah, sure.
okay, in about ten seconds you are going to see him kiss me.
and in about five seconds you are going to see why.
(on tape) ross did i ever tell you about the time that i went backpacking through western europe?
okay, get ready to see some beggin’!
oh, you came on to ross!
what?!
now I am so happy.
what are you talking about?!
you used the europe story!
that is the magic story you use when you want to have sex!
how do you know about that story?!
how do you know about that story?!
i heard it from my friend irene who heard it from some guy!
(raises his hand) some guy!! (points to himself.)
no. no, she told me his name was ken adams.
(raises his hand and points to himself again) ken adams!!
hi.
so uh, apparently people are familiar with the europe story?
yeah. listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really does not matter. i mean, i think it would have happened either way. i mean if you had not initiated it i-i-i know i would have.
it was an amazing night.
it was. it was an amazing night.
you think it looked amazing?
i uh… i do not know. i mean i…i honestly did not watch it.
yeah, me neither. yet…
uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
yeah, it would be really weird.
good luck.
good luck to you.
mind if i mute?
oh please. (he does so.)
oh, oh there go the clothes.
you are undressing very quickly.
six months rachel, six months.
hey. we-we look…we look pretty good.
that is what i was going to say.
oh nice tan!
thank you! i had just gone to the beach that weekend.
ah….
have you been working out?
i have been working out.
really? wow, this is so much better than i…
oh that is not pretty.
oh! oh!
no!
oh god!
oh no!
oh, make it stop!
oh no!!
make it stop!!
no!!
have to make it stop!!
no!!!
(on phone) hello greg? (listens) hi, this is monica from the plane? listen, the number that you gave me 853-5… (listens) (to chandler) that is their old number! jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!
jenny! that is so jenny!
(on phone) hey listen umm, how would you like to get together? say next saturday? (listens) okay, how about sunday? (listens) okay umm, the week after that? (listens) the week after that? (listens) y’know what greg? y’know what? we are good, interesting, funny people with good questions and if you and your precious jenny can not see that then… (listens) january 15th? (chandler dances.) we will see you then! (listens) okay!
and that is why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. (baby talk) yes we were! yes we were! (picks emma up) come here gorgeous. (puts her on his knees and talks to her) oh! look at you! you are the cutest little baby ever! you are just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? but you have got... (in a softer voice) you have got big beautiful eyes... yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. (emphasises the b's) big baby butt! i like big butts. (raps) i like big butts and i cannot lie / you other brothers can not deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get...(emma laughs) oh my god, emma... you are laughing! oh my god, you have never done that before, have you? you never done that before... daddy made you laugh, huh? well, daddy and sir mix alot... what? what? you... you want to hear some more? uhm...(raps) my anaconda do not want none / unless you got buns hon... (emma laughs again and ross looks worried) I am a terrible father!
hi!
hey... hey listen... what do you guys know about investments?
how come?
well, I am starting to make good money on the show and I am thinking... i should probably do something with it.
what do you do with your money now?
well, i just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. (realises that anyone could have overheard that) i did not say that! it is in a bank guarded by robots!
do you have any ideas?
uh, yeah... this guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. that would be kind of cool huh? pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
joe... emus are birds. you raise them for meat.
(laughs) yeah! right! (points at monica) people eat birds... bird meat... now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "excuse me, I will have a bucket of fried bird." (laughs again) or... or maybe just a wing or... (realises...)
joey, i think you should consider something a little less risky. i mean, i think in this market, real estate is your best investment.the fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. (looks at chandler) that is right, i know some stuff!
real estate, huh? hmmm...
(very excited) oh, and you know who is selling a great apartment? richard!
(imitating monica) oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? monica!
my dad told me. they play golf together.
oh, well... maybe I will join them some time. i just hope the club does not slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
hi!
listen! you have to help me pick a dress because I am meeting mike's parents tonight! (rachel gasps)
wow, the boyfriend's parents! that is a big step.
(sarcastically) really? that had not occurred to me.
they just going to love you, just be yourself.
they live on the upper east side on park avenue!
oh yeah, she can not be herself.
okay, so... allright... which dress? (she holds up two 'phoebe' dresses, rachel and monica look at them... taking their time, do not wanting to hurt phoebe) you can say "neither".
I am sorry honey, but we are going to take you shopping. it is going to be fine.
yeah, totally! you are in such good hands. and I am so good with meeting parents. with the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. just kind of like: "oh mr. pincer, i can see where wallis gets his good looks..."
you went out with wallis pincer?
uh, he took the sat's for me.
i knew you did not get a 1400!
ssshyeah, well, duh! i mean...
so... now... what about with mike's mom?
oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. take it from me, moms love me. ross's mom one time actually said I am like the daughter that she never had.
(monica looks at rachel in disbelief) she said what?
(speaking louder and articulating) that is she is like the daughter she never had. (phoebe points at her ears) listen! (monica looks at phoebe in a duh! way)
hi.
hi.
i just finished getting phoebe all dressed to meet mike's parents. she is so nervous, it is so sweet!
guess what? i made emma laugh today.
(in disbelief) you what? and i missed it? because i was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. it was... it was like uhm... (ross tries to impersonate emma's laugh, but it comes out very squeaky, very high pitched. he laughs about himself but then looks at rachel, realises that it sounded weird and straightens his face.) only... only not creepy.
well... well, what did you do to make her laugh? (excited)
i uhm... well, i sang... (rachel gasps) well actually i rapped... baby got back... (rachel's face changes from excited to angry)
you what? you sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
but you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
(disgusted) owwwww...
please do not take her away from me!
hi I am joey. this is chandler.
so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt? medical malpractice? choked on his own moustache?
mmm that is enough about you!
is there anything we should know about the apartment?
no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we are not together. we are not a couple. we are definately not a couple.
well, you seem pretty insulted by that. what? I am not good enough for you?
we are not going to have this conversation again... look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man! (laughs) you do not think he is here, do you? (joey looks around)
you know what it is? it is a nice place but i got to see i do not know if i see myself living here. oh, oh, oh, let me see... (joey sits down on the couch, mimes opening a can and puts his hand down his pants) yeah, i could see it.
(chandler looks around the place and his eye gets caught by richard's video collection) look at these videos. you know, i mean, who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my god!
what?
there is a tape here with monica's name on it.
ooh! a tape with a girls name on it. it is probably a sex tape... (realises) wait a minute... this says monica... (looks around) and this is richard's apartment... (realises some more)
get there faster! (joey gasps and finally understands...)
I am wearing pantyhose!
oh, thank you! oh... oh my god, you are rich!
yeah, so... they got to die someday. (mike's parents walk in) hello!
(in a very posh accent) theodore... bitsy... what a delight!
and you... your home is lovely.
holy crap!
oh, try and stop me!
(no accent) I am trying to get your parents to like me.
(accent) got it! it... it is hard to stop...
(no accent) uhm... okay, well, allright, uhm... originally I am from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... i just moved to the city where uhm... i actually lived in a burned out buick lesabre for a while... (frowns are received) which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... i got hepatitis, you know, because this pimp spit in my mouth and... but i... i got over it and uhm... anyway, now I am uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, is not always steady money but at least i do not pay taxes, huh... (everyone in the room finds it a bit surreal, which phoebe realises and starts to talk in the accent again) so... where does everyone summer?
god! god! this is not going well.
okay, okay, okay, okay... still sure about me being myself?
so theodore... i uhm... i can see where mike gets his good looks from...
yeah... and that physique! you must work out all the time...
yeah i bet! look out! (phoebe punches theodore right in the stomach)
oh my god, are you okay?
I am so sorry!
i really, really am sorry.
yes... I am sorry, I have never met a boyfriends parents before...
yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... she looks nice, i can talk to her.
yeah... oh bitsy, hi. uhm... listen i just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
also uhm... i just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. especially to you. because he is very respectful of women.
are you kidding. he is so considerate of my feelings and... you know i think... you would also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
(mike now enters and stands behind phoebe) oh no, no, no, no, no, no. do not get me wrong. no, he is not in like a sissy way. no, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
I am not going to watch it... i do not need to watch it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching? (sighs) well, we know I am going to watch it. (chandler moves to put the tape in the vcr and joey enters the apartment)
hey dude, what is up?
do not judge me, I am only human!
did you take that tape?
i had to! okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... would not you need to know what was on it?
i do not know. who'm I am married to?
some girl...!?
she hot?
yeah...!?
how did she get me to settle down?
allright, I am going to watch it... i mean look, it is probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can not possibly be as bad as what I am picturing in my head... (laughs nervously) can it?
guess i do not know. my experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... she does not say no to much else, i tell ya...
then you are going to have to watch it for me.
(backs off) what? whoo... what?
just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is... please?
all right, fine... but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame... (chandler turns his back to the tv. joey puts the tape in the vcr, switches it on and watches what is on the tape... it is clearly a american football match, with the referee's whistle blowing, the crowds cheering...)
why am i hearing cheering?
well it is okay, its like... its just a football game.
football? just football?
yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
it is football... it is just football... this is great! this is the first time I have ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to get a beer... (chandler walks to the fridge, his back turned to the tv and a moaning sound replaces the cheering of the crowd... joey's eyes double in size...) what the... (chandler turns around, but joey already took a sprint for chandler, jumps, and floors chandler in the open space in front of the apartment door...) what are you doing?
you do not want to see what i just saw! (at this moment monica comes home, and sees chandler flat on his back on the floor and joey pinning him down)
what are you guys doing? (monica hears the moaning coming from the tv and looks at it) oh my god, is that richard? (it only takes a split second for joey to realise, he pulls monica down by her jacket, and she falls, face down next to chandler. chandler gets up a bit, and joey quickly covers chandler's eyes with his hand.)
okay... aahhh... please laugh for mommy... please? please laugh for mommy... (rachel makes a funny face, sticking her tongue out, making a farting noise and using her hands as antlers, wiggling her fingers... no response from emma...) not funny huh? oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? or maybe just, you know, rap in general? because mommy can rap... (rachel tries to rap and makes weird movements with her arms in the process.) my name is mommy and I am here to say / that all the babies are... oh, i can not rap... allright sweetheart... this is only because i love you so much, and i know that you are not going to tell anybody... (rachel's face is telling "oh what am i doing? the things i have to go through... and she starts to rap) i like... big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can not deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... (emma starts to laugh) yes! yes! yes! yes! oohhhhh! oh! (rachel now really gets into it, and her insecure movements start getting better) i like big butts and i cannot lie... / you other brothers can not deny... oh emma you are laughing! oh you are, you really do like big butts, do not you. oh you beautiful little weirdo... (rachel picks up emma and ross now enters)
hey!
oh you missed it. she was laughing. oh it was amazing. it was amazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...
oh i know, is not it? ooh... what did you do to get her to laugh?
oh! you know, i just... couple of things i tried ... i just sang a little doo... itsy bitsy spider...
you sang baby got back did not you?
nothing else worked. that girl is all about the ass...
...and then it goes back to the chorus... smelly cat, sme-lly ca-t / i-t's not your fau-lt. and that is the end of the song... i realise that you did not ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
oh, pervert parade?
oh, ode to a pubic hair?
oh god! is that veal?
oh no, no, no, no... that is okay, that is okay... i mean, I am... i am a vegetarian... except for veal... yeah no, veal i love...
no, no, no, i actually it is any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... you know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... (she cuts the meat, picks it up with her fork and holds it in front of her mouth, which she keeps closed, trying to overcome her vegetarian thoughts... and... puts it in her mouth... clearly not enjoying the meat...) hmmm... yummy (everybody seems okay with it, except mike. he is making a hmmmm.... face... then phoebe swallows it) hmmm... (at first she likes it, but then, in an instant puts her hand in front of her mouth and runs from the table. you hear a door slamming.)
so you stole that tape from richard's apartment?
whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn star!
that tape was never meant to be seen by... (pauses) joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private.
(laughs) monica, look... i do not think you and i have any secrets anymore... (monica keeps looking at joey) not ready to joke about it yet, okay, i see you later. (joey walks out)
why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
because that is who i am, okay? I am sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it would not bother him. just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
this is about you and richard. he is clearly not over you. he keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
is not that sad? i mean, can you see how pathetic that is? you should not be jealous. you should feel bad for him.
oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a moustache!
chandler, this is not our problem. we have got each other. that is all that matters.
yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
cowboy boots? I have never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! (she turns on the video again)
oh, good, good. play more, because i want to see how it ends.
that is not me!
what...? that is not you! life is good again! ride  them cowgirl!
that bastard taped over me! (chandler's expression changes)
is that a problem?
i-it is just so insulting! big spring for a new blank tape, doctor!
yeah... the woman you what?
i love you too...
yeah...! how great is this...? (they kiss)
okay.
i had a great time. (accent) it was really top drawer. and here is something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... i threw up in the coat closet... ta taaa...
she sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
so fellas
yeah!
fellas
yeah!
has your girlfriend got the butt?
hell yeah!
so shake it! (rachel slaps ross's butt on the beat)
shake it!
shake it! (phoebe, mike, chandler, monica and joey step in)
shake it!
shake that nasty butt...
baby got back (then ross turns around and sees their friends standing in the doorway)
one more time from the top... i like big butts and i cannot lie, you other br... (she also turns and sees the gang)
rachel please! that is so inappropriate!
(holding a lure) so now, what is this now?
guggly worm.
(laughs and picks up another lure) and this?
glow-pop giggly jammer.
(laughs harder) you make it so funny.
(not wanting to be left out, picks up something) hey umm, what is this?
(examining it) ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (monica drops the sandwich)
(pretend fishing in the living room) ohh, geller’s got one hooked! ohh! looks like a big one! yeah, ohh! ohh! (swinging the rod back and forth) it is the classic struggle between man and—(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) someone knocked over a lamp.
(going over and picking up the rod) that is all right. hey you guys, you know what is going to be great about the fishing trip this year? when my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. i can say, "well, I am doing a movie with charlton heston dad. what are you doing with your life?"
you do not have to stop having fun just because I am here. kathy did not cheat on all of you. (to joey) well, except you. (they hug and chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)
hey, joey, i do not think that you should leave chandler alone. i mean it is only been two days since he broke up with kathy. maybe you can go fishing next week?
look, there is nothing i can do for him right now, he is still in his sweat pants, that is still phase one. y'know? I will be back for phase two, i would never miss phase two.
what is phase two?
gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.
how does going to a strip club help him better?
because there are naked ladies there.
which helps him get to phase three, picturing yourself with other women.
there are naked ladies there too.
yeah.
(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) would you give me one minute!! please.
um-hmm. (joshua turns to look in the mirror and leaves rachel staring at his ass.) there we go. there it is.
yeah!
oh, okay. uhh, well let us see. (grabs his hand.) you are about—well uh, this one is large. and this one—(grabs the other hand.)
yeah! okay, two larges coming right up!
yes.
sure. you got it. great!
me, fledermaus, great. i really—(motions to joshua.)
so? (she puts her hands in his, totally forgetting about the gloves, and hoping for something more intimate.)
ohh! right! right, sorry, I will be right back!
oh.
no! nothing!
yeah! that would be great!
(shocked) well, i-i guess—i…
yeah, great, you betcha!
what?
oh. oh, right.
oh yay!
y’know, i can not believe kathy did this too me. i really, thought that she was the one. i tell you what, from now on I am never getting out of this chair, ever! okay? from now on, this chair is the one! you want to what else is the one? my sweat pants!
come on, man! just-just take the sweats off. okay? just take ‘them off and we will have some fun.
(entering) hey-hey!
hi!
hey!
catch any big fish? (phoebe, ross, and monica all go over to him.)
oh my god, you guys have no idea.
you stink!
are you kidding?!
yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. plus! i fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! hey, how-how is he doing?
he has not gotten out of that chair in two days.
(goes over to chandler) hey buddy! how is it going?
(to the rest of the gang) hey, see that? he just needed his pal to come home. all right, uh, I have got to go memorise my lines. (starts to go his bedroom) me and charlton heston bright and early tomorrow morning! yeah-yeah!
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey, monica!
uh-oh, what is the matter?
ohh, it is joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. but, i already told mr. waltham that i would take his niece to this dumb old opera. so… what are you going to do?
i do not know sweetie.
no! help me!
i can not! i have to work!
phoebe?
i would, but i get my morning sickness in the evening.
ugh!
unless! she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
ohh, gosh. you guys, come on, this is—i have to meet joshua! this is my one chance for him to see the fun rachel. y’know the "would not it be great if she was my wife" rachel. ohh, all right! are joey and chandler back?
no, chandler’s still in phase one, and joey’s that thing you smell.
ohh! (realises that ross is in the room.) hi!
hi!
so….
no.
ohhhh, come on!!!
i think she is here.
no! wait! wait-wait! ross, please!
you want me to take some girl I have never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy, hmm, that-that is a toughie.
(looking out the peephole) ohh, she is looking down the hall. oh! she looked right at me! oh wait, you can not see people through that little hole, can you? (goes back to the door.) hello!
I will be right there! (to ross) okay, ross, please come on! i thought we have moved on! i thought we have gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! i mean was that just me?
all right, I will do it.
oh thank you! thank you, thank you, thank you! (monica opens the door.) emily?
I am rachel green.
there is been a teeny-teeny change in plans. it turns out that I am not free tonight. so…
oh well, no i…
i-i-i think you look great.
I will get her.
please hurry.
do not you just love the way they talk?!
ohh!
what?
it kicked! i think the baby kicked!
oh my god!
oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.
(running from his bedroom) oh my god! i overslept! i was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! i got to get out of here!
oh wait, joey, you can not go like that! you stink!
look, i know i feel asleep before i could shower and now i do not have time! they are just ten blocks away, if i run, i can make it.
yeah. run ten blocks, that will help the smell.
hey—whoa, slow down. (gets a whiff of him) no, keep moving. (joey runs off.) wow!
so? how did it go with joshua last night?
well, i did not see joshua last night, but i did punch a girl in the face.
what?
why?
the whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when i got there, there was no rachel green on the list, but there was a rachel greep.
ohh! so, did you get to meet her?
no, there is no rachel greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I am rachel greep! I am rachel greep!" and he let her right in.
so you hit her in the face?
no, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so i clocked her. ohhh! i can not believe this, all i wanted was a few hours outside of work to see joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
(going over to comfort her) aww, pheebs.
honey, that is you are name.
that is short for phoebe?! i thought that was just what we called each other!
hey! you are wearing pants!
that is right! where are the guys? I am ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
it is 9:30 in the morning!
they got a breakfast buffet.
hello. (listens) oh, hey ross!
ooh, let me talk to him!
oh-oh, my god!
well, can i just…
(to chandler) shh!! (on phone) wait, what?
she is shhing me! it is my phone and she is shhing me!
shhh!! please! what is he saying?
he is with emily at a bed and breakfast in vermont!
what? oh my god!
what? who the hell is emily—(realises) noooo!!
they are in vermont!! how could this happen?! (she waves her arms franticly and hits chandler.)
ow!
how—how did end up in vermont with that awful witch?! (she hits chandler again.)
maybe, she does not hit him all the time.
when we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! who would not be miserable? I am telling you when i got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
I have got to go, there is a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! (he hangs up and runs out.)
he had to go, there is a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
i do not get this! she was horrible! (she hits chandler, yet again.)
okay, I am going to go stand over there. (points and moves into the living room.)
why do you care so much anyway?
i do not care! all right, y’know what I am just upset that I am getting nowhere with joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to vermont!
well, when you first met barry, you flitted off to vail.
oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!! (storms out.)
so y’know, uh, when is he getting back?
a couple of days.
y’know, i knew something like this was going to happen. (he starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
what are you doing?! chandler! you can not just go back a phase!
yes you can. you are thinking about time, you can not go back in time.
well, look, why do not you just, why do not you do your phase two strip club thing with us.
yeah, come on, we can be guys!
(laughs) no you can not.
come on! let us be guys! maybe we want to be guys!
you do not want to be guys, you would be all hairy and would not live as long. (starts to go to his bedroom)
y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
okay. (starts to cry)
I am sorry. (goes and hugs him)
(rushing in) hey! joey tribbiani! I am here! I am here!
look at that, charlton heston eating a liquorice whip!
(trying to act like he is not the one that stinks.) whoa! yeah, what the hell is that? what smells so bad?
y’know, i can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who i think it is?
no-no, it is uh, it is heston.
yeah, the man wreaks! smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
really, a shower huh? and uh, which-which room might that be?
interesting.
(coming back to the stage and sitting next to chandler) okay, I have got some ones, you want to put them in her panties?
no thanks, mom!
oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, ‘because I am pregnant.
ha-ha, it is not my baby, ha-ha-ha! (he leaves.)
very good, (getting up and sliding a one into the dancer’s hot pants) so good.
(doing the same) i really, really enjoyed it. very exotic.
(joining them) well, i just checked our messages and joshua did not call. i mean you would think he would be worried about me not showing up at his club. ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, ross is all happy in vermont!
come on! look where you are!!
(to the waitress) when you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
remember, a virgin for me please.
oh! and do not let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
ahh, come on! y’know what—y’know what, i think I am just going to go home and call kathy.
well, if you think it will help.
no! that was a test! in a couple of hours I am going to get really drunk and want to call kathy and you guys are going to have to stop me! and then after that, I am going to get so drunk, I am going to want to call janice
you should! how is she?
ohhh!!
i think somebody needs another lap dance. (motions for one.)
how ya doing?
i guess you would not believe me if i said i was kurt douglas, huh?
no-no-no, no, no, wait. you see, I am an actor, joey tribbiani, I am doing a scene with you today, and well, i stink.
yeah-yeah, I am one of the cops that will not work with you ‘because you a lose cannon. anyway, look, I am really sorry, but i stink!
yeah.
oh no-no-no, you do not understand…
oh yeah, yeah.
yes sir! yes sir, I am-I am—(he starts to leave)
yeah. oh, yeah.
so, we did okay at the strip club, right?
oh yeah, that was great. thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
(entering) i can not believe it! he still has not called.
who, josh?
it is joshua.
what, he does not like josh?
no, i do not.
all right, well I am going to put my sweats back on.
oh no! wait! wait! okay, y’know what, you were right, you were right. we really were not great at being guys, but you know why? because we are girls.
yeah?
and do you know what girls are really good at?
stripping!
no, listening! sit! y’know, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.
yeah, come on! what is going in on in there? (pats his chest.)
yeah. and y’know, if you want to cry, that is okay too.
okay, look, I am going to have to ask you all to leave.
come on! chandler!
look, forget it. we tried, but phase three is a lost because, okay? those strippers were insanely hot, and i could not picture myself with any of them. (sits back in disgust.)
they really were pretty, were not they? (rachel and phoebe both agree)
yeah, i really liked that fighter pilot one.
oh, candy! she was so spunky!
yeah.
y’know, i think if i were going to be with a woman. (chandler is intrigued.) it would, it would be with someone like michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.
see, i do not know, for me it would have to chantal.
oh, chantal!
oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! i mean when i stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
(jumping up) phase three! i just achieved phase three!
really?!
i am totally picturing you with all those women!
that is-that is not phase three.
well, I am there too!
well, are we all together? like in a group?
stop it! you are killing me! i think i just moved on to phase four!
oh! what is that? what is that?
where i do not want to have a relationship ever! i just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
come on, let me see that smile.
i do not want to.
please?
i wanted to go to the strip club!
i know, i know, but you are going to have plenty of chances. there are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
yeah, all right. (ross enters.)
hey!
hey!
hey—ooh so, how was vermont?
emily is…incredible. i mean there-there are no words to describe it, i mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (sees rachel coming back from the bathroom.) oh! and you! rach!
oh, hey!
hey! you were so right!
what?
uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
oh, hmm.
i mean, i, i-i admit i-i was not quite there. y’know, i mean the thought of you and that-that josh guy…
joshua.
joshua…guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kind of…y’know.
yeah, i…
but now! I am there! I am totally there! I am-I am finally where you are!
oh, thank goodness!
yeah, and-and thank you for emily.
oh, no problem. I am so glad i could help. happy for you. (she playfully punches him.)
happy for you. (he punches her back.)
no, happy for you! (hits him harder.)
all right ladies, here is what we are going to do. (points to a stripper.) you are going to take off my clothes. (to another two strippers) you two, go get the oils. (to another stripper) and you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "chandler’s the king! chandler’s the king!"
i-i want to be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) i like her.
oh, that is fine! go with your instincts, go with your instincts.
wait, now, what am i doing again?
come on! would you please pay attention, i could wake up at any moment!
no-no-no, that’ not joshua.
what do you want from me, I have never met the guy. so anyway, rachel, I am sorry you can not stay, (rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (the cigarette guy starts rubbing chandler’s back.) what are you doing? (the guy just nods) all right, listen, I have got to wake up!
can i see the comics?
this is the new york times.
okay, may i see the comics?
guys. i thought you were taking ross to the game?
we are. he is meeting us here.
no! rachel is meeting us here.
oh come on, they can be in the same room.
yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
why? what happened now?
well ross was hangin’ out over at our place, rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from chandler....
yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? rachel came over to borrow something.
anyway! her and ross just started yelling at each other.
wait. why was he yelling at her? he is the one who slept with someone else.
well, i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
whoa!! he is soo unreasonable! god, although i think i understand what he means. oh my god, this is like 60 minutes, okay, when, when, at first you are really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
y'know what this is like? this is like when my parents got divorced. man, i hope ross does not try to kidnap me after cub scouts.
y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together, they never broke up. and we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
i had the same dream!
yeah, and nobody slept with that xerox girl.
oh, i had the opposite dream.
y'know what maybe it is going to be okay, i mean it is been a week.
yeah, i mean it is never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
it is never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
(seeing her) okay, let us go!! let us hit the road!!
hey!
let us get the show on it!
okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
oh rachel, i know the best coffee house and it is sooo close.
closer than here?
(turning around and picking a cup off of a table) oh, hey, look, i found coffee! (handing her the cup) okay, let us skedaddle.
wait, I am not just going to drink somebody is old coffee.
okay, your highness.
(in a deep voice, imitating ross) um, rachel I am really sorry. (imitating rachel) that is okay, do you want to get back together? (imitating ross) yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) did anyone else hear that?!
(softly) is he here?
no.
oh. (smiles) here is your moisturiser. hi!
you guys are going to love meee! okay, check it out, thursday night, five tickets, calvin klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they are all silent and look away) okay, i said that out loud right?
yes, yes, it is just that we ah, we kind of all ready, made plans with ross.
oh, well okay. well, there you go.
no, it is just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
hm-mm.
yeah, he is really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
ohh!
we are sorry honey.
oh, it is okay. (starts to leave)
rach, it is, it is ah, it is not that we do not want to, really. (quietly) are we talking models in their underwear?
and heels.
(he turns around to chandler looking for approval to go with rachel, chandler mouths ‘come on!’) (turning back to rachel) ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
no, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that is only fair. (leaves)
ohhh boy, do i feel bad.
oh yeah.
very bad.
chandler what are you doing?!
chandler!!
(jumps back and points at the cigarette) oh my god!
you are smoking again?!
well, actually, yesterday i was smoking again. today, I am, I am smoking still.
why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
look, I am telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when i started smoking in the first place.
were not you nine?!
yeahhh. I am tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
oh that is great, with my luck, that is going to be him.
him? him, ross?
nope, hymn 253, his eyes are on the sparrow! when my parents got divorced is when i started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and it is rachel again.)
hi! uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? because i have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. huh? I am asking you first, right?!. i mean I am playing by the rules.
chandler! you are smoking? what are you doing?!
hey, shut up!! you are not my real mom!!
(obviously cold) hey, can you close that window chandler? my nipples can cut glass over here!
wait. really?! ‘because mine get me out of tickets.
look, you guys i just want to say, i really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. it is been a pretty hard time right now, so i just want to say thanks.
can somebody else hug him? i have to stay by the window.
oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? huh, huh, what do you think? (in an irish accent) two days of darts, it will be great!
it will be great for next weekend.
no, no, no, this weekend guys!
it will be great for next weekend. i mean, (in an irish accent) it will be grrreat.
what is going on?
well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know rachel’s sister’s cabin. (chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)
so, for the whole weekend?
we are really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
yeah, that is okay, i mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I am alone by myself, y'know then i totally, totally understand.
y'know what, i can stay, I am going to stay. ‘because the last time i went skiing i was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, i just went around and around.
uh, pheebs we kind of need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I will stay.
noo! I will stay. he is my brother.
what a pity stay?
no! we are going to have fun. we can make fudge!
pity food? y'know what that is okay, all right, i do not need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.
well, then, i might as well offer to stay.
(to chandler and monica) hey, does anybody else feel bad about ross?
why? do you think he is still mad at us?
(to joey) well he is probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
what? mine are not tinted.
chandler!!
what?
what does the sign say?
beam me up jesus.
no, the ‘no smoking’ sign. there is no smoking in my grandmother’s cab.
okay, well, then, i-i have to go to the bathroom.
please!
no chandler no! no unscheduled stops. you can go when we stop for gas.
oh, come on, there is a rest stop right up there! come on, i really have to goooooooooo.
oh, now i have to go!!
here we go. okay, brace yourselves.
what?
okay.
ow!
(to rachel, who is staying in the cab.) are not you going to go?
no. thank you.
(getting out) no, rachel never pees in public restrooms.
well, they never have any paper in there y'know. so my rule is ‘no tissue, no tuschy.’ (phoebe laughs and gets out.) well, if everybody’s going. (she gets out and starts to close the door.)
no, y'know what do not close it (rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) ‘because the... keys...are in there.
oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
what is going on?
(to joey) my lighter’s in there! (points to the cab)
damn! (stands up) the tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
relax okay, i-i-i can get this open. anybody have a coat hanger?
oh i do! op, no, wait a minute, i took it out of my shirt when i put it on this morning.
so, if you are parents had not got divorced, you would be able to answer a question like a normal person?
look, i just need a wire something to jimmy it. oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
what?!
what?!
come on! who has the biggest boobs?
please!!
whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
if you want to get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
okay, monica’s are the biggest.
these tiny, little non-breasts?! please, it is got to be rachel.
what, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small i mean, i-i-i actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
all right then, your bra would still be big.
no, i stuff outside the bra.
ladies, ladies, let us just compromise okay? phoebe, rachel take off monica’s bra.
all right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
(seeing him) chandler, what are you doing? there is a trash can right there.
well, i thought if i littered, that crying indian might come by and save us.
(finishing removing her bra) okay, there.
thank you phoebe, that is very, very generous.
okay, now let us decide who has the nicest ass.
(opening the door) and there you go!
chandler!!
at least let me smoke it to the good part.
okay. (the car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) oh, no!
what, what is it, what is going on?
yeah, this has happened before.
so you know how to fix it?
yep. put more gas in.
(entering) hey.
well, oh just ah, i was just wondering, when you and i split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of m*a*s*h and half the hostages coming home?
where is ben?
ahh. (notices the table) ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
oh! i thought you guys got married in uh, january?
ah! (realises) oh.
umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘because you know love lasts forever, y'know. nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so rachel and i broke up.
yeah, well.
oh yeah, I would love that.
i guess it all started when rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the table.)
okay, yeah. (to monica and rachel) triple a can pick us up.
great!
yeah, what town are we near?
freemont. west-westmont, ah westburg?
(to monica) then why are you answering? do you at least know what route we are on?
yeah, we are definitely on route 27.
okay. (on phone) we are at a rest stop on route 27. okay. (to rachel) there is no route 27. (listens) (to rachel) okay, either 93 or 76?
i do not know, I am sorry, i always slept in the back when we drove up here.
okay. (on phone) hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) okay! (hangs up) yeah, no they do not do that.
ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
who? i mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? i think we should call ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
no! no, i am not getting in a car with ross, we will just have to live here!
but if...
no you guys, i am not getting in a car with him, you will have to think of something else.
oh good, oh joey and chandler are back.
so the going for help went well?
oh yeah, smokey joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
i have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
then why are you smoking?
well it is very unsettling.
....right? right? i mean it is pretty unbelievable y'know, i mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. y'know i do not, i do not need them, huh, I have got you guys now as friends, you and susan.
(looking at the page) 717? (to carol) where is 717? (he gets up to return the page, carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but ross grabs the last piece.) hey, you have have more of these for susan right?
(answering the phone) (whispering) ross, thank god.
pheebs? what, why are you whispering?
i ate a bug.
(running over to stop rachel) hey rach, the tampons here are only a penny. let us stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)
listen ross, we ran out of gas, and we do not know where we are, so we can not get a tow truck.
oh, now you want a favour?
yes, please.
well, oh, I am sorry your car broke down pheebs, but I am a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
no, I am not going to pick them up.
no, rachel does not want me to....
yeah, you are right.
we were on a break!!! okay!! (grabs the phone) we were, we were..., (calms down) yeah. where are you? I will find you. (hangs up)
oh, you-you are-you are one to talk.
okay, done.
(reading the sign) what is ‘pleh’?
that is ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
huh. what is doofus spelled backwards?
(all excited) op, op, car! car!! (sees it is ross) ugh!!!
oh, it is ross on one of his drives!
hi!
what is he doing here?!
he is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I am stepping on some toes here, in which case i can just mosey on, I have got plenty of people to help on the interstate.
all right!! fine! fine.
arrrghh!!
oh no, now it is not going to make any sense!
(to chandler and monica) you guys, what, what do we do about ross who drove all the way up here? what do we do? just like send him back and we are then going to go skiing?
oh, this is horrible, it is just horrible.
guys, do you think we should ask ross to come along?
i know, what about rachel? i mean how are we even going to ask her?
ask me what?
umm, if ah, it might be okay if ross came skiing?
you guys are unbelievable. no! he cannot come.
excuse me?
it is horrible.
(sarcastic) oh please, can not i come to your special, magical cabin?
why would you even want to come ross? you are a horrible skier.
oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
here we go again.
i-i can not handle this, you guys.
y'know what, i can handle it, handle’s my middle name. actually it is the ah, middle part of my first name.
all right pheebs, your cab’s ready.
all right, let us go!
you are welcome.
oh, I am sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
we were on a break!
y'know ross why do not you put that on your answering machine!
hey-hey, it is valid okay? and I am not the only one who thinks so, monica agrees with me.
(to monica) what?!
(shyly) i do not know.
that is what you said last night.
what i said was, was that i understood. joey’s the one who agreed with you!
okay.
really joey?
(pause) what?
y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
no, i think it is very obvious who is wrong here.
obviously not to joey.
(pause) what?
(to rachel) look both, joey and monica feel the same way that i do. no-no-no-no.
guys, guys, guess who i am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
hey! hey! hey! hey!! hey!!! (they all stop fighting, chandler continues to dance.) look what you are doing to chandler!! (chandler finally stops) (to ross and rachel) yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. okay? (ross starts to leave) you do not, all right you do not have to love each other, okay? you do not, you do not even have to like each other much right now. but please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
yeah, and not put us in the middle.
yeah, otherwise, i mean that is, that is, that is just it for us hanging out together. y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) can you be civil?
yeah.
i can.
okay. good, all right, let us get back in the car, ‘because it is freezing, and my chest is unsupported.
oh what, wait, wait a second, i mean, what are we doing? who is going with who?
look, you guys, you guys should go. (joey tries to say something, but ross cuts him off.) no, I am, you, you planned this all out, and i do not want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
come on man, you drove all the way up here.
no, no, really, I have got to take the car back anyway, I am spending all day tomorrow with ben, it is fine, no guilt i promise.
thank you.
all right, we will call you when we get back.
okay.
maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
okay.
or, or the rodeo!!
that would be great.
okay!
i was being shelly winters from the poseidon adventure.
i know!
bye!!!
(entering) hi! sorry I am late. were you sleeping?
oh, great! listen, oh i had to get you a whole new battery. i got you the best one i could, ‘because that is not where you want to skimp.
yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
okay.
so they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
(outside the door) so I am going to take off then!
...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;
(impressed) wow, that was great! you really wrote that?
(smiling) uh-huh.
(coming from the bedroom) say goodbye elves, I am off to tulsa.
i can not believe you are not going to be here for christmas.
you are really not coming back?
yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. if i do not get it done, I will be fired.
it is so unfair, you do not even like your job!
so, who does?
oh, i like my job.
i *love* my job.
yeah, i can not *wait* to go back to work.
i can not get *enough* dinosaurs!
I am sorry, i will not be here.
it is just... it is hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, i understand.
thanks. (they kiss) I will see you new year's day.
(shocked) you are not going to be here new year's eve??
did i not mention that?
no!
(thinks for a second, then waves his arms, exclaiming:) and to all a good night! (and runs out of the apartment)
all right everybody, i know that it is christmas eve and you would rather be with your families, but there is *no* call (he takes it off) for writing "screw you, mr. bing!" on the back of my chair! (he looks at it) -- by the way, you can all call me chandler.
hey. where have you been?
(to the others) you hear that? you may not be with your families, but at least it is going to smell like ham in here.
y'know what, i know what will cheer you guys up! (he starts spreading envelopes among them) i had a little talk with the boys in new york, told  them about all the hard work you have been doing and that a little christmas bonus may be in order.
well, that is like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!
I am sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
haha, no thanks!
oh, thanks! I am... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional...
so here is a, a very special holiday song that i wrote for some very important people to me. (singing:)
okay, pheebs, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet.
i can save you time ladies, I am right here.
yeah, chandler why do not you take a walk? this does not concern you.
we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
what? that is terrible!
no-no, we do it every year!
oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
no, yeah, we never find them! she is always best at us, that wily... minx.
do not worry, we are just going to search here for an hour, and then we are going to go over to joey's and search, ok?
no not okay, you can not look for monica's presents!
oh no, we have to!
no, you do not have to, and you can not because i, i live here too.
well then, you should look with us.
why?
chandler, are not you worried about what to get monica for christmas?
no, i have a great idea for a present for her.
oh, that is it? (mimics chandler) a great idea! oh yeah.
chandler, that is not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you have just gotten her one great present? i mean that is just going to make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?
if i help, we can find  them faster!
that is right!
ooh ooh, we have a live one!
oh, it is a macy's bag!
oh.
ooh, who is it for?
(reading from a tag that is attached to the shoe) "dear losers, do you really think I would hide presents under the couch? p.s.: chandler, i knew they would break you."
rach, these are for you.
wiper blades. i do not even have a car.
no, but with this new car smell, you will think you do.
ok, pheebs, your turn.
ahh, toilet seat covers! is that what you were doing while i was getting gas?
uh-huh.
you guuuyys.
and for ross, mr. sweet-tooth.
you got me a cola drink?
and, a lemon lime.
well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater.
and last but not least.
they are ribbed for *your* pleasure.
ooh, hey ben, what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
yeah!
come on ben.
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...
(entering in a santa costume) ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!
hey! (grunts as ben hits him at full speed.)
what are you doing here, santa?
well, I am here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
I am the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?
what?
okay ben, why do not you come open some more presents, and santa, the armadillo and i have a little talk in the kitchen? there is a sentence I would never thought I would say.
(to chandler) what are you doing?
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!
thank you, but, but you, you got to leave.
why?
because, I am finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you are-you are wrecking it.
but i did not get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I am sorry chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
fine, I will give the suit back.
(to chandler) hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (she has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling chandler's beard.)
santa? really?
yeah, is that okay?
did your dad ever dress up like santa?
no.
then it is okaaay! (they kiss.)
you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your families. it is bad enough that we are working new year's eve.
did i not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- alright, look, go! go home, okay? merry christmas! go.
good, god's speed, good people! (he starts to close the door, turns around and sees wendy) you are not going to go?
ah. thanks.
ah. (the phone rings; he answers it) chandler bing.
hi honey! we are all here; we just want to wish you a merry christmas.
(simultaneous to the others) ble-blah-blar blargh!
ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!
so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?
ah, well no, it is just uh, me and wendy.
wendy? -- that sounds like a girl's name.
it is. did i... not tell you about her?
umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. where is everybody else?
i sent them home.
ohh, you are such a good boss! is she pretty?
uhh, uh...
(in a low voice) answer faster, answer faster!
i do not know!
(in the same low voice) answer better, answer better!
i do not think of her that way, you know, she is a, she is a colleague.
what does she do there?
oh, she is regional vice president; she is... just below me.
she did what?
be-low me!
ahh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma?
*what*??
well, she... she did not win...
alright, well, maybe i should let you and the second prettiest girl in oklahoma get back to work.
well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she is probably...
(interrupting him) oh chandler, stop talking!
honey, there is really nothing to worry about.
okay.
I am serious!
okay!
merry christmas.
merry christmas.
merry christmas, you guys!
(simultaneous to the others) blah blargah, blar-blab.
(hanging up the phone) the wife says "hi!".
ah well, she is got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is going to happen.
this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you are getting ham on my only tie.
whoa-ho, back off, missy! (he takes a step back, but she still keeps her grip on his tie.)
i do not know; I am not used to girls making passes at me! ... (she let us go of his tie) wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?
(flattered) no,... no... (realizing) no! (he quickly gets several steps away from her.) look, I am, I am married!
I am *happily* married.
right. so, I am sorry...
well look, it is not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she is entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... you know, she is amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she would kick your ass. look, you are a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever going to happen between us.
i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
really?
you kidding? you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms... (she jumps up and kisses him.) (breaking the kiss.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what is going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?
well, not anymore.
but we do not do that.
i know, i just thought it would be fun.
how drunk are you?
drunk enough that i know i want to do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
(thinks) that is the perfect amount!
okay!
(breaking the kiss) y'know what is weird?
what?
this does not feel weird!
i know.
you are a really good kisser.
well, i have kissed over four women. (they kiss again.) do you want to get under the covers?
hm-hmm!
okay!
wow! you are really fast!
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
we are going to see each other naked.
yep!
do you want to do it at the same time?
count of three?
one!
two!
two!
well i think it is safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
eh, we were not that close anyway!
eh! (they start making out again)
so, are you really going to go out with that nurse man?
well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not just goof around with him.
y'know, i do not know if you have ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this.
i think you are better than you think you are.
really? okay, so...
(interrupting) know when to stop.
y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we are okay?
yeah. (they kiss and as she starts to leave, chandler starts to dance. without turning around:) do not do the dance.
right!
i can not get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! (picks up a blue sweater.) okay, here is something, here is something blue and new.
you are so efficient. i love you!
let us go! (starts to leave.)
no-no-no, wait! we need something old!
oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that I have had since i was twelve.
that will work!
i do not think so.
okay, now we just need something borrowed!
(looks around) here just...take this. (hands her the sweater.)
that is stealing!
no, we will-we will bring it back! just put it under your dress.
ohh. (rubs her fake stomach.)
okay, one thing at a time. (they run out to get married.)
listen umm, I have been thinking, it is not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
ehh.
eh, you work for that.
look, i thought about it too, and I am sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
you do?!
yeah, I am putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that is what we are going to do.
oh, you are so sweet. (they hug and kiss.) oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we will pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
you thought about that?
yeah.
how many kids were we going to have?
uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
what else did you think about?
well, stuff like where we would live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we would have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.
(laughs) y'know what? i-i do not want a big, fancy wedding.
sure you do.
no, i want everything that you just said. i want a marriage.
you sure?
uh-hmm.
i love you so much.
i love you. (they kiss.)
(opens her present from ross; it is a dark-red scarf) oohh, i love it!
really? you are not going to return it?
well, not this second!
(at the window) hey look, you guys, it is snowing!
oh wow, it is so beautiful...
wow, it really is!
"wendy" is a fat girl name.
are not we done with that?
okay, fine. let us talk about snow. -- do you think it is snowing in tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
hey!
oh my god...
hey-heeyyy - look at that, it is a christmas miracle!
what are you doing here?
i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much.
hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
monica.
got ya. (blinks an eye)
i never want to leave you again!
but i thought if you left, you get fired.
turns out they can not fire me. because i quit.
what?
what, you, you really quit your job?
yeah! it is a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who does not get to do what he *really* wants to do?
what do you really want to do?
(realizing) i have *not* thought this through!
oh my god!
i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it.
no, i think that this is what you want to do, i think it is great!
thanks!
chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined.
(flattered) ahh...
now give me my real gift.
(to chandler) thank you.
(to monica) here, pass these, will ya.. (points to the others)
oh, hey...
(reading off his card) "a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet." -- how did you know?
wha... are you kidding? i can not return this.
i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys.
mine's is to lilian myers.
i do not have a *job*!
actuary... no. book-keeper... no. topless dancer... (he looks down on himself, checking, then nods satisfied and marks the offer with a pen) (to monica:) hey, d'you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner. *you* are the head of the household. i do not do anything - I am a kept man!
you are! (she picks up a bill from the table, handing it to chandler) hey, here is twenty bucks. -- why do not you go buy yourself something pretty while I am at work tomorrow?
there is nothing to tell! he is just some guy i work with!
c'mon, you are going out with the guy! there is got to be something wrong with him!
all right joey, be nice.  so does he have a hump? a hump and a hairpiece?
wait, does he eat chalk?
just, because, i do not want her to go through what i went through with carl- oh!
okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date. it is just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
sounds like a date to me.
alright, so I am back in high school, I am standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and i realize i am totally naked.
then i look down, and i realize there is a phone... there.
instead of...?
that is right.
never had that dream.
no.
all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. now i do not know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
and they were not looking at you before?!
finally, i figure I would better answer it, and it turns out it is my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
(mortified) hi.
this guy says hello, i want to kill myself.
are you okay, sweetie?
i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
cookie?
(explaining to the others) carol moved her stuff out today.
ohh.
(to ross) let me get you some coffee.
thanks.
ooh! oh! (she starts to pluck at the air just in front of ross.)
no, no do not! stop cleansing my aura! no, just leave my aura alone, okay?
fine!  be murky!
I will be fine, alright? really, everyone. i hope she will be very happy.
no you do not.
no i do not, to hell with her, she left me!
and you never knew she was a lesbian...
no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? she did not know, how should i know?
sometimes i wish i was a lesbian... (they all stare at him.) did i say that out loud?
i told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
oh really, so that hysterical phone call i got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 a.m., "I will never have grandchildren, I will never have grandchildren." was what?  a wrong number?
sorry.
alright ross, look. you are feeling a lot of pain right now. you are angry. you are hurting. can i tell you what the answer is?
strip joint! c'mon, you are single! have some hormones!
i do not want to be single, okay? i just... i just- i just want to be married again!
and i just want a million dollars! (he extends his hand hopefully.)
rachel?!
oh god monica hi! thank god! i just went to your building and you were not there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
(pointing at rachel) de-caff. (to all) okay, everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor. (to rachel) this is everybody, this is chandler, and phoebe, and joey, and- you remember my brother ross?
hi, sure!
hi.
so you want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
oh god... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and i was looking at this gravy boat. this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat. when all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)sweet 'n' lo?- i realized that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry! and then i got really freaked out, and that is when it hit me: how much barry looks like mr. potato head. y'know, i mean, i always knew looked familiar, but... anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering 'why am i doing this, and who am i doing this for?'. (to monica) so anyway i just did not know where to go, and i know that you and i have kind of drifted apart, but you are the only person i knew who lived here in the city.
who was not invited to the wedding.
ooh, i was kind of hoping that would not be an issue... [scene: monica's apartment, everyone is there and watching a spanish soap on tv and are trying to figure out what is going on.]
now I am guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she is really not happy about it.
(imitating the characters) tuna or egg salad?  decide!
(in a deep voice) I will have whatever christine is having.
(on phone) daddy, i just... i can not marry him! I am sorry. i just do not love him. well, it matters to me!
 if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
(re tv) ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
i say push her down the stairs.
c'mon daddy, listen to me! it is like, it is like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you are a shoe! you are a shoe, you are a shoe, you are a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i do not want to be a shoe? what if i want to be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, I am not saying i want you to buy me a hat, I am saying i am a ha- it is a metaphor, daddy!
you can see where he would have trouble.
look daddy, it is my life. well maybe I will just stay here with monica.
well, i guess we have established who is staying here with monica...
well, maybe that is my decision. well, maybe i do not need your money. wait!! wait, i said maybe!!
just breathe, breathe.. that is it. just try to think of nice calm things...
(sings) raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (rachel and monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... la la la la...something and noodles with string.  these are a few...
I am all better now.
(grins and walks to the kitchen and says to chandler and joey.) i helped!
okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? independence. taking control of your life.  the whole, 'hat' thing.
(comforting her) and hey, you need anything, you can always come to joey. me and chandler live across the hall. and he is away a lot.
joey, stop hitting on her! it is her wedding day!
what, like there is a rule or something?
please do not do that again, it is a horrible sound.
oh god, is it 6:30?  buzz him in!
who is paul?
paul the wine guy, paul?
maybe. joey: wait. your 'not a real date' tonight is with paul the wine guy?
he finally asked you out?
yes!
ooh, this is a dear diary moment.
rach, wait, i can cancel...
please, no, go, that would be fine!
(to ross) are, are you okay? i mean, do you want me to stay?
(choked voice) that would be good...
(horrified) really?
(normal voice) no, go on! it is paul the wine guy!
what does that mean?   does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (chandler does not know.)
hi, come in! paul, this is.. (they are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is paul.
I am sorry, i did not catch your name. paul, was it?
okay, umm-umm, I will just--I will be right back, i just got to go ah, go ah...
a wandering?
change!  okay, sit down. (shows paul in) two seconds.
ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes. that can not be good.
 hey, paul!
here is a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
(yelling from the bedroom) shut up, joey!
so rachel, what are you, uh... what are you up to tonight?
well, i was kind of supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
right, you are not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... anyway, if you do not feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
(deadpan) yes, and we are very excited about it.
well actually thanks, but i think I am just going to hang out here tonight.  it is been kind of a long day.
okay, sure.
hey pheebs, you want to help?
oh, i wish i could, but i do not want to.
(singing) love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  la-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) thank you. (sings) la-la-la-la...ohhh!
(squatting and reading the instructions) I am supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and- i cannot feel my legs.
I am thinking we have got a bookcase here.
it is a beautiful thing.
(picking up a leftover part) what is this?
i would have to say that is an 'l'-shaped bracket.
which goes where?
i have no idea.
done with the bookcase!
all finished!
(clutching a beer can and sniffing) this was carol's favorite beer. she always drank it out of the can, i should have known.
hey-hey-hey-hey, if you are going to start with that stuff we are outta here.
yes, please do not spoil all this fun.
ross, let me ask you a question. she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv- what did you get?
you guys.
oh, god.
you got screwed.
oh my god!
oh my god!
my brother's going through that right now, he is such a mess. how did you get through it?
-leg?
you actually broke her watch?  wow!  the worst thing i ever did was, i-i shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
that is right. [scene: monica's apartment, rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]
barry, I am sorry... i am so sorry... i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it is not... it is not, it is about me, and i ju- (she stops talking and dials the phone.) hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs. barry finkel, but it is not me, it is not me.  and not that i have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (the maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
I am divorced!  I am only 26 and I am divorced!
shut up!
you must stop! (chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
that only took me an hour.
look, ross, you got to understand, between us we have not had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento.   you, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we do not do it!  i do not think that was my point!
you know what the scariest part is? what if there is only one woman for everybody, y'know? i mean what if you get one woman- and that is it? unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
what are you talking about? 'one woman'? that is like saying there is only one flavor of ice cream for you. lemme tell you something, ross. there is lots of flavors out there. there is rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing! cherry vanilla. you could get  them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! this is the best thing that ever happened to you! you got married, you were, like, what, eight? welcome back to the world! grab a spoon!
i honestly do not know if I am hungry or horny.
stay out of my freezer! [scene: a restaurant, monica and paul are still eating.]
what?..... what, you want to spell it out with noodles?
oh, so there is going to be a fifth date?
yeah... yeah, i think there is. -what were you going to say?
(spitting out her drink in shock) oh god, oh god, i am sorry... i am so sorry...
i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. um... how long?
wow! I am-I am-I am glad you smashed her watch!
(pause)...yeah. yeah, i do.
oh...see... but joanne loved chachi! that is the difference!
(scornful) grab a spoon. do you know how long it is been since I have grabbed a spoon? do the words 'billy, do not be a hero' mean anything to you?
great story!  but, i uh, i got to go, i got a date with andrea--angela--andrea...  oh man, (looks to chandler)
angela's the screamer, andrea has cats.
right.  thanks.  it is june.  I am outta here. (exits.)
y'know, here is the thing. even if i could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am i going to ask? (he gazes out of the window.)
is not this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life.
that is amazing.
congratulations.
y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there is not anything i can not do.
if can invade poland, there is not anything i can not do.
listen, while you are on a roll, if you feel like you got to make like a western omelet or something... (joey and chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) although actually I am really not that hungry...
(entering, to herself) oh good, lenny and squigy are here.
morning, paul.
hello, paul.
hi, paul, is it?
stop!
we will talk later.
that was not a real date?! what the hell do you do on a real date?
shut up, and put my table back.
all right, kids, i got to get to work. if i do not input those numbers,... it does not make much of a difference...
so, like, you guys all have jobs?
yeah, we all have jobs. see, that is how we buy stuff.
yeah, I am an actor.
wow! would i have seen you in anything?
i doubt it. mostly regional work.
oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the reruns' production of pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
look, it was a job all right?
'look, gippetto, I am a real live boy.'
i will not take this abuse. (walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
you are right, I am sorry. (burst into song and dances out of the door.) "once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
you should both know, that he is a dead man.  oh, chandler? (starts after chandler.)
so how you doing today? did you sleep okay? talk to barry? i can not stop smiling.
i can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
i know, he is just so, so... do you remember you and tony demarco?
oh, yeah.
well, it is like that. with feelings.
oh wow. are you in trouble.
big time!
want a wedding dress?   hardly used.
i think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. okay. okay. i am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. or else I am just going to get up and go to work.
oh, look, wish me luck!
what for?
I am going to go get one of those (thinks) job things.
hey frannie, welcome back! how was florida?
how do you do that?
you know paul?
you mean you know paul like i know paul?
(sitting on the arm of the couch)of course it was a line!
why?! why? why, why would anybody do something like that?
i assume we are looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
i hate men!  i hate men!
oh no, do not hate, you do not want to put that out into the universe.
is it me? is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
all right, c'mere, give me your feet. (she starts massaging them.)
i just thought he was nice, y'know?
(bursts out laughing again) i can not believe you did not know it was a line!
guess what?
you got a job?
are you kidding? I am trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
and yet you are surprisingly upbeat.
you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off!
oh, how well you know me...
they are my new 'i do not need a job, i do not need my parents, I have got great boots' boots!
how did you pay for them?
uh, credit card.
and who pays for that?
um... my... father.
oh god, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  i mean, i can stop charging anytime i want.
c'mon, you can not live off your parents your whole life.
i know that. that is why i was getting married.
give her a break, it is hard being on your own for the first time.
thank you.
you are welcome. i remember when i first came to this city. i was fourteen. my mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i did not know anybody. and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel.
the word you are looking for is 'anyway'...
all right, you ready?
no.  no, no, I am not ready!  how can i be ready?  "hey, rach!  you ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  come on, i can not do this!
you can, i know you can!
i do not think so.
come on, you made coffee!   you can do anything! (chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and joey poured their coffee into it.)
c'mon, cut. cut, cut, cut,...
y'know what?  i think we can just leave it at that.  it is kind of like a symbolic gesture...
 rachel!  that was a library card!
(as rachel is cutting up her cards) y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
welcome to the real world! it sucks. you are going to love it!
well, that is it (to ross) you going to crash on the couch?
no. no, i got to go home sometime.
you be okay?
yeah.
hey mon, look what i just found on the floor. (monica smiles.) what?
that is paul's watch. you just put it back where you found it. oh boy. alright. goodnight, everybody.
mmm. (they both reach for the last cookie) oh, no-
sorry-
no no no, go-
no, you have it, really, i do not want it-
split it?
okay.
okay. (they split it.) you know you probably did not know this, but back in high school, i had a, um, major crush on you.
i knew.
you did! oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother.
i did.
oh. listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out? sometime? maybe?
yeah, maybe...
okay... okay, maybe i will...
goodnight.
goodnight.
see ya.... waitwait, what is with you?
i just grabbed a spoon. (ross exits and monica has no idea what that means.)
i can not believe what I am hearing here.
(sings) i can not believe what I am hearing here...
what? i-i said you had a-
(sings) what i said you had...
(to phoebe) would you stop?
oh, was i doing it again?
i said that you had a nice butt, it is just not a great butt.
oh, you would not know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
there is an image.
(walks up with a pot of coffee) would anybody like more coffee?
did you make it, or are you just serving it?
I am just serving it.
kids, new dream... I am in las vegas. (rachel sits down to hear chandler's dream.)
ugh. (to another customer that is leaving.) excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (hands him the coffee pot.) go ahead. (he does so.) thank you. (to the gang.) sorry.  okay, las vegas.
okay, so, I am in las vegas... I am liza minelli-
pheebs? could you get that? please?
why? just because you are too lazy to get up off your touchie?
no! no! it is just that all the people in the entire world that i want to talk to are right here.
(smiles) okay! (goes to answer the phone.)
(under her breath) sucker!
(answering the phone) hello? (listens) hey joey!
hey pheebs! listen, uh can you do me a favor? i forgot the pin number to my atm card can, can you get it for me?
sure! where is it?
uh, i scratched it on the atm machine down on the corner.
ohh! so you are 5639?!
that is it! thanks pheebs!
(entering) hey!
(to joey) ooh, do you want to talk to chandler?
(to phoebe) is that joey?! (she nods yes) let me talk to him!
no! (she nods no to chandler) because he did not believe in my movie! which is a big mistake because it is real! real!
who was that?
uhh, my stunt double. yeah, and y'know, he is getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
(to phoebe) y'know what? i have been trying to apologize to him all week! if he is not going to let me do it on the phone, I am going to go down there and do it in person.
uhh pheebs, i heard that. can you put him on?
yeah! (she hands the phone to chandler.)
(to joey) hey!
do not come out here!
no-no-no-no, I have supported you one hundred percent and i want to prove that to you in person!
i got that! i forgive ya! do not come out here!
forgive me? you have not been taking my calls in a week!
well, I am totally over it chandler. friends forever! do not come out here!
uh, what was that?
uh, entertainment tonight. [cut to chandler] yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and do not come out here. all right. (hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)
monica! I am sorry I am late! (starts looking around for her) monica? (goes into monica's bedroom.)
(entering) phoebe? (phoebe comes back into the living room) oh, phoebe, I am so sorry. have you been here long?
(saddened) it is okay. what the hell took you so long?
okay, you can not tell chandler. okay? that i ran into richard.
which richard?
the richard.
richard simmons?! oh my god!
noo! my ex-boyfriend richard! y'know the tall guy, moustache?
oh! okay, that actually makes more sense. so how was it?
it was, it was really nice. we started talking and i-i ended up having lunch with him.
that is so weird! i had a dream that you would have lunch with richard.
really?
but again, simmons. go on.
the strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but i did not feel anything at all!
ooh! so now why can not we tell chandler?
because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. i just do not want anything to spoil that.
oh, i can not believe you guys lasted a whole year!
i know.
wow! i owe rachel 20 bucks!
what?
on a totally different bet.
(entering) hey!
it is almost our anniversary!
i know. can you believe it? one year ago today i was just your annoying friend chandler.
awww! now you are just my annoying friend chandler.
huh.
i got you a present!
oh, but it is not 'til tomorrow!
i know, but you have to open it today! (hands it too him.)
okay.
(grabbing the gift from him and opening it) okay! there you go! it is two tickets to vegas!
wow!
for this weekend! oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. we can call it out plane-aversary.
do we have to?
no.
okay this is great, but joey said he did not want any of us out there.
oh, he just does not want us to go through any trouble. think of how excited he will be when we go out and surprise him! plus we get to have our own, ani-vegas-ary! a-nevadaversary!
yeah, i think we should see other people.
but we can go, right?
yes.
okay!
it is a great idea. (they kiss)
okay, I am going to go too!
y'know pheebs, it is kind of our (his and monica's) anniversary.
oh please, you are not going to ditch again like you did with london.
ditch you? phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
uh-huh, great story! I am going!
(entering with ross) hi!
hey!
hey!
hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we are all going to go to las vegas to surprise joey! including me!! you want to go?!
well, i guess i could take a couple days off work.
of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
oh no, wait a minute, wait, I have got a presentation tomorrow. i can not miss that.
oh, but I have got tickets to the van gogh exhibit! I have been waiting like a year for this.
(coughing) art lover!
what did you say?
i said art lover.
is that supposed to be an insult?
i do not know, I am very tired.
so rach, maybe you and i could fly out together saturday.
that sounds great.
yeah? all right I will call the airlines. (picks up the phone and does so)
okay. yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
no! so i can be by myself. y'know? have a little alone time.
naked alone time.
no! phoebe just because I am alone does not mean i want to walk around naked. i mean, you live alone, you do not walk around naked.
uh-huh! why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
so, so far is this trip to vegas better or worse than the trip to london?
so it is pretty much the same pheebs.
okay, what about after i give you these candies? (hands them each one from her purse.)
yeah, i guess it is a little better now.
ah-ha! okay, (takes out a notepad) las vegas 1, london 0! I will be right back. (gets up and heads aft.)
(to monica) happy plane-aversary.
aww! i love you!
can i give you a present now?
okay!
okay! (he grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) oh man! do not tell me i did this!
i love the "i forgot the present" fake out!
how do you feel about the, "i really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
oh that is okay. do not worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
ohh that is the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
(sitting down) oh good! all right, so you decided to tell him about the richard thing.
what-what richard thing?
oh no. [the patented version.]
what richard thing?
(to monica under her breath) simmons! go with simmons!
okay, i umm, i ran into richard yesterday and he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did. the only reason i did not tell you is because i knew you would get mad and i did not want to spoil our anniversary.
(talking out of the side of his mouth) I am not mad.
really?!
oh yeah! yeah, so you-you bumped into richard! you grabbed a bite! it is no big deal. (he still are not happy.)
great!
okay, london 1…
(takes off her robe) oh! look what happened! {do not get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. its times like these i wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than denis franz's butt.} (in her head.) huh, check me out! I am in my kitchen…naked! I am picking up an orange. (does so) I am naked! (goes into the living room) lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (she backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)
(in his head) oh my god! that is rachel naked! i can not look at that! i am looking at this. (looks back at his book.) okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—unless she wants me to be looking at that. she knows I am home. she knows i can see her. what kind of game is she playing? i think maybe someone is lonely tonight. oh-ho, dr. geller! stop it! you are being silly! or, am i?
(singing) love to love ya baby! ow! love to love ya baby! ow! (there is a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) love to love ya, baby! (there is another knock.) darnit! (looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) ugh. (she opens the door to ross who is leaning against the door jam.)
hey.
may i come in?
uh, yeah, if you want too.
do you want me too?
yeah, sure?
so do i. (slowly walks in.) okay rach, before anything happens (he takes off his coat) i just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (turns back to face her.) this is just about tonight. i do not to go through with this if it is going to raise the question of "us." (rachel's confused) okay? i just want this to be (kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (kicks off the other one.)
and um, what-what is that ross?
the physical act of love. (hisses at her.)
(laughs) what?! are you crazy?
oh so-so you were not trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
(gasps) oh god, you saw me?! oh!
you were not trying to entice me with your nakedness.
noo!! no! you thought, you actually thought i wanted to have sex with you?!
no! no! (grabs his coat) no! (grabs a shoe.) no-no-no-no. (grabs the other one and heads for the door.)
ohh wow! I am sorry, but ross you kicked off your shoes!
can we, can we just forget this ever happened?
yes of course, absolutely! you are right. I am sorry.
thank you.
yes.
all right i guess I am, going to go pack. (starts to leave)
okay. oh wait! one more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
hey you guys wait! guys! (catches up to them.) this place is so much better than london! okay? this lady dressed like cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. huh!
phoebe, you do not eat animals.
for 99 cents, I would eat you. (sees the casino) okay, i can totally settle down here. it is got everything i could ever want, including joey! look! (points to joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) oh! look! hi!
oh my god.
hey! joey! (they all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) hey! hey!! wow! (she hugs him.)
hi!
love your condoms my man.
what-what are you guys doing here? i thought i told you not to come.
why are you dressed as a gladiator?
uhh, because I am shooting a scene right now. yeah, i uh, i play a gladiator. uh, y'know what? hold-hold on a second. (to no one in particular) can we cut? yeah, my-my friends are here, I am going to take a little break.
who are you talking too?
they uh director. uhh, her. (points to an old woman standing behind him. who glares at him and walks off.) all right, all right, it is not a gladiator movie. i work here.
why?! what happened?!
well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I am working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
I am so sorry.
look, I am sorry i did not tell ya. (to chandler) I am sorry man.
no-no, that is okay, apparently there is a new policy where we do not have to share everything with everybody.
i knew you were not okay with that.
so you are a gladiator! wow!
yeah, what-what is going on?
monica had lunch with richard.
dawson?!
noo! but that would have been so cool!
no! her boyfriend richard!
it meant nothing! okay? after all this time, how can you not trust me?
when you go lunching with hunky moustache men and do not tell me about it!
you are right. I am sorry. i should have told you.
thanks. (they hug.)
aww, there we go.
i love vegas!
i promise you, next time i will absolutely tell you.
(pushing her away from another hug) next time?
ooh, so close.
there is not going to be a next time! you can not ever see him again!
i can not see him? i mean, you can not tell me what to do!
that is so funny, because i think i just did!
oh y'know what? if you are going to be acting like this all night, i really, i do not even want to be around you.
fine with me!
fine! happy anniversary!
whoa! whoa! guys! please! come on! come on! this is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
no it is not!
what are you talking…
hey-hey do not look at me! i just work here! (walks away.)
(taking off her sweater) okay umm, ross? I am-I am really warm, so I am going to be taking off my sweater. now, I am just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
(sarcastic) yep! that is hilarious!
I am sorry. I am done. I am done.
y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
no, not really. i mean you have seen me naked hundreds of times.
uh-huh. but it was a first for the rest of my building.
okay. all right, that is true! but y'know i just do not embarrass that easily.
what?! you totally get embarrassed!
no, i do not! ross, i think I am just a more secure person than you are.
is that so?
yeah.
(loudly so that everyone can hear) hey lady! i do not care how much you want it! okay?! i am not going to to have sex with you in the bathroom! (rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)
hey, y'know in roman times this was more than just a hat.
really?
yeah, sure! sure! they would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! they would use it to get the mud off their shoe. and sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…
(interrupting in the nick of time) joey, i uh! i can not believe this is how I am spending my anniversary.
all right well, I will take you someplace nice then. look! a guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
whoa!
yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. can you believe that? $5,000!
y'know, if i won $5,000 I would join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit richard from behind with a stick! (mimics it.)
wait a minute! why do not i do what that guy did? I will take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! and then I will turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
good luck!
chandler! i do not need luck. i have thought this through!
i see.
(to the bartender) thank you.
thanks.
i can not believe this! this is like the worst night ever!
y'know monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with chandler. big deal! it is only chandler. (monica turns and stares at her.) i am so sorry.
this is crazy! i mean, it is such a stupid argument. i do not even want to see richard again.
so go fix it! go find chandler! he is probably up in your room! tell him that you are sorry and that you love him.
y'know what? you are right phoebe. you are right. thank you! (gets up to find chandler.)
sure! (when monica gets close to the door.) (yelling) yeah! las vegas, number one!
anybody lose this? (holds up the chip and the woman next to her shakes her head no.)
hmm.
yeah, all right. all right! just keep walkin'! all right?
ross! what are you… I am sorry sir. i just, i think he just really likes you.
(to the guy in the window seat next to him) hey! y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? (he points at rachel.)
what the? what…
(to the flight attendant who appears in record time. it was only seconds after rachel pushed the call button was she there. once again, more proof that tv is not real, irl she would have been waiting for the rest of the flight and by then ross's pants would be dry.) hi!
yes, I am sorry. do you have any extra pants? umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
(to the dealer) can i change a hundred? (he hands him his chip.)
(betting all 100) let us ride.
hit me! (he does so.) ohh man! (joey busts and loses all the money, but when the dealer starts to collect the cards joey notices something.) wait! (he holds his hand next to the dealer's hand.)
chandler! you are not going to believe this! i have found my identical hand twin!
(totally confused) what?
my identical hand twin!
what is an identical hand twin?
what is it sound like? it is a guy with my identical hands! it was incredible! chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! it-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
are you sure you were not (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
do not you see what this means?! i can forget about that stupid movie. I am going to be a millionaire!
(totally confused) how?
look, i do not have it all worked out yet, but it is got to mean big money! come on! identical hands!
again i must go back to, how?
this is vegas man! people will pay to see freaky stuff! okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (holds up his left hand) twice? huh?
(pause) y'know, i-i can not really put a price on that joe.
hey, are you unsupporting me again?
no! no! i support you 100%! i just did not, i did not get it right away. y'know now I am caught up! identical hand twins! it is a million-dollar idea!
hey!
pheebs!!
yeah?
i found my identical hand twin!
ohh, you are so lucky! (to chandler) hey! so, where is monica? did you guys make up?
no!
but she just came up here!
that was joey!
i wonder where she is. that is so weird.
yeah, well, she is probably talking to richard.
would you stop that! do you want to know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with richard? she did not feel anything for him. she loves you!
really?
yes! now, she feels terrible! she really wants to make up! you got to find her.
okay. (he gets up and goes to find her.)
good. (after he leaves, she puts on joey's gladiator helmet and checks herself out in the mirror) i should really start wearing hats!
yes, i did. thank you very much, it was excellent. (disembarks)
ohh, it was the best!
i think the check in is that way. (points)
ahh.
hello! (she makes a face and the kid laughs harder. finally, his parents drag him off.) ohh, kids love me.
(sees ross and rachel) hey!
phoebe! (they hug.)
you guys are here! yay!
hi! (hugs phoebe)
(sees rachel's face) what? did you go to a costume party? let me guess umm pancho vila? (points at rachel) and you are bob saget. (an old lady has sat down at the slot machine phoebe was just at.)
pancho vila?
yeah! (motions to her face, indicating all of rachel's "make-up.")
what are you talking about pheebs? (takes out her compact) i do not… (she gasps when she looks in the mirror and sees her face.) (to ross) oh my god, you drew on me?!
hey, you wet my pants!
whoa, what kind of party was this?
ross, i have been walking around like this since the plane! i can—you have so crossed a line. (heads for the bathroom)
rach! wait! the men's room is that way. (points in the other direction. rachel hits him with her purse and heads for the ladies room.)
ugh!
what?
that is like the third time that lady's won on a machine i was playing.
oooohhh, I will bet she is one of those people.
m-m-mole people?
what? no-no, a lurker.
oh. what is a lurker?
okay when you are playing a machine and it has not paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…
kills you?
no. they swoop in and steal your jackpot.
ohhh!
uh-hmm.
how do you know about this?
my nana used to do it. that is how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.
dance karate?
yes, it is a deadly but beautiful sport. (does a karate chop, then does a little dance-type sway.)
(returning with her purse covering her face) all right, it will not come off!
what?!
it will not come off!
oh my god! rach-rach, are-are-are you sure?
no, actually i took it off then i drew it back on.
(entering) hey-hey-hey you made it!
joey!!
all right! hey-hey!
hi!!
who is your friend? he is hot! (ross laughs and rachel smacks him with her purse.)
(to joey) thanks man.
hi. (she hugs joey.)
hey listen i uh, talked to chandler, sorry about the movie.
no, do not be sorry. i do not need it anymore. i found my identical hand twin!
your what?
my identical hand twin! the person whose hands are exactly like mine! this thing is a gold mine!
what?! that is not going to make you any money!
okay. well, if that is how you feel about it, fine! none of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! except uh, you pheebs. you can live in the thumb.
all right baby, come on! (rolls the dice) yes! yes! i am on fire!
(walking by with his luggage) see you later mon.
wait chandler, what are you doing?!
what does it look like? I am going home.
what? wait! why? (he turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) chandler! chandler! wait! I am sorry, i was just playing for one second! i was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you do not want me to see richard again, i will not! he means nothing to me!
come on! i was there! (he is propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. he winces and pulls his hand away.) i know he is the love of your life.
not any more.
really?!
really! (they hug and kiss) all right? let us forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (she picks up his suitcase.) okay, this is empty.
yeah, i wanted to make a dramatic scene, but i hate packing.
(entering) uhh, hey. where is the other guy?
he is kind of tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. (holds up his hand.) see?
okay! (walks away, then turns back.) how you doing?
right! okay. (heads for the bathroom.)
(on the phone) yes, hello. i have a question. umm, i used your pen to draw on my friend's face. (listens) a beard and a moustache. (listens and laughs) thank you. (rachel turns around and glares at him.) no, she did not think so. (listens) i know it is like (turns and sees rachel staring at him and quickly changes the subject) anyway, umm well make-up did not cover it and we have tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. what-what do we do? (listens) yeah. (listens) uh-huh. (listens) yeah. (listens) oh! okay. (listens) okay, thank you! (rachel gets excited at his tone.) (hangs up the phone) yeah, it is not coming off.
what?! what else did he say?
umm, he said he thought i was funny. so…(rachel stares at him.) okay, look-look umm, let us just go downstairs, we will have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
ross, no! there is no way i am leaving this room looking like this!
oh, come on! rach, it is-it is not that bad.
ross, i am a human doodle!!
look, just because some idiot drew on your face does not mean you should not have any fun! okay? and besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even going to look at you. okay? this is vegas! hello! there are tons of other freaks here! (rachel turns around and glares at him.) there are tons…of…freaks here. no other. no. come on! no one will notice, i swear!
okay, there was some staring and pointing.
okay, i need a, i need a drink! (makes a beeline for the mini-bar.)
oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff. (rachel glares at him.) but who cares?! because it is all on me! (rachel reaches into the fridge and pulls out two handfuls of those mini booze bottles.) (watching her.) that is, one big drink!
(she is finished reliving the fridge of its entire alcohol content.) macadamia nut?
(looking at the price list) umm… wow! that is-that is some pricey nut!
hm-mmm! (opens the container)
really like those macadamia nuts, huh?
nope! (she puts one in her mouth and spits it out, then does it again in another direction.)
(seeing her) get out of here you lurker! (she does not move) go on! get! (she throws a quarter at her.)
(arm-in-arm with monica) hey pheebs!
ohh! you made up!
yeah, i could not be mad at him for too long.
yeah, she could not live without the chan love. (they start kissing.)
ohh, get a room.

i know. use it.
oh-oh-oh, yeah! (he grabs some towels and takes them to him.) that is right, you take good care of those babies!
it is me, joey!
(holds up his hand) joey!
okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
look, you and i have been given a gift. okay? we have to do something with it. like-like, hand modeling! huh? or-or magic! and you know nasa's going to want to talk to us!
(stopping him) whoa! whoa! whoa! whoa-whoa! we could have our own show! y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! huh? and-and-and i wrote a song for us! (singing, to the tune of this land is your land) this hand is your hand! this hand is my hand! oh wait, that is your hand! no wait, it is my hand!
(following him) but you have not even heard the chorus!
oh my god, I am starting to look like my great aunt, muriel.
(gets up) all right. y'know what? we do not have to go downstairs! we can bring vegas up to us! (he grabs a deck of cards and pulls up a chair.) all right, come on, come on, we will play some blackjack. here we go. (deals the cards.) 13.

I have never loved anybody as much as i love you.

okay!
okay! come on! let us go! all right!
(spots one) okay! that is a four! and where-where is the other one?
nobody move! (to chandler) okay, you look that way; I will look this way!
all right!
here it is! here it is!
that could be a four or a five. it is your call.
it is a four.
i think so too.
oh well, lost again. (she gets up and slowly moves away. the lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) that is it! you and me, outside!
be cool! (they both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) okay lady, your lurking days are over!
yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I am going to lurk first! you move on to someone else, I am going to be one step ahead of you, every single time! and then I will be on your ass every hour of every day 'til monday, because that is when i go home. when do you leave?
what time? maybe we can share a cab!
hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (he does so.) hit me. (she slows down with each one.)
(runs out of cards) we need more cards.
yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. hold on a second. (gets up but stumbles a little bit.) whup, okay. (she makes it to the phone and picks it up, without dialing.) hello! vegas? yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? we would like some more beers. hello? ohh, i forgot to dial!
that must be our alcohol and beers! (gets up to answer it.)
hey!
ohh, it is joey! i love joey! (hugs him.)
ohh, i love joey! joey lives with a duck! (goes and hugs joey.)
hi!
hey!
look-look-look you guys, i need some help! okay? someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
I will do it. hey, whatever you need me to do, I am your man. (he starts to sit down on the bed. there is one problem though, he is about two feet to the left of it. needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (looking up at joey.) whoa-oh-whoa! are you, are you okay?
yeah! I am fine! thanks! (he starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) hey rach, how you doing?
I am doing good, baby. how you doing?
ross, do not let her drink anymore! (exits)
ohh, here is that macadamia nut!
ohhh!!
(he puts it in his mouth) nope! something else. (throws it back under the bed.)
oops! all right, so what do you want to do now?
i want to get out of the room! y'know, i…i really miss downstairs.
okay, y'know what? there is only one way I am leaving this hotel room.
well hello! I am ross!
good luck to ya!
excuse me sir, you have got a little something right here. (he points to the corner of his mouth and they both laugh.)
wow!
(bowing) hello!
(bowing) hello!
i won! i won! i finally won!
fine! here! take a hike toots! (gives back her quarter.)
(quietly) sells drugs to kids.
she sells drugs to kids. (the guard looks at the lurker.)
how about we talk about this over dinner?
no! no, you can not arrest me! no!! i will not go back! i will not go back to that hell hole!!
oh, okay. (walks out.)
okay, come on, i can not get married until i get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
okay, all right, all right, all right! okay! (picks up a blue sweater.) okay, here is something, here is something blue and new.
you are so efficient. i love you!
let us go! (starts to leave.)
no-no-no! we need something old!
ohh, great, i have condom in my wallet I have had since i was twelve.
that will work!
i do not think so.
okay, now we just need something borrowed!
(looks around) here just…take this. (hands her the sweater.)
that is stealing!
no, we will-we will bring it back! just put it under your dress.
ohh. (rubs her fake stomach.)
okay, one thing at a time. (they run out to get married.)
(sitting down) ahhh! (slides his hands across the table.)
no-no, i do not really have any money. not yet, anyway… (shakes his hands.)
(throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {y'know, looking at it now, they really do not have that similar of hands. joey's are bigger.}) ooh-ho-ho! (the dealer stares at him and he stops.)
(entering and sitting down at the table.) hello. my name is regina phalange. I am a businesswoman in town on business. would you like to see my card? (looks down) ooh, what did i do with my file-a-facts? i must have left it in conference room b.
hit me! (he does so.)
oh my god! may i just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! they are identical! now, I have never seen anything like that in the business world.
uhh, ms. phalange, may i ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?
would not you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?
no, you threw out phoebe. I am ms. regina phalange. phalange!
me?! oh come on, man! you can not do this! come on! (being dragged out by the guard) I am your hand twin!!
hello! one marriage please!
yep, we want to get married!
(singing) dum! dum-dum-dum! dum! dum! dum! dum-dum-dum!
what are you doing?
oh, that is the wedding march. does, does that freak you out?
no, only because that is the graduation song.
okay! (stands up) this is it! (claps his hands) we are going to get married!
are you sure you want to do this?
well, hello, mrs. ross! (throws some rice.)
well, hello, mr. rachel! (throws some more rice.)
wait! (gets her bearings) okay!
it is so weird, how did joey end up kissing charlie last night? i thought you would end up kissing charlie.
hey, i thought I would end up kissing charlie too ok? but surprise!
i missed most of the party (pause) charlie's a girl, right?
yes, she is this new professor of my department that i did not kiss.
i do not know why joey had to kiss her! i mean, of all the girls at the party, god!
why do you care so much?
yes rachel, why do you care so much?
(worried) be-because ross is the father of my child! you know... and i... want him to hook up with lots of women! (pause) i just... all I am saying is... i do not think that joey and charlie have anything in common.
oh, i do not know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
wow, joey and a professor! can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism... oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
all right, so... ross, you are ok with all this? i mean...
yeah, it is no big deal. i mean, i just met her and I am fine with it...
oh, god. i forgot how hot she was!
hey!
I am going to get some more coffee.
ok. (they both go)
(to joey) so, a professor, uh?
yeah! she is cool, and she is so smart! her mind is totally acrimonious (which, being joey, he mispronounces "amonious"). (pause) that is not how she used it...?
uhm no! think less of you! no, i do not think less of you. i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. i mean, those people who like someone and do not kiss them... those-those people are stupid, i hate those people.
yeah, i know the type.
hey, if you want to grab a bite before work we would better get acrimonious. no? am i getting close?
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey you guys! look what i just got. (she shows them a pair of slippers)
oh, oh! wow, i love those! where did you get them?
i bought them off ebay! they used to belong to the late shania twain.
(after a pause) phoebe, shania twain is still alive!
oh... then i overpaid. (she goes to the bathroom)
hey, what is this?
oh, it is a gift certificate to this new spa in soho.
oh, you can not show phoebe this! she hates those corporate massage chains.
ah, why, now i can not get a massage? there are so many things that she disapproves of! i can not eat veal, i can not wear fur, i can not go hunting...
do you want to go hunting?
well, i would like to have the option!!
(coming back from the bathroom) what is up? (she sees the gift certificate in rachel's hands) hey, rachel!!
oh!
no, you can not go there! you know how i feel about these "big massage places"! they are putting people like me out of business!
and she wants to go hunting, too!!
phoebe, come on, i do not want to waste it! it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
ok, this is not about the money, ok? it is about... it is about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
i do not care about any of that!!
well, do you care about friendship?
oh!
i feel really strongly about this, rachel. please, do not use this gift certificate. I am asking you as a friend.
oh, not as a friend, phoebe!! fine, i will not use it!
promise?
i promise.
thank you. (she tears up the gift certificate)
but i am going hunting!!
(entering) hey honey! i missed you today!
oh, yeah?
yeah. (they kiss) what d'you want to do tonight?
oh, well... maybe we could... (he sweeps the stuff off the table and wordlessly invites monica to have sex on it)
ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? know your audience! besides, tomorrow we are doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
we really need to take those tests?
honey, we have been trying to have a baby for over a year. i think it is a good idea to find out if everything's ok. just a few routine tests.
but i do not want to do it in a cup!
what is the big deal?
it is weird! in a doctor's office?
it is not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell?
(embarrassed) i cannot believe ross told you that! (pause) and in my defense, it was a wendy's!
look, i do not want to do this test either, but i really do think it is a good idea!
yeah, ok. I am sure that doctor's office can not be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory!
(really embarrassed) oh!
oh, yeah! rachel talks too!
(sipping red wine from a glass) who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
heeey!
come on in, how are ya?
can i offer you a drink?
uh-oh. i hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today i had to open a door and go (looking scared) ohhhh!
hey, if you need a tour guide... (point to himself)
yeah, definitely, definitely. ok, what do you want to see first?
(looking puzzled and nodding) ok!
i know, yeah!
ok, let me stop you right there. the mets suck, ok? you want to see the yankees.
which one, they all suck!
(looking puzzled) i do not think so.
(to the receptionist) hi there!
oh, hi. i have a massage appointment under rachel green, and here is my gift certificate.
and... taped back together.
ok
(imitating the receptionist's tone) through the glass doors.
alright-y then.
ok. do we have to talk like that then they are not around? (she sees rachel) oh, no, no! listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
but that woman can not know i work here. she is a friend of mine and i made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
because it is good money! but that does not change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
(watching around and whispering) ok, are they listening?
ross!
hi!
i need to talk to you about charlie.
(annoyed) oh, do you, do you really?
yeah, I am... I am kind of having a little problem.
look, if you do not know what the word "acrimonious" means, just do not use it!
no, look, you know charlie, right? she is cool, she is funny, her body is soo...
get to the problem!
yes. it is just that she is so much smarter than all the girls I have ever dated! combined! i do not want her to think I am stupid!
(looking down) are you wearing two belts?
(checking) eh, what do you know!
you were saying you did not want to seem stupid.
right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and i do not know how to talk about that stuff. you got to help me out!
you know, i really do not want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
please, c'mon, you are the smartest person i know and i really like this girl, ok, i do not want to lose her.
(after a short hesitation) fine.
thanks.
ok. let us see. oh, you should take her to the met!
the metsss!
oh, no! the met! the metropolitan museum of art.
(realizing) oh, that is what she meant! (pause) you know, if they are going to shorten it, they should call it the muse! you know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
yeah, most of it it is a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
ok, all right, so I will take her to the met.
yeah, uh, uh, ok, there is this great rare bookstore on madison avenue. you know what? she loves architecture, you know what you should do? you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there is this great little pastry shop that she would love.
geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
but I am not! (pause). you know what if you are in the mood for thai food...
whoa, whoa, whoa! slow down, you go way too fast. ok? just go back to the met, ok?
ok.
you got to tell me exactly what to do there.
ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that is the antiquities wing. ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! so, i walk in the door and make the right (and he bends his arm to the left. ross then bends joey's arm to the right and joey nods)
i have a weird feeling about this place. (pause) how do i know that they are not going to secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
because, honey, i mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is going to want to watch that.
deposit my specimen? you know, usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. thanks, got it.
hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you are going to be ok?
yeah, i guess!
i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! no one here even knows you!
oh, come on!
hey, we are probably fertile, let us go home!
why are you here?
(to heaven) no no no... i mean, why? why is she here??
what!?
this was fun! but I have got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! (leaves)
I would love to stay, but i have eh... (points at the cup) got a hot date... (starts to leave)
(disgusted) i think it just fell off. (leaves)
(in a strange heavy accent) hello "ja", it is time for your massage, ja! put your face in the hole.
wow, a swedish massage from a real swedish person. (puts her head in the hole and phoebe enters)
okay, then I am swedish...
so, what is your name?
it is a normal swedish name... ikea...
oh... what an interesting name.
ja!
you know i... (lifts her head and tries to look in phoebe's direction)
(pushes her head back down) time for your scalp massage!
(sees phoebe's slippers through the hole) wow... i really love your... (startled as she realizes those are phoebe's slippers)
is something wrong?
no, it is just that uhm... it feels so good... ikea... (pause) yeah, say hey, you will know this, what is the capital of sweden?
(thinks for a few moments) uhm... stockholm.
damn! i wish i knew if that was right!
(gesturing at an imaginary painting) note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
now, do you have any idea what you just said?
(shaking his head as if to say: of course not!) no, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, monet is not spelt m-of-n-a-y. i just... i wrote that out phonetically for you.
phonetically? (looks confused)
yeah, yeah that means... you know? we just... we do not have time for this.
ok.
ok, but you know what? i got to say, I am really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
ah! I am an actor! i can memorize anything! last week on "days" i had to say "frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
wow. what does that mean?
no idea! but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means "you are going to get eaten by a bear".
ok! so let us move on to the renaissance?
ok, caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. touch it, it is really bumpy! (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting).
nah ah! nah ah! (stops him form doing so) no no no! no ad-libbing and dude, you can not touch the paintings.
come on! you... (reaches out to touch the imaginary painting again)
no! (slaps his hand)
(to the nurse at the nurses' station) my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there. really helped speed the process along! (walks towards the common area and sees janice is still there) janice! you are not... gone?
yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!
i have not... i have not even thought about the results yet... i just assumed that everything was going to be ok.
(slightly panicky) yeah, but what if it is not? what if there is a reason why we can not have a baby?
(smiling again) oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can not believe i did not even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
(stares at her intently, then yells) it was a "wendy's!! "
(singing) "ipan stripan, glupi glabi! " and that is the swedish national anthem! thank you for asking! (looks annoyed)
wow, ikea... what a rich culture. uhm, you know what? i have a friend who is a masseuse.
oh, ja! ja!
yah! she is... uhm... not very good though... (phoebe looks devastated)
uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
i do not know... maybe it is because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you are such a high maintenance tight ass!
(now lifts her head) phoebe!!
you know it is me?
for like a half an hour! man, you can lie about sweden!
how can you come here?
how could you not tell me you worked here?
i do not have to tell you everything!
yes you do, if you are going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
tips not included.
oh! phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
because i was ashamed ok? i sold out for the cash! and then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401k. but you know... you pay a price. now I am this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh! paying taxes!
phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! be true to what you believe in! honey, you have principles and i so admire that! i do not have any!
you know what? you are right. i am going to quit. it is time i took my life back!
good for you pheebs!
ok.
okay (walks out and closes the door behind her, looks up and whispers) if you guys have microphones in there too, i did not mean any of that. i love you.
haha! got ya! die, die, die!
(recovers his composure and starts typing) respectfully, professor r. geller. (hits <return>, closes the laptop and joins charlie on the sofa) hey!
hey, how was the met?
yeah? joey really knows his art, huh?
what do you mean?
(perplexed for a moment) wait a minute... when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?
(shaking head) oh joey, joey! but still, i mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
what?
what, i mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
(slowly) yeah. but you know what? i think you should give joey a chance. i mean, he is a great guy, and sure he does not know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
and if you think about it, i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. you know, that is the kind of guy joey is.
that was going to be my next argument.
hey!
hey!
(to charlie) you are ready?
(aside, to ross) hey ross! that art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
glad i could help man.
although some of that stuff was not where you said it was going to be, but... (confidently) i made it work.
(picking up a plastic cup similar to the one he deposited his specimen in) it is not okay that I am aroused by this now.
hello? oh hi, doctor connelly. (pause) no, she is not here but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this? (his smile fades as he hears the answer) oh. (pause) well, so what does that mean? (pause) ok. ok, thank you. thanks. (hangs up)
hey sweetie.
doctor connelly just called.
with good news? (very quickly and wringing hands) of course it is not good news, you just said (deadpan) "doctor connelly just called". if it was good news you would have said (excitedly) "doctor connelly just called! " but so what is it? is there a problem, uh? is there a problem with me or with you?
actually it is both of us.
what?
apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
oh... what does that mean?
it means that my guys will not get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. (pause) it means...
chandler?
(seriously) it means that we can keep trying, but there is a good chance this may never happen for us.
(weeping) oh my god!
I am sorry.
I am sorry too.
well, we are going to... we are going to figure this out.
(still weeping) i know.
(imitating the receptionist's tone) good morning receptionist.
rachel green? (angrily) son of a bitch, she came back?
(through the door, with a scottish accent) are you ready for your scottish massage? put your face in the hole, lassy.
hey.
hey.
oh my god! you cleaned! (gasps) look at these floors! you did the windows! oh, i have been begging you for months and you did! you cleaned! and nagging works!
y’know uh, i did not actually do this.
oh no, was i cleaning in my sleep again?
no, it was not you.
well then who?
i got a maid. yay!
(shocked) i hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…
uh honey, i know you do not like to relinquish control…
oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
look, she is really nice. okay? and she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
did she really say that?
yes, i distinctly remember ‘because i thought it was a joke. now just give her a chance, okay?
fine, i can do it. (gets anxious.) whew.
what is the matter?
well, usually when I am this anxious, i clean!
(looking around) who is cell phone is that? it is just so annoying; everywhere you go.
i think it is coming from your bag.
(checks) i never get calls!! (answers the phone) hello?
oh my god eric hi! wait, how did you get this number?
wow! what an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
oh you did? (to rachel) he did it! he did it!
wow! what did he do?
shhh! I am talking.
are you asking me out? ‘because it would be kind of weird since you just broke up with my sister.
no! wait! i was just saying that so you would think i was a good person. fight for me.
not great, but we can work on it at lunch. okay, i can be at your apartment in two hours.
I have got friends too. okay, bye.
oh my god! I am going out with eric! ooh, this day is really going to be so much better than i thought it was going to be. oh ross, i can not make lunch. (exits.)
so apparently I am available for lunch.
i can not. I am busy. I am apartment hunting.
you are moving?
yeah, i can not live with joey once the baby comes. i do not want my child’s first words to be, (in a baby’s voice) "how you doing?"
so does-does joey know you are moving?
well, i have not discussed it with him yet, but i know he is going to be relieved. last week, he brought this girl over and i started talking to her about morning sickness and then i showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
that is not really porn.
not so much.
hey, y’know what and if you are looking for a place? i just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
oh my god! was she old? does she have a view?
well i do not know, but how-how great would that be huh? you living in my building. i could help take care of the baby. i can come over whenever i want. (rachel looks at him.) with your permission.
yeah that would really be great.
yeah.
well can we see it?! oh maybe we should not. i mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
yeah. no. no you are right.
shall we?
yeah.
hi. I am ross geller. i live in the building.
and I am rachel, an admirer of the building.
i-i heard about mrs. verhoeven passing away and I am so sorry for your loss.
what?
oh, thank god!
ahh.
of course! uh yeah, she and i would talk all the time in-in (rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (pushes rachel out of the way.)
y’know i would it is just painful.
so she is really not dead.
hmm. do you think—could you tell me if she is hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
oh well umm, i make it myself! it is two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. and now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? we just met.
(to chandler) i love her.
okay. (as brenda exits monica notices something.)
see? i told you.
she stole my jeans!
(pause) what?
i have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
so she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
do not you see? it is the perfect crime!
she must have been planning this for years!
i will prove it to you! okay? about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain!
honey, is not it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
i guess.
so, should not we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?
fine. I am just glad i did not give her my secret ingredient.
out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
yeah! (laughs.)
hi!
yeah, me too. not in the shaky angry way you are though.
oh.
yeah. (covers her face with her hand.) yeah.
maybe this is too weird.
no do not tear out your eyes!!
oh, yeah try that. (he finishes and looks at her.) so, is that better?
look eric, turn around. (he does so.) look, i like you, but it should not be this hard. y’know? this is our first date y’know? first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(he kisses her)…second kisses. (motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)
thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, gunter. (he translates that phrase into dutch.)
yeah, we are done.
ezel? ezel? ezel? (looks it up in his book.)
(entering) hey ross! listen, do you want to go see that new imax movie on tide pools?
really?!
(laughs) no. but i got knicks tickets for you, me, and chandler.
sweet!
all right, well finish your coffee; let us go.
okay i-i just have to stop by my place first.
to tape the game? you do this every time ross, you are not going to be on tv!
no-no, i-i have to see if this apartment became available.
oh, you are switching apartments?
it is not for me, it is for rachel.
but rachel has an apartment.
yeah, but when the baby comes she is going to want to move.
she is?
yeah, you did not expect her to live there with a baby did you?
i guess i did not really think about it.
(finds the word in the book) ezel! (reads the translation.) hey gunther! you are an ezel!
damnit!
nice jeans!
oh. (holds on to it.) (to herself) you are not gettin’ it.
oh, i fell asleep.
oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? that will really work up your appetite for lunch.
hello.
I am sorry. I have never had a maid before, is this not okay?
hey!
hey!
how was the game?
oh, okay. i…i ate way too much.
oh.
ooh. (notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) so umm, i was talkin’ to ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
oh yeah! hopefully across the street if certain dutch people would just let go.
i was kind of hoping you would stay.
oh but joey, i have to go. there is no room for a baby here.
no room? it is a baby. it is like this big. (holds his hands about a foot apart.) y’know, i mean you-you could you could put it over here. (a desk.) or-or-or we could put it right here. (the chair.) aw, it is cute, right? or-or we could put it over here. (by the bathroom door.) you would not even notice it. where is the baby? (mumbles that it is over in the corner.)
honey, it is not just a matter of where you put it. i mean a baby changes everything. they cry all the time. i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there is a screaming baby around.
i could use a challenge! it is getting pretty easy.
honey, it is so sweet that you want me to stay, but i-i can not do that to you. i mean it would disrupt your entire life.
i love living with you so much. i just wish things did not have to change.
i know.
y’know i blame ross for this.
i do too a little bit.
I am going to miss you, you are the hottest roommate i ever had.
ooh, oh no! i have to go! i have a massage appointment.
no, i got in trouble for that before. I will see you later.
really? that is the thing I am worse at! you will see. (exits.)
(entering) hi!
hey! umm, i think brenda needs a raise.
how come?
because i put my head between her legs.
to see her pants?
they are my pants!
are you sure? did you see the stain?
no! i was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
god! she is not stealing from us! okay, will you let this go?
fine. (brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) she is wearing my bra!
oh dear god!
my pink flowered bra! i recognize the strap!
and yet you do not recognize that you are crazy.
here is the plan! okay? I am going to leave you get a look at brenda’s bra!
here is another plan…no!
i would do it but she thinks I am attracted to her!
why?
did you not hear where my head was? come on! come on we are a team! we are in this together!
i fear a jury will see it the same way!
do this for me! come on, i catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!
you see that?
do you see this? (mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.)
all right. yes. okay. i get your point. but if it is not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
yes! absolutely. okay? look, you will know it is mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there is a very noticeable rip.
you need new clothes.
hi. how is she?
(happily) oh. (realizes then sadly) oh. well i uh, i brought her some bloemen. (flowers in dutch.)
oh i do not know that it would.
all right then. (follows her in and checks the place out.)
(entering) hey!
hey! (jumps on the bed with him.) can we pick up where we left off?
why?
what sex?
we did not have sex.
(simultaneously as eric) ew! ew! ew! ew! ew! ew!
you-you…you had sex with ursula?!
you did not notice she was wearing different clothes?!
oh. ew! ew! ew! ugh! y’know what? this is too weird.
so i guess this is it.
yeah, so do you.
I am leaning. this is where i lean.
brenda a bee!
yes! it is flown into your blouse and you would better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
you do?
i totally understand. (they both laugh.) can i just see your bra?
hi!
(looking at rachel’s jeans) where did you get those jeans?!
you gave them to me!
no i did not!
all right, i took them. but i figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
oh no! did you take my bra too?!
what bra?
the pink one with the flowers?!
you mean the one that you are wearing? (adjusts monica’s pink bra strap as monica looks down her shirt.)
sounds about right.
what is this?
hey! uh, this is just to give you an idea. okay well, we can put screens here, (in front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. and uh—oh look! here is a baby monitor (holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. huh?
you are so sweet. (notices something in the crib.) oh my god! and you gave the baby hugsy! (a stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)
ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. that-that-that is really just to show where the baby would go. y’know why do not i hold on to him so that there is no confusion? (takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)
but joey the baby is going to be crying, it is going to be loud.
I am loud!
it is going to be up all night!
I am up all night!
it is going to poop!
hello!
what about all the women you want to bring home?
look, if I am bringing home a woman who can not stand being around a baby, then maybe i do not want to be with that woman! or maybe we will just do it in the bathroom of the club!
joey, are you sure?
yeah! all right—look, i know sometimes it will be hard, okay? but, it will also be really…really great. please rachel! i-i-i really want you to stay.
i want me to stay too.
ohh!
thank you. (they hug.) oh joey and look at this crib! it is so cute!
i know! i found it on the street.
are you serious—really?! it is in such good condition.
yeah.
wow! whoa-whoa what is under the covers?
i do not know.
it is moving.
ew.
it is still—(screams)—it is got a tail! get it out of here! get it out of here!!
ooh! ah! okay! (quickly drags the crib outside.)
well, the old lady died. and how do i know? her dying wish was for one last kiss. but i do not care, (to rachel) because you got the apartment. yes!
ewww. yeah. umm. i think I am going to stay here.
is not that great?
(stutters looking for words) ezels!!
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey-hey-hey. so what happened? a forest tick you off?
no. y'know how we are always saying we need a place for the mail.
yeah!
well, i started building one. but then i decided to take it to the next step.
you are building a post office?
no, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. it is a one day job, max.
okay. (notices that joey is wearing some really tight jeans) my word! those are snug.
oh yeah. these are my old work pants, sergio valente’s.
power saw kind of got away from me there.
(joining phoebe outside) hey pheebs.
hey!
any sign of your brother?
no, but he is always late.
i thought you only met him once?
yeah, i did. i think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘frank’s always late.’
well relax, he will be here.
no, i know, I am just nervous. y'know it is just y'know mom’s dead, do not talk to my sister, grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. it is like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kind of thing. you are so sweet to wait with me.
well, actually gunther sent me. you are not allowed to have cups out here, it is a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)
does anyone else think david copperfield is cute?
no, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
all right, janice, likes him. in fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
her what?
well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can not get mad.
ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
so, chandler, who is on your list?
ah, kim basinger, cindy crawford, halle berry, yasmine bleeth, and ah, jessica rabbit.
now, you do realize that she is a cartoon, and way out of your league?
i know, i know, i just always wondered if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
hey, monica, who would yours be?
first, i need a boyfriend, then i can have a list.
it is just a game mon. (makes a ‘can-you-believe-her’ face to the rest of the gang.) rach, how about you?
oh, i do not know, i guess, chris of’donnel, john f. kennedy, jr., daniel day lewis, sting, and parker stevenson.
spiderman?
hardy boy.
peter parker.
thank you.
what about you honey, who would be on your list?
well i-i-i, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. first, I will divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
(coughing) what a geek!
(entering) everbody this is frank! this is my half-brother frank.
this is everybody. this is ross.
hey.
chandler.
hi.
joey.
hey-hey!
this is monica.
and this is rachel.
hi!
I am going to get coffee.
we do not, really.
well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
oh yeah! yeah, no, we are going to connect, y'know bond, and everything.
you know, we do not really take advantage of living in the city.
i know.
oh, I am sorry. did i get ‘ya?
no, you did not get me!! it is an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
calm down, do you want this unit or not?
i do not want this unit!!
well, you should have told me that before, I am not a mind reader. hey, we are out of beer. I am going to monica’s.
fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)
hey! where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?
oh monica, listen, i ah, i saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. if you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
why, what is wrong with my bathroom floor?
nothing. it is just old and dingy, that is all.
i highly doubt that. (they both go to the bathroom)
oh yeah. if you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. (monica gasps) yeah.
i can not live like this! what are we going to do? what are we going to do?
relax. here hold this (hands her his beer). this old stuff just comes right off. (he bends down to try and lift some tile right in the middle of the floor, in his tight pants.)
that is a little more than i wanted to see.
(manages to pry off only a small piece) aw! look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. it would take forever to pry this up. you should ah, you should just leave it. (starts to walk away, but monica grabs him)
i can not leave it! you gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
eh! there you go.
you know that is nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
(sits up) oh, ew!
yeah i know what i wanted to ask you. um, can you roll your tongue? because i can, and my mom could not, and i thought y'know, i figured that was something i got from our dad.
yeah, yeah. you can do it to. (tries to do it, but can not)
oh right, yeah okay, my mom could, and i can not. we do not have that....
feburary 16th.
wow, that is close. when is yours?
that is the same month as halloween. so, um, what kind of things do you like to do at home?
okay, I have got three of my five.
three of your five, what?
celebrities I am allowed to sleep with.
oh my god! you are giving this a lot of thought.
yeah, it is hard okay, i only have two spots left.
all right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
okay, elizabeth hurely....
oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
susan sarandon.
eh, y'know what, she is to political, she probably would not let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
and!! isabella rosselini.
ooh-hoo. very hot, very sexy. but ah, y'know she is too international, y'know she is never going to be around.
so?
so, you got to play the odds, pick somebody who is going to be in the country like all the time.
yeah, ‘because that is why you will not get isabella rosselini, geography.
okay so, by melting, you meant melting.
so is it like art?
um, yeah sure. why you want to call your mom?
oh, well um, not right now. y'know I am just going to go to bed, i think the fumes are giving me a headache.
g’night, bro.
here. (gives him a fire extinguisher) y'know, just in case.
what kind of karate is that?
no kind. he just makes it up.
so how is it going with you guys?
so far, it kind of blows. i do not know, i just thought y'know that he would feel more like a brother y'know, like you and ross, just like close and connected and....
oh honey, we are close now but you-you would not believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and....(phoebe shakes her head like she does not understand) that is where the waistband actually goes over your head.
ah!!
oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
oh, how do you play the shadow game?
oh, how do you play the shadow game?
i just asked you.
i just asked you.
i do not have time for this.
no, that is what the game is.
which you just gave up really quickly.
(entering) have you seen joey?
what is the matter?
oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) y’know what it is my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
(yelling from bathroom) hey, does somebody want to hand me one of those tiles.
what is going on?
he is retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)
yo!! spackel boy! get up!
ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.
he started mine first!
build the unit cinderelly, lay the tile cinderelly.
yeah. (phone rings and phoebe answers it) ‘hello. (listens) oh my god, i totally forgot! (listens) well can not someone else do it. (listens) but, i have company. (listens) yeah, no look, that is all right I will come in.’ (hangs up phone) um, frank, I am really sorry but i have to go to work. it is-it is one of my regulars and he is insisting that i do ‘um.
oh! I am a masseuse. i give people massages and stuff.
well, y'know we do not call it that, but yeah!
all righty. I will be back in-in a little bit. unless you want to come with me?
no, no, you can get one yourself. it will be on the house! y'know what are big sisters for?
no, no, no, i would not do you myself, i mean that would be weird. yeah, no, I will get one of the other girls to do it. oh, this will be so much fun! hey! are you excited?
it is beautiful! it is like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (chandler tries to go to the bathroom) whoa! are you going in there for?
what, like a number?
(entering) hey!
hi! bye! (runs to the bathroom)
okay, I am done with my choices, these are final. (holds up a little card)
well, it is about time.
ooh, very official.
oh, yeah, well y'know chandler printed it up on his computer.
and who laminated it?
that would be me.
all right let me see. (grabs the card) uma thurman, winona ryder, elizabeth hurely, michelle pfieffer, and dorothy hammel?
hey, it is my list.
okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
hey!-hey! what is going on?
you can not have sex with her!
okay, jasmine, can you, can you ask mr. whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
(turns around and hits frank) so that is what you thought i did!! god! that is not what i do!
nooo! why would you think that?
whatever, it is the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
you really thought it was perfect?
yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
i do not....
right, okay, um-mm.
yeah, i guess i do, yeah.
well, i-i was not hopping mad, y'know.
okay. all right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
uh-huh.
she was not a hooker.
okay, on three. one....two....
why do not we just go on two.
why two?
because it is faster.
yeah, i coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.
oh!
all right, but in the future...
okay!! okay!!
come on!
heavy thing, not getting lighter!
okay, one...two...
so we are going on two?
oh, good job joe.
wow, it is big!
yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
maybe, my ruler’s wrong.
maybe all the rulers are wrong.
look it is not that bad. so what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
yeah, y'know what i got a better idea. how-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it does not move.)
yeah, listen, before i forget that side is still wet.
okay sir, um-mm, let see if i got this right. ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? (the guy nods) okay, great. (she starts to walk away and under her breath) you freak.
(to gunther) thank you.
isabella rosselini. (points to her)
are you serious? (they all look) oh my god.
damn! i can not believe i took her off my list.
why? ‘because otherwise you would go for it?
yeah, maybe.
oh-oh, you lie.
what you do not think I would go up to her?
ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
you know what honey, you go ahead, we will call her an alternate.
okay, hold my crawler.
okay.
rach, are you really going to let him do this?
honey, he is about to go hit on isabella rosselini. I am just sorry we do not got popcorn.
(to isabella) hi! hi, I am ross, you do not know me, but I am a big, big fan of yours. i mean, blue velvet, woo-oo hoo! um, i was wondering if i could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? (gunther hands her change) or maybe reimburse you for that one?
well, yeah, kind of. um, but that is okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, (gets his out) so I am allowed to sleep with you. no, no, no, it is flattery.
oh no, no, no, wait, wait, isabella. do not, do not just dismiss this so fast. i mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
um, yeah.
um, no.
but, okay.
um, see, but that is not the final draft.
yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, chandler (chandler waves) brought up the very good point that you are international, so i bumped you for wynona rider, local.
what?
(to the rest of the gang) we are just going to be friends.
y'know what?
umm?
i bet ‘ya ya i could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)
I have got five bucks says you can not.
get out your checkbook, mister.
oh, i think i have the cash.
you are dogged man! i totally fit!
yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors will not open) I am out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) here you go.
thank you. cha-ching! (chandler starts to leave) oh, well hello mr. lincoln. better luck next time buddy. (chandler leaves and closes the door) and the drinks are on me!
everybody? shh, shhh. uhhh... central perk is proud to present the music of miss phoebe buffay.
hi. um, i want to start with a song that is about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. ok, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) ok, thank you very much.
oh, great. this is just...
wow, this is so cool, you guys. the entire city is blacked out!
mom says it is all of manhattan, parts of brooklyn and queens, and they have no idea when it is coming back on.
wow, you guys, this is big.
(into phone) pants and a sweater? why, mom? who am i going to meet in a blackout? power company guys? eligible looters? could we talk about this later? ok. (hangs up)
can i borrow the phone? i want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to monica) what is my number?
well, i never call me.
oh my god, it is that victoria's secret model. something... something goodacre.
she is right, it is jill. jill goodacre. oh my god. i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! (pause) is it a vestibule? maybe it is an atrium. oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
jill says vestibule... I am going with vestibule.
oh! some guy. some guy. 'hey jill, i saw you with some guy last night. yes, he was some guy.
hi everyone.
and officiating at tonight's blackout, is rabbi tribbiani.
well, chandler's old roomate was jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... happy chanukah, everyone.
(at window) eww, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.
that had to hurt!
alright, alright, alright. it is been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. oh god, do something. just make contact, smile!
there you go!
you are definitely scaring here.
yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with. yeah, thanks. (takes phone)
hello?
hey, it is me.
(to everyone) it is chandler! (on phone) are you ok?
yeah, I am fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I am trppd in an atm vstbl wth jll gdcr.
what?
I am trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr!
i have no idea what you just said.
(angry) put joey on the phone.
what is up man?
I am trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr.
(to everyone) oh my god! he is trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! (on phone) chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
alright, somebody.
ok, I will go. ok, senior year of college... on a pool table.
that is my sister.
ok... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library.
oh my god! what were you doing in a library?
pheebs, what about you?
oh... milwaukee.
um... ross?
disneyland, 1989, 'it is a small world after all.'
the ride broke down. so, carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom.
oh, rachel.
oh come on, i already went.
you did not go!
oh, alright. the weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed.
step back.
we have a winner!
i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
well, it was the only thing to do there that did not have a line.
there, well, see? barry would not even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
come on.
no, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
(sarcastically) and you did not marry him because...?
i mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
probably. but you know, I will tell you something. passion is way overrated.
yeah right.
it is. eventually, it kind of... burns out. but hopefully, what you are left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. so, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there is all that other good stuff.
(sigh) ok.
but, um... i do not think that is going to be you.
you do not.
uh-uh. see, i see.... big passion in your future.
really?
mmmm.
you do?
i do.
oh ross, you are so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
it is never going to happen.
(innocently) what?
you and rachel.
(acts surprised) what? (pause) why not?
because you waited too long to make your move, and now you are in the friend zone.
no, no, no. I am not in the zone.
ross, you are mayor of the zone.
I am taking my time, alright? I am laying the groundwork. yeah. i mean, every day i get just a little bit closer to...
priesthood! look ross, I am telling you, she has no idea what you are thinking. if you do not ask her out soon you are going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
i will, i will. see, I am waiting for the right moment. (joey looks at him) what? what, now?
yeeeeaaaahhh! what is messing you up? the wine? the candles? the moonlight? you have just got to go up to her and say, 'rachel, i think that...' (rachel comes into the room behind them)
shhhh!
what are you shushing?
we are shushing... because... we are trying to hear something. listen. (everyone is silent) do not you hear that?
ahhhh!
see?
huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
um, is it sugarless?
oh, then no thanks. what the hell was that? mental note: if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it. if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
(singing) new york city has no power, and the milk is getting sour. but to me it is not scary, because i stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)
(to joey) ok, here goes.
are you going to do it?
I am going to do it.
do you want any help?
you come out there, you are a dead man.
good luck, man.
thanks. (joey hugs him) ok.
ok. (ross goes out on the balcony to talk to rachel)
hey, where are you going?
outside.
you can not go out there.
why not?
because of... the reason.
and that would be?
i, um, can not tell you.
joey, what is going on?
ok, you have got to promise that you will never, ever tell ross that i told you.
about what?
he is planning your birthday party.
oh my god! i love him!
(as phoebe enters) you would better act surprised.
about what?
my surprise party!
what surprise party?
oh stop it. joey already told me.
well, he did not tell me.
hey, do not look at me. this is ross's thing.
this is so typical. I am always the last one to know everything.
no, you are not. we tell you stuff.
yuh-huh! i was the last one to know when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. i was the last one to know when you had a crush on joey when he was moving in. (monica gestures at phoebe to shut up; joey looks surprised but pleased) looks like i was second to last.
hmmm... this is so nice.
ok, i have a question. well, actually, it is not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
ok.
ok. here goes. for a while now, I have been wanting to, um....
ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind ross)
yes, yes, that is right...
oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind ross)
what? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) ow!
(to ross) this is just bactine. it will not hurt.
sorry, that was wax.
oh, poor little tooty is scared to death. we should find his owner.
why do not we just put 'poor little tooty' out in the hall?
during a blackout? he would get trampled!
(nonchalantly) yeah?
you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'gum would be perfection'? 'gum would be perfection.' could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I will have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. for me, gum is perfection. i loathe myself.
(stops at a door) oh no, the mendels, they hate all living things, right?
oh. (they knock at the next door, mr. heckles answers) hi. we just found this cat and we are looking for the owner.
(trying to hold back the struggling cat) he seems to hate you. are you sure?
wait a minute. what is his name?
bob buttons?
(the cat runs away from her) oooh! you are a very bad man!
here, kitty-kitty. here kitty-kitty. where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
(rolling) lucky sixes....
(entering with paolo, arm in arm) everybody, this is paolo. paolo, i want you to meet my friends. this is monica.
(smitten) hi!
and joey....
hi!
and ross.
hi!
(proudly) he does not speak much english.
look at that!
(jealous) so, um... where did paolo come from?
oh... italy, i think.
no, i mean tonight, in the building. suddenly. into our lives.
well, the cat... the cat turned out to be paolo's cat!
that, that is funny... (to joey).... and rachel keeps touching him.
alright. i looked all over the building and i could not find the kitty anywhere.
oh, i found him. he was paolo's cat.
ah! well! there you go! last to know again! and I am guessing... since nobody told me... this is paolo.
ah, paolo, this is phoebe.
(smiling) you betcha!
(chewing gum) ah, let us see. what next? blow a bubble. a bubble's good. it is got a... boyish charm, it is impish. here we go.
nice going, imp. ok, it is ok. all i need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
good save! we are back on track, and I am... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. this is not my gum. oh my god! oh my god! and now you are choking.
(gasping) yes... thank you. that was... that was....
(mocking paolo) blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
wha-what did he say that was so funny?
i have absolutely no idea.
that is... that is classic.
(to monica and phoebe) oh my god, you guys, what am i doing? what am i doing? this is so un-me!
if you want, I will do it.
i know, i just want to bite his bottom lip. (rachel looks at her) but i will not.
god, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in bermuda with barry.
you know, did you ride mopeds? because I have heard... (they stare at her)... oh, i see... it is not about that right now. ok.
y'know, i know it is totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we do not even speak the same language but goooooooddddddd....
paolo. hi.
listen. um, listen. something you should... know... um, rachel and i... we are kind of a thing.
thing, yes. thing.
no, no, no. technically the... sex is not... being had, but that is... see, that is not the point. see, um, the point is that... rachel and i should be, er, together. you know, and if you get in the.... um...
no, no, that is not where i was going. er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then i would be, well, very sad.
yeah! se vice?
so you do know a little english.
do you know the word crapweasel?
that is funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
ok.
oh, look look look. the last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark)
thank you.
thanks.
kind of... spooky without any lights.
(does a maniacal laugh) bwah-hah-hah!
ok, guys, guys? i have the definitive one. mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
oh.. oh... oh.
hey ross. this probably is not the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for monica.
yes. yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
hi, um, I am account number 7143457. and, uh, i do not know if you got any of that, but i would really like a copy of the tape.
hey! new wallet, huh?
yeah, it was time. the old condom ring in the leather just does not say ‘cool’ anymore.
rachel!
what?
you just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
oh yeah, i know, but the garbage was full.
have you ever taken out the trash? (hands her the garbage.)
well, i thought you liked doing it. (rachel starts out the door and stops.)
third door on the left.
right!
oh! hey, mr. treeger.
ummm. oh! I am sorry. (she grabs the box and offers him a piece.) it is a little old but…
I am sorry. i did not—i do not come in here a lot.
no.
i did not… i never said that.
(starting to cry) okay, I am sorry. (runs out still carrying the pizza box.)
god! if you are going to cry about it! (she grabs the box and goes to through it out.]
whoa-whoa, treeger made you cry?
yes! and he said really mean things that were only partly true.
I am going to go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
joey, please do not do that. i think it is best that we just forget about it.
that is easy for you to say, you were not almost just killed.
all right that is it, school is in session! (exits and slams the door.)
(picking up a card from chandler’s wallet.) my god! is this a gym card?
oh yeah, gym member. i try to go four times a week, but I have missed the last 1200 times.
so why do not you quit?
you do not think I have tried? you think i like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? no, they make you go all the way down there! then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! then they bring out maria.
who is maria?
oh maria. you can not say no to her, she is like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
you need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
no!
so you are strong enough to face her on your own?
oh no, you will have to come.
hey! you hold on pal! now you made my friend, rachel, cry. so now, you are going to go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
have you heard about a little something called, not making girls cry.
i have actually not heard of that.
why do not you tell me something i do not know! (he storms out, and once treeger closes the door behind him, joey makes an ‘oops!’ have.)
oh please, somebody tell me i do not have to go to work today!
what is the matter?
oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time i see him i just want to do things to him that I am not allowed to charge for.
so do them for free.
oh no, it is forbidden! no-no, mrs. potter fires people for fooling around with clients. and it is against my oath as a masseuse.
they make you take an oath?
no, i made myself take an oath. yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. yeah, that one’s actually from the boy scouts, but it just makes good sense.
why do not you just give him to somebody else?
no, i can handle it. no, I am a professional. (she starts to leave)
oh pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
wow! and you got a petticure. your feet are all dressed up.
because that is the only part of you he can see when he is on the table!
you are going to do some feet flirtin’!
i do not what your talking about. (laughs nervously and continues to leaqve)
then how do you explain the toe ring?!
because it is arabian princess day at work! okay?! leave me alone!
oh! my hero! what happened?
well uh, i went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he would better come up here and apologize. I will see you later. (starts to leave)
what a minute, what did he say?
he said that he was not going to apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he is going to do is have you evicted—I will see you later.
what?! you got us evicted!!
i told you not to go down there!
well he made rachel cry!
rachel always cries!
that is not true! (starts to cry.)
now joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. i mean you suck like you have never sucked before!
all right! I will try! but if i can not, you can stay with chandler and i until you get settled.
go!!
all right, all right, all right. (starts to leave, stops, and turns around) i mean I will have to check with him first, but I will think he will be cool with it. (monica shoos him out.)
whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! now remember what we talked about, you got to be strong.
yes. (in a stronger voice) yes!
one more time, "hey, do not you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
no! i want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
good! that is good!
okay. (they go inside) (to the guy at the desk) i want to quit the gym.
i want to quit the gym.
(he turns to ross and ross makes a ‘be strong’ sound.) i want to quit the gym.
me? no.
(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) i want to quit the gym.
it is okay man, be strong. (chandler goes into the office.)
no! and I am not going to be, so you can save you little speech.
these old things.
you mean the—okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
sure, yeah, no i can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real (lifts up the towel) nice and tight. so umm, tell me rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
oh. (she goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)
no!
please do not kick monica and rachel out, this was not there fault, it was mine.
no you can not do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I am the chick and chandler is the duck.
come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I will do whatever you want.
yeah-yeah, absolutely.
what, what is it?
that is not, prison lingo, is it?
his dancing partner?!
yeah, there is this superintendent’s dance, the super ball. i do not know, and he wants to impress marge, this lady super that he is a crush on.
well, why does not he practice with a girl?
well, he is too shy, he does not thing he is good enough to dance with girls yet.
yeah, right, he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute. (starts to cry)
oh, would you let it go already?! you are fine!
hey.
hey! so, did you quit?
no, i almost did, could not leave ross there without a spotter!
wait, now so you joined the gym?
and that is funny, why?
oh, umm, i was just y’know working out and umm… oh, that is it.
we are doomed. okay, they are going to take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. what are we going to do?
well, you could actually go to the gym.
or! or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
you are a genius!
aww, man, now we will not be bank buddies!
now, there is two reasons.
(entering) hey.
ohh, you guys, remember that cute client i told you about? i bit him.
where?!
on the touchy.
and that is not against your oath?!
no, i know! i-I am sorry, but the moment i touch him, i just want to throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
yeah! yeah! yeah! like-like when I am doing something exciting and i do not want to get too excited, i just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah chandler!
thank you, joey.
no-no, thank you.
all right, I am here, let us ahh, get this over with.
whoa-whoa, do not we need to do some kind of preparation first? like ahh, get really drunk?
no, it is okay, but if I am marge, my breasts are coming out my back.
come on man, you are not a potato.
come on treeger, do not say that. you just ahh, you just need more practice. here, come on, let us ahh, let us try it again. come on. (they start dancing again) plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. i mean, y’know, I am not really that comfortable dancing with a—(treeger throws him) we-he!! hey!
hey-hey, how goes the dancing? gay yet?
ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (he walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)
(laughing) what was that?
what?
you just did a little dancy thing.
no i did not.
yes you did! you did like a little hop.
you are soo enjoying this.
no, I am not! and it was not a hop it was a pademarie.
(laughing harder) you know the words! you are so into this!
all right, well maybe I am enjoying it a little bit. i mean I am getting pretty good at it.
ooh, this is soo sweet, joey our little twinkle-toes.
hey-hey, hold on, this is not some kind of like girly dance. all right, it is like a sport, it is manly!
all right, then show me some manly moves.
all right.
i do not know how to lead.
hello.

no, we would just like to close them.

(thinking to herself) chandler’s knees. chandler’s… ankles. chandler’s ankle hair. (notices the clock) oh no. (to rick) okay, you are all set.
yeah! in… really long hour world.
ugh, okay, i have an enormous crush on you. but because you are a client, i can not ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.

what?
(laughs) okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)
oh yeah, oh and i know, but this is not what it looks like, ‘because rick is my ahh, husband.
yes, i will tell her.
so you did not leave the bank?
no! and somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
what are you ever going to use that for?!
to pay for the gym.
hey.
hey! so i had a great day, rick and i really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a who are.
what?!

oh my gosh!
it is so weird, i have never been fired from anything before!
sweety...
i just-i just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? i-i started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. then these policemen, thought i was a who are too. it is been a really bad day, who are wise.
yeah… bunny-rabbit.
(to mr. treeger) so you ah, ready for our last practice?
look, you want to use our place?

i did not know where to put it so i just left it here for now.
oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
oh, okay.

i kind of like it here.
do you really like it?

oh really? what was your first?
well i-i really do not remember the name of it.
well what did it do?
well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
a vending machine?
do not feel bad for me! i won like every time!
hey! oh, I am so glad you guys are here. I have been dying to tell someone what happened in the paleontology department today.
(to rachel) do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
professor neuman, the head of the department, so….
they made you head of the department!
no, i get to teach one of his advanced classes! (pause) why did not i get head of the department? (goes and gets some coffee.)
oh! hey rach, listen umm…

you sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I will tell ya…
ooh, i miss dating. gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I am not going to be able to do that for so long, and it is so much fun! i mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
hey, y’know what?
huh?
why do not i take you out?
what?! joey, you do not want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
yes i do! and we are going to go out, we are going to have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out…
(interrupting) okay! I will go with ya! I will go! I will go with ya.
I will be fun.

no. no! yes! ahh. oh, would you look at that monica? i just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
okay, I am next. (phoebe starts another game.) do not! do not start another game! i said I am next! phoebe!
oh, I am sorry. i did not hear you over all the winning.
chandler! phoebe’s hogging the game!
who cares? it is a stupid game.
you only think it is stupid because you suck at it.
i do not suck. it is sucks. you suck.
wait okay, if this game is going to because problems between the two of you, then maybe i should just keep it.
no! no-no! i love it! it is a great present! in fact, why do not you go home and wait for the thank you card?
why do you want to play this game so bad?
yeah! it is not like it spits out a clark bar after every game.
okay. phoebe that is it. come on, get out—out of the chair. get out! (she goes to move phoebe, but phoebe goes limp and monica can not move her.) oh come…phoebe!
joey? could you get that? (there is no answer and she goes and opens the door to joey.) what are you doing here? i thought you were in your room?
no, I am picking you up for our date. these are for you. (hands her some flowers.)
ohh, lilies. joey, they are my favorite. thank you.
and, a brownie! (hands her a bag with the brownie in it.) well, half a brownie. actually, it is just bag. it is been a long walk from the flower shop and i was startin’ to feel faint so…
oh man! this is so great! i actually feel like I am going on a real date! although, i have a hint of morning sickness, and I am wearing underwear that goes up to about…(she snaps the waistband on her underwear that is just slightly below her breasts)…there.
hey come on now, this is a real date. uh, so…nice place you got here. foosball, huh? pizza box. oh, a subscription to playboy, my kind of woman.
yeah, actually that is my roommate’s.
i would like to meet him. he sounds like a stand up guy.
ah yes, but he is very protective of me so you would better watch yourself.
ah… hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?
hm-mmm.
oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
(laughs) yeah, but I am pretty sure he is gay.
no-no-no-no, he is not! no! why are you trying to ruin the game? come on!
…which brings us back, of course, to greely’s theory of dominance. (the bell rings.) okay, that-that is all for today. oh, uh does anyone know where the freeman building is?
what?! that-that is all the way cross town, I am supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
move it! move it! move it!! hey!!! I am the teacher!!
hello. (he throws his jacket towards the coat rack and misses.) I am sorry I am a little late. ah—(checks his watch)—whoa! a lot late. let me start by uh, by introducing myself, i am professor geller. (the bell rings.) so to sum up, I am professor geller. good job today.
now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
emmm. now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway i can substitute the three-pound lobster?
y’know what? bring her both, and I will have the same. (the waitress leaves.)
wow! this is shaping up to be a pretty good date—oh, i almost forgot. i did not pay you the rent check.
oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. okay? we are on a date.
okay. wow! so i get to see what joey tribbiani is like on a date. so do you have any moves?
no! no. umm, just myself and if they do not like me for—(laughs.) I am sorry i could not even get through that.
i knew it! i knew it. come on tell me your moves.
oh alright. umm, well, okay, i usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
oh my god. and that works?!
well it does when you combine it with, "this is so embarrassing, i just want to have a normal life!"
oh, you poor little famous man.
oh okay, how about this one. i was going to wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you are so beautiful…i do not think i can.
(looks interested) oh my god! wow! that was fantastic, i almost leaned in. i really almost did!
alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.
alright. so where did you grow up?
that is your move? boy rach, you are lucky you are hot.
come on, just answer the question!
(exasperated) queens.
and so were-were you close to your parents?
yeah, with my mom. yeah, not so much with my dad.
why not?
i do not know. i guess there is just always been this distance y’know—i mean we both try to pretend it is not there, but it is.
(sympathetic) oh. (starts rubbing his wrist with her fingers.) it is got to be rough.
yeah, it is. it is really tough. y’know sometimes i think—wow!! nice move!
huh?
"where did you grow up," it is so simple!
thank you! and now if you will excuse me, i have to go to the rest room.
yeah.
and now you are watching me walk away.
yes i am! again so simple!
hey.
you are not going to believe what i did today!
well it clearly was not showering or shaving.
i got good. i played this game all day and now i rule at it! they should change the name of it to ms. chandler. (pause) although i-i hope they do not.
wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played ms. pac-man while i went off to work like some kind of chump?!
uh-huh, and i got all the top ten scores, i erased phoebe off the board! high five! (holds up his hand to give monica a high five, only he can not straighten his fingers.)
what is the matter with your hand?
well I have been playing it for like eight hours, it will loosen up. come on, check out the scores. oh, and also look at the initials, they are dirty words.
chandler, why would you do that?
because it is awesome.
you think this is clever?
well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after a-s-s it is a bit of a challenge.
hey wait a minute, this one is not dirty.
it is when you put it together with that one.
ah, well if you do not clear this off, you will not be getting one of those from me. but ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can not be there.
come on, he will not even know what they mean.
chandler! he is seven; he is not stupid.
have you talked to him lately?
all right, look I am just going to unplug it.
no-no-no, if you unplug it, I will have nothing to show for my day! it would be like i was at work. (she unplugs it.) no! (and plugs it back in.) hey look at that! look at that, it is still there! this thing must have some kind of primitive rom (read only memory, it is a memory chip.) chip in it or something!
honey you-you got to beat your scores!
with the claw?!
all right fine. fine, I will do it. I have just got to get this off the screen. carol and susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
(smiles) pull my finger—(looks at his hand)—my hand is messed up.
i am not going to answer that!
oh come on! just pick one! between monica, phoebe, chandler, and ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
no one! they are my friends, i would not punch any of them.
chandler?
yeah, but i do not know why. look at me, I am having such a wonderful time!
me too! hey rach, can i just say i think this is the best date i ever had!
i know!
i never laughed so hard—did you see the wine come out of my nose?
joey, i think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
i got to say, i never knew i could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
huh. huh.
all right, now do not judge me. i normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I am ripping into this swan.
ah! okay, well then you do not judge me. I am going to suck on the cellophane from the brownie i had before. (they both do as they planned.)
so tell me, what are joey tribbiani’s end of the night moves?
ah, well, if i want the girl to kiss me, first thing i do is make my lips look irresistible.
how do you do that?
now you can not tell anyone, but uh…i put on shiny lip balm.
oh my god!
yeah, like a moth to a flame, I am telling ya. okay all right, so now you go.
no, i do not want to tell you.
why not?
because it is embarrassing.
more embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (rachel just looks at him.) i did not say raspberry before did i? all right just-just tell me rach, just tell me!
(laughs) okay. all right, stand up. (they do so.) well, when we are at the door, i lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then i make this sound, "hmmm." okay, i know it does not sound like anything, but i swear it works.
(stunned and turned on) yeah. why—yeah, that would work for ya…
all right, i got to go to bed. honey, i had such a wonderful time.
oh. (she kisses him.) yeah. (she goes into her room.) me to. (he then starts to freak out.)
…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
no, i ran. it was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "get the hell out of my way!"
well, why did not you just take a cab?
ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it will take me twice as long. besides, i teach the class three times a week, who am i? rockefeller?
well you are not going to be able to keep doing this.
well i have to. okay? if i do not, they will take the class away from me. and…i already put it in my family newsletter.
you what?
you have seen it, the geller yeller.
right. wow!
besides, i-i think i figured out a much faster route, I am sure i can make it this time. i just…i just can not be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. (he goes to the bathroom as joey enters.)
hey!
hi! hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie cujo?
oh yeah, i still can not believe you have not seen cujo. what is wrong with you?
relax! it is not like it is citizen kane!
have you ever tried to sit through citizen kane?
yeah i know it is really boring, but it is like a big deal. anyway, i was thinking about renting cujo sometime.
oh yeah? all right, let us do it tonight.
well do not you have that big date tonight?
oh right!
hey joey, can i ask you something?
yeah.
after our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
oh my god! you did too? it totally freaked me out, what was that?!
i do not know! (pause) I am-I am kind of thinking it-it was the lobster…
oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
yeah, i mean i was up sick all night.
yeah me too, all night.
really?! how come we did not cross paths?
yeah well that is because uh…i stayed in my room. yeah, you do not want to look in my hamper.
okay, i got that. I will escape over there. I will come back over here. all right, come on ms. pac-man. it is got—right—(she dies.) well, you are just a little bitch, are not you?
(entering) hey, you guys. listen, I am sorry that i was hogging the game before—(sees the top ten list)—oh my god! your friends have some unfortunate initials!
they are all chandler.
chandler sucks! he could not have gotten this good!
i did. (looks at his still deformed hand) but it came at a price.
but ben is coming over tonight and he can not see this.
oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (they both look at him.) was it just me?!
yeah!!!! yes, i made it! I am on time! (grabs a bottle of water from a student, takes a drink, and splashes some on his face like the marathon runners do.) okay, why do not we all uh, (exhales loudly) open our books to page 23. where… (exhales again) where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. okay, (closes his book.) umm, why do not, why do not you all start to read, while i—(passes out and collapses.)
no-no! I am fine. it is just… hey, can i ask you something? have you ever looked at someone that you have known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?
yeah. yeah, that…that is exactly it. you are right. yeah.
(deadpan) ooh! yeah. so yeah, so you know exactly what I am talking about.
oh yeah, sure. (she gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and joey watches her go.) ehhh.
oh my god phoebe, you are on fire!
i know!
one more score to go! you can do it! (touches her shoulder.)
do not touch me!!
do not touch her!!
all right! go left! go left! go right!! go right!!
i can not!! i can not!! (she dies.) noooooooo!!!!!!! you son of a bitch!!!!!
phoebe!!
oh hi ben—no!! do not look at the machine! (covers the screen.)
oh god! thank god you are home! I am watching cujo.
(incredulous) alone?!
yes! but what is wrong with this dog?!
hey, did you get to the part where they are trapped in the car and cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?
no! no! seriously, what is wrong with the dog?! wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? what happened to your date?
oh uh, it did not work out.
oh. do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
oh uh, okay. yeah.
y’know, i never thought I would say this about a movie, but i really hope this dog dies. (joey brings over a stool at sits on it next to rachel who is in the big chair.) what are you doing over there? come sit here, you protect me.
oh sure, yeah, why not? (sits on the arm of the chair.)
okay. (pushes play.) okay, that is him! that is him! that is cujo! that is cujo!
all right, i know! i know. yeah, it will be okay.
oh my god….what is he going to do now? i can not watch! (drags joey closer to her and cowers into his chest.) oh. seriously, how can you watch this? are not you scared?
terrified. (but for a totally different reason.)
so is everybody here? i got here a little early myself. let us begin. now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. (he moves to the map and we see why he made it to class on time, he is wearing in-line skates and has not taken them off.) here. (points to the map, somewhere in the middle east, then spins on the skates and points to the map.) here. (china.) now as for the hydrosaurs…
did you see our bank statement? can this be right?
i know...god. i have not seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed oreos. what happened to all our money?
I am not sure what they did, but I am inclined to blame enron.
i guess with you doing the internship, we are just spending more than we are bringing in.
maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.
oh, but you are finally doing something that you love! i can not ask you to give that up. though it would be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
you know what? you know what? i think we are making too big a deal out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change. you are chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
no! we are not borrowing money.
why not?
because we do not do that. we are bings! and if there is one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
wow! i had no idea you had this much pride.
that is right! i do! and I am your man. and I am going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
why??
oh...you do not have to go, i have something that will fit you.
i want you to stay.
why do not you turn them inside ou...
I will miss you.
great! ok...I will go get the tube top.
wow, mike hannigan...you sure know how to make a girl say "hell yeah!"
yeah! let us do it! let us live together! (they embrace and mike kisses phoebe) oh god, we are really going to move in together!
I have always wanted to live with a guy. "pick up your socks!" "put down the toilet seat!" "no! we are not having sex anymore!" it is going to be fun!
hey joey!
hey!
listen...i need to know that what I am about to ask you, will never get back to chandler.
I would be lying if i said i have not thought about it myself. chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. good...(he winks)...but wrong.
(looks exasperated) ok first of all...it would be great. but that is not what I am here to talk to you about. i need to borrow some money.
aww, i do not know monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
but chandler lent you money!
and i think he would tell you it was a mistake.
come on...i just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
oh...how much?
two thousand dollars?
two thousand dollars!? what do you think i am? i soap opera star!?
yeah...
that is right i am! (opens drawer and rummages through it. rachel enters)
hi you guys!
oo...what is in the bag?
oh er... well you know emma started crawling? i realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. so i went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
oh...baby-proofing... why is this such a big deal now? y'know, when i was a kid it was like.. "whoops! joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "whoops! joey electrocuted himself again!" huh!
anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
no. i was just going to do this myself. (joey makes a sarcastic laugh.)
you are going to do it?
yeah, why? you do not think a woman can do this?
oh, women can. you can not.
monica...would you please tell joey that he is a pig?
you are a pig. and you can not do this.
wha!? what!? come on! i found the hardware store all by myself!
the hardware store is right down the street.
there is a hardware store right down the street?
hey you guys! ok, we have got great news.
i know it is so exciting! you know I have never lived with a guy before.
well you know it is just like living with a girl. only they do not steal your makeup. unless they are playing "this is what my sister would look like" (looks at chandler)
yeah.... she is not so cute.
okay, well you put down the toilet seat.
is that a bit you guys do?
uh huh...we are playing you two.
we do not do that! tell her we do not do that!
yes dear.
i can not believe you guys are moving in together. that is, that is great! i mean...I am happy for you guys..
i hear wedding bells.
monica slow down! ok? I am just excited to be living with him. you know i mean, i do not know, can i see someday being married to mike? sure! yeah. y'know..i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. but do i want that house in connecticut...you know..near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior.. oh my god i do.
phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional.
i know! i guess i am! oh my god! load up the volvo i want to be a soccer mom!
yeah! you bet roomy!
do not you mean..groomy?
oh please, these guys, we have not even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. (mike seems to gag a little...and laughs nervously. they begin to leave. phoebe bolts back)
china patterns!!!!!
this is easy...can not do this! (moves away...and finds her sweater sleeve stuck to the drawer) oh! wow! seriously i can not do this. (fiddles more)
hey joe!
hey!
listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can not tell monica anything about it.
i thought you did not have secrets from monica.
and that would have made the official party line. (joey nods) monica and i are having a little financial trouble.
yeah, i know.
what? what do you mean you know?
err... i just figured it out! you know, i mean you are not working and the economy is bad.
oh! right.
(to himself) that is the fastest i have ever thought!
anyway, err... i need to borrow some money.
oh! sure! how much? two thousand dollars?
yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that! (joey begins writing a cheque)
err...well i...know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is. (shrugs)
oh ok.
(to himself) i am on fire!
err... kind of.
i can not believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?
oh no no no no no... it was not... it was not because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
what?
something personal.
what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she would not tell me about?
boob job.
i do not want her to get a boob job! that is crazy!
well it is...it is not that crazy okay? making them smaller, that would be crazy.
oh! alright. well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it is a play on the word roomy.
oh no! no no! not at all. we are just moving in right now. see where it goes.
what do you mean?
oh. wow.
was it really that bad?
ok, well that is bad. but do not you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. except for once in the ocean.
but it is just...
oh!
no! i definitely do not want to get married. no i just wanted to make sure you did not want to too. whew! coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there is going to be hell to pay mister!
yeah i get that.
hi!
so you gave in and decided to call someone?
yeah, i do not know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.
oh thank you so much. (picks up the guy's spirit level) oh oh wait! you forgot your erm...your game. (hands it to him)
hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.
do not look at me i never get his jokes.
thank you?
oh no..do not thank me. thank you. you know there is not one thing i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not... two... single things.
ok, you are being wierd. do you want sex or did you do something bad?
no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for your form.
ok..you know the old classics you know,you look nice? they are still ok.
well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice. i want to compliment your body. i mean..i would not change it. at all. and more specifically, i would not want anything to get any bigger.
okay...
i mean, you would not want any part of me to get any bigger would you? do not answer that.
just when you thought that dude could not get any wierder.
i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
i do not know! i mean, what brought that on?
oh my god. we are trying to get pregnant so he is probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
no you really think that is what it is?
you heard him! "no bigger!" "you are perfect!" "just do not get any bigger!" oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. you know what? I am going to have to talk to chandler.
yeah! if you do not i will! of course your body's going to change. your breasts are going to get bigger, your ass is going to get bigger, you are going to lose bladder control. (she starts sobbing) god! it is just such a magical time!
hi
hey!
listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage.
oh great now you are seeking me out to make jokes? i mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
no...i really wanted to know how you feel about it.
why?
mike does not ever want to get married.
never?
never.
wow, are you still going to move in with him?
i want to, but i just want you to tell me that marriage is not really that big a deal. you know that i will not, i will not be missing out on anything. that marriage stinks!
yeah, marriage... stinks! i mean if you want to see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? get them married.
that is not how you really feel is it?
no, I am sorry. look i do not think that is what you want to hear right now but i can not help it. i love marriage.
seriously? you divorce-of?
if you have to call me name, i prefer "ross the divorcer". it is just cooler. look, i know my marriage is not exactly work out. but i love to be that committed to another person. and carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I am sorry.
it is ok that is how you feel.
but come on! i mean living together will be great! i mean you guys have so much fun and you love mike.
i do love mike.
yeah see? and you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? you should be. it is a big deal!
yeah i guess you are right. yeah thanks. this helped. thanks.
the divorcer, to the rescue!
it is not cooler.
yeah i just hurt it.
rach?! (he walks over to the fridge to put it in, but it cannot be opened either) rachel!!!!? (he walks to the bathroom and tries to lift the toilet seat cover. it will not come up.) so i can not do anything i like????
hey rach! ah........ perfection. (kisses monica) would not change a thing. not a thing.
honey?
yeah?
about that? erm...I am going to change.
but honey you do not have to.
I am going to get bigger!
honey i... i love your breasts the way they are!
argh. fascist
well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! and you know what? it is not just my breasts. my ass is going to get bigger too.
your ass?!?!?
man, do not be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
they...do that?
it is kind of a package deal!
god why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
i thought i was something that we both wanted!
alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. but the giant ass and the big clown feet?
oh my god chandler! if you can not handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? with the blood and the screaming and the little present that is shooting out of her!?
(sedated) what?
joey! why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?
because she is!
joey, chandler knows i borrowed the money.
mmmm hmm! for your boob job!
ok so I am out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
hey! what do you guys think about this. "ross: the divorce-force".
better.
hey pheebs, you know I am I am really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful.
oh yeah you were helpful! yeah, no, thanks you.
good, good. yeah coz the more i thought about it, the more i realised i do not think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
what do you mean?
well, i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo?
they are awfully boxy...
i do not know you would be so bored with marriage. i mean it is so... normal.
uh huh.
hey hey, can i help?
well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
you know sometimes your words... they hurt.
hey uh, where do you guys want this?
yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. (she suddenly let us go) i mean not for me because I am only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there is no wiggle room? none at all?
right. except that i do want to get married.
(voice strained) could not have this conversation down at the truck huh?
someday.
aaaaand....... hernia.
i have not exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it is my turn some of the regular stuff.
because i just did not know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and i wanted to live with you.
but i do not think i can! it was ok to move in when i did not know what was going to happen, but i can not move in knowing that nothing is ever going to happen.
are you going to change yours?
me neither. i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.
i do not want it to end either.
yeah.
I am so sorry pheebs.
we are all sorry... (they have a group hug)
ah, look on the bright side, i mean you will not have to live with this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you. (they hug again)
ah hah! i did it! ha ha! alright... (he takes a box out, about to close fridge, then thinks.) better take all i can carry. who knows when I will be able to get in here again!
okay! (stands up) this is it! (claps his hands) we are going to get married!
are you sure you want to do this?
well, hello, mrs. ross! (throws some rice.)
well, hello, mr. rachel! (throws some more rice.)
wait! (gets her bearings) okay!
whoa!
oh my god!
(entering with phoebe) come on pheebs! hurry! hurry! hurry! hurry!
okay! okay! okay! (they run into the chapel.)
oh my god!! is everybody getting married?!!
(to her) hey! do not you give me any of your—hey! (sees chandler and monica standing there.)
hey!
hey!
what are you guys doing here?
ross and rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! is not that why you guys are here?
yes! well that-yes.
why else would we be here?
well! what happened?! did we miss it?
we actually missed it.
well, maybe you would not have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!
this is insane!
what is the big deal, y’know? it is not like it is a real marriage.
what?!
yeah, if you get married in vegas, you are only married in vegas.
what are you talking about? if you get married in vegas you are married everywhere.
(shocked) really?!
yeah!
oh my god!—eh! well…
ohhh! (looks in the mirror and sees that she still has her mustache and groans.)
why are we in bed together?
i do not know. do-do you have any clothes on?
(checks) yeah.
really?!
no! but we-we did not have…sex-uh, did we? i mean, i do not remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
oh! i remember laughing! i laughed a lot.
and we did not have sex.
ohh, i mean, we were really drunk. I am just glad we did not do anything stupid.
(getting up) tell me about it. (he sits up on the edge of the bed and has "just married" written on his back.)
mornin’ pheebs. (sits down.) well, my movie has officially been canceled.
oh joey, I am so sorry. you want some of my breakfast?
nah, I am too depressed to eat. I will probably eat in like 5 minutes. so i guess I will just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?
what about my cab?
i do not need that anymore.
no, joey! you borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
i do not want to drive all the way back by myself, i get so lonely. (gets an idea.) oh—ooh! how about you come with me?
i do not know, it is such a long trip.
it will be great! we-we could talk, and play games! huh? this could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
sure?
all right. although i do not think we need one, i never stopped loving you.
hi!
hey.
hey.
so, has anyone talked to dr. and mrs. geller yet?
um-hmm, yeah. they left me a message; they should be here any minute.
where is the waitress?! I am starving!
it is a buffet man.
oh, here is where i win all my money back! (gets up and heads for the buffet table with chandler in tow.)
listen, i got to talk to you.
sure! what is up? (he grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. chandler just stares at him and joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)
monica and i almost got married last night.
oh my god! that is huge! (hugs him.) wait a minute, why come i was not invited? and who was going to be your best man? do not say, "ross." do not say, "ross."
look, i just do not think monica and i are ready to get married yet! y’know? i mean, i love her and everything but seeing ross and rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that monica and i are moving so fast. y’know? and, how do i tell her without crushing her?
oh! tell her she is not marriage material.
what?!
girls say it to me all the time! and believe me, if she is anything like me, she is just going to be relieved.
how do i tell chandler that it is too soon. it is going to break his heart, he is not going to think that i do not love him anymore.
well you do not.
yes i do!
good! good! i was just testing you.
(returning with joey) hi.
oh hi! hi! y’know, we were just talking about bacon.
no, we were talking about tennis. tennis is more believable.
hey!
hey!
what?
are we going to talk about what you guys did last night? or…
(to ross) i do not know. (to the gang.) what do you mean last night? nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
yeah!
uh-huh! ross invited us all to watch.
rach! we were not going to miss our friends getting married!
(gasps) who got married?! (ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)
(not quite sure) you did.
what?! hello! we did not get married.
no, we did not get married! that is ridiculous!
we-we-we—i remember being in a chapel.
oh my god.
i—they would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
no!
they let you get married when you are drunk! most people who get married in vegas are drunk!
hell, I am drunk right now! (they all turn and look at her.) what? i can not have a mimosa with breakfast?! I am on vacation!
what are you guys going to do?
well, i guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (looks at ross.)
well, i think, i think, ross already has one. now, this one’s free, right? because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.
laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. because we do not need to get divorced, okay? we we are just going to get an annulment.
an annulment? ross! i do not think surgery’s the answer here.
oh-oh, that is your thing.
what?
you are thing. you are thing. y’know? you are the guy who gets divorced.
no-no, that is-that is not my thing! i do not love getting divorced!
yes you do! this is your third divorce! you love divorce so much you are probably going to marry it! then it will not work out and you are going to have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (pause) I am so drunk.
so, what do you think we should do?
i do not know. but i-i-i know i love you!
i know i love you! (they hug.)
so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? i love you.
that is a good question. look umm, last night we let the dice decide. maybe we should leave it up to fate again. i love you!
yes, we do not get married unless there is a sign! okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there is a definite sign that we should get married.
all right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we do not get married.
sounds great.
okay. (they approach the craps table.)
ready?
ready!
(sarcastic) come on eight.
(deadpan) yes, yes eight.
wow! i can not believe i actually rolled an eight.
that was so unlikely. well, let us get married! i guess.
wait a minute. that was not a hard eight! last night i rolled a hard eight.
that is right! it was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! damnit!
i wanted it so bad! (pause) want to go pack?
yeah. (they go pack.) we are doing the right thing, right?
ohh, of course we are! (they walk up to the elevators.) we left it up to fate. (pushes the elevator button.) if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (the elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with chandler and monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)
okay, you have 19 questions left. use them wisely. (joey groans.) come on joey! you can not win if you do not ask any (sees that he is asleep) questions!!!
(wakes up) what?!
well, you promised me a fun road trip! we have been on the road six hours and you have been asleep for five and a half! we are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! that will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
all right. all right.
yeah! and until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
really? i do not…
sing!!
(starts singing) i want to rock and roll all night! (falls asleep.)
(to himself) man, this is a long drive! are my eyes open? no! (he opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)
hey!
hey, hubby!
yeah. yeah, actually um, i wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
uh-huh.
I am not going to do that. (rachel glares at him.)
okay! so, we will just stay married.
yes, exactly!
and i will make everyone call me mrs. geller!
wow! this is so amazing. i uh, i really thought I would have to talk you into this more.
okay, see now I am scared because i do not actually think you are kidding.
I am-I am not kidding. look i-i, i can not have three failed marriages. i can not. okay? i-i am not going to be that guy!
what-wh-what so we will just stay married forever?!
okay, look, how is this going to affect you? really? i mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says ms you check the box that says mrs.! it is right next to it!
ohh, okay, I am sorry. you are right. y’know what? we absolutely can stay married, because i was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. all right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you are asking of me.
I am asking you to do me a favor.
you are asking me to be your wife!
and as my wife i think you should grant me this favor.
that kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
well you did pull his hair.
he took my snack!
I am not getting into this again!
okay! oh god, y’know what? it is really bad.
 well, i told you not to walk. here. (picks her up.) there. okay. (he opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and let us go of monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
this does not mean anything, does it?
no!
okay.
(to joey) how could you pick up a hitchhiker?! he could be a rape—(she holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a killer or something!
do not you think i asked him that before he got in?!
y’know what? I am not talking to you! you go back to sleep! (to the hitchhiker) and you, are you a rapist?!
do you like car games?
i love the license plate game!
ooh, I will play! I will play!
no-no! you need your sleep. night-night! shh! (she closes the partition.)
hey!
hey!
listen, i know you wanted to talk to me, but i have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (rachel shakes her head.) we register, and you get to keep all the presents!
(thinks about it for a second) no! ross, come on! no! listen, look i thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, ross, is we can not stay married.
i do not know if it is true.
oh b-b-but it is!
oh, okay, y’know what this is? this is a difference of opinion. and when that happens in a marriage...
oh ross, come on! this is not, this is not a marriage!! this is the world’s worst hangover! ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, i will!
all right. all right, I will do it.
thank you. (he goes to leave.) hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
oh, okay.
and i have your name and the fact that you are a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
come on pheebs! i can not take this anymore! let-let me make it up to you. huh? (starts singing.) ground control to major tom. commencing countdown, engines on. take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
stop it! stop it no! that is not fair! y’know i can not resist that beautiful voice!
pheebs, i am so sorry! i know i promised you a fun road trip with your friend and i did not deliver. but-but-but now i know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! so, so, so i will strive to-to stay awake for as long as i know you.
you can still sleep at night and stuff.
well, thank you. so, can we play 20 questions now? I have got a really good one! I have been thinking about it since kansas.
okay. is it a kind of hot sandwich?
yes.
is it a meatball sub?
that is incredible! you are the master!
huh, that is funny. you look like you are going to be the…
no, do not say it! do not even think it!
all right. okay chandler, enjoy your handful. (exits.)
all right, should we just, should we just get married? y’know? i mean should we just do it? all the signs are telling us to do it.
I am sick of the signs! it is too fast, I am happy the way things are!
me too!
i do not want things to change! do you?
no!
all right then, then nothing changes! everything is great! everything stays the same! and you go unpack because it is been three days and it is driving me insane!
jeez, relax! it is not like we are mar-ah-ah!! (runs out.)
(entering, slowly) y’know i was thinking, what if i uh, unpack here?
then all your stuff would be here.
well, what if all my stuff was here?
then you would be going back and forth all the time, i mean it does not make any sense.
okay. what if we lived together and you understand what I am saying?
live together? there have been no signs for that.
me asking is kind of a sign.

oh thanks.

the door has not been locked in five years, but okay! (runs out.) ready?!
ready!
okay, a little problem. the key broke in the lock and i can not get in!

this is not a sign!
no, it is not a sign! it is a very old key!
it is an old key!
oh my god it is old!
i love you!
i love you!

no.
yeah-yeah, me neither.
hey!
hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
oh, yeah, no problems. it is all taken care of.
ross, thank you. hey, do you guys want to go see a movie?
oh yeah, why not?
pheebs?
no thanks, I have already seen one.
okay, umm, I am going to get my sweater. (walks away.)
okay. (sits down next to phoebe.) you uh, you want to hear something weird?
always.
i did not get the annulment.
what?!
we are still married! do not tell rachel. see you later. (he gets up leaving phoebe in shock.)
what are you doing?
the key’s stuck in the lock.
i can fix it. hold on. (he goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) look out. look out. (pries at the door a little bit.)
(trying the handle) it still does not work.
I am not finished.
oh.
nice job joe! you are quite the craftsmen.
hey you guys i got some bad news. (he sets the stack of papers down on the table.)
well that is no way to sell newspapers. why do not you try, "extra! extra! read all about it!"
no, monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the post. (they all gasp.) i did not want her to see it, so i ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies i could find. (he hands the paper to phoebe and they all read it.)
man, this is bad! and I have had my share of bad reviews. i still remember my first good one though. (quoting) "everything else in this production of our town was simply terrible. joey tribbiani was abysmal."
(entering) hey!
hey.
(seeing the stack of newspapers) oh my god! look at all the newspapers! it must be a good review! is it great?!
umm…
(reading) oh dear god!
but the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
what about the rest of manhattan?!
yeah, they all know.
oh my god, this is horrible!
I am so sorry.
I am so humiliated!
yeah but y’know what they say mon, "there is no such thing as bad press."
you do not think that umm, (reading) "the chef’s mahi mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
i did not write it.
is he right? am i really—am i awful?
yeah! yeah monica! you listen to me, okay? and I am not just saying this because I am your friend, I am sayin’ it ‘because it is the truth. you are food is abysmal!
ross!
(startling him) what?! what?
i am freaking out!
are ya?
my due date is in one week!
what are you doing up?
that is seven days!
okay look, i had a lot of water before i went to bed. can we do this after…
(interrupting him) no-no-no-no-no ross! please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! we do not a changing table! we do not have a crib! we do not have a diaper service!
it is funny you should mention diapers.
I am serious.
okay look, there is nothing to worry about. we have plenty of time. there is a great baby furniture store on west 10th. tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. okay?
okay. thank you. that is great. thank you. wait-wait! where on west 10th? because there is this really cute shoe store that has like this little…
(interrupting her) okay. okay. if uh, if you are going to do this, then I am going to do that. (points to the bathroom.) so… (starts for the bathroom.)
(stopping him) oh, wait ross! I am sorry, one more thing!
(annoyed) yeah!
umm, our situation. y’know umm, what we mean to each other. and i mean we-we are having this baby together, and we live together. is not that, is not that weird?
(stunned) (thinks) well uh…
I am just kidding! you can go pee! (he does so in a hurry.)
(entering) hey uh monica, i can not remember. did we say we were going to meet here or at the movies?
we said at the movies, but…
okay, I will see you there. (starts to leave)
joey! (he returns) now that you are here…
sure, i can hang out ‘til i have to meet ya. (to chandler) what uh—how come you are not going?
i have a job interview i have to get ready for.
i thought you already have a job.
and people say you do not pay attention. no, this is a much better job. it is vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
wow! how do you know how to do that?!
that is what i do now.
hey joey, come taste this.
what is it?
remember that guy that gave me a bad review? well… (feeds him a spoonful of what she is cooking.) I am getting my revenge!
you cooked him?
no. he teaches a course on food criticism at the new school, so before we go to the movies i want to go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. oh, i cannot wait to read the front page of the post tomorrow! "restaurant reviewer admits: i was wrong about monica."
the front page? you really do live in your own little world, do not ya?
oh.
oh.
no-no-no! no, no, no, we are not married.
we are having a baby together, but we are not involved. (the cashier, a very beautiful woman, looks confused) i mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. and then there was one drunken night. (rachel looks at him angrily) or, yes stranger, we would like this delivered please.
oh, okay.
oh yeah! actually, that is one of the reasons why we are not a couple.
i chose those, I am a paleontologist.
oh. oh yeah, do not get to worked up over it. i mean it-it sounds like he is a doctor, but he is not.
yeah! i-i teach it in my class.
oh my god! I am standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I am bored.
that is my gym.
i am like indiana jones.
hi pheebs!
hey! oh, how did baby shopping go?
oh, it was great! we got everything that we needed! oh and ross, almost got something that was not on the list. a who are.
what?!
well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
well did she know you two were not married?
yeah.
oh my god! well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
you do not understand! you did not see how brazen she was.
sounds like you are a little jealous.
no! I am not! i-i-i just think it is wrong! it is-it is that I am—here i am about to pop and he is out picking up some shop girl at sluts ‘r’ us!
is that a real place? (rachel’s stunned) are they hiring?
(entering) hey phoebe! (to rachel) fatty!
hey chandler, why so fancy?
well, i got a job interview. it is kind of a big deal too. its a lot more money and I would be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
wait, i think i know someone who does that.
me! i do that. so… seriously, do i look okay? I am little nervous.
oh yeah! you really—you look great.
yeah, just do not get your hopes up.
why not?
well, the interview…
what about it?
y’know! you do not make a very good first impression.
(shocked) what?!
oh you do not know.
are you serious?!
yes, when i first met you, you were like, "blah, blah, blah." i was like, shhh!
what is it that i do?
well it is just like you are trying too hard. always making jokes, y’know, you just—you come off a little needy.
(to rachel) did you like me when we first met?
chandler, I am not going to lie to ya, but i am going to run away from you. (gets up and hurries out.)
hi! umm, I am monica geller, I am the chef at alessandro’s.
i think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and i would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
either eat it, or be in it.
spoon? (hands him one and he tastes it.) so, what do you think?
thata girl! huh? we should get out of here; there is a new class comin’ in.
i can.
well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
monica.
okay. (does so.)
all this stuff takes up a lot of room. hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping ben in your life?
my son? pretty serious. (there is a knock on the door and ross answers it.) oh hey katie! (the cashier from before) what uh, what are you doing here?
ah, must have been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
oh. (reaches into his pocket for some money as rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)
oh! wow! uh, yeah! that sounds great. I am just going to put this (the money) back in my pocket, pretend that did not happen. uh yeah, actually I am free now. do you want to grab some coffee or…
horny bitch. (they both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs she is holding are arguing.) no! you are a horny bitch! noooo! you are the horny bitch! no! you are a horny bitch!
so you guys go, have a really good time.
(to katie) yeah, I am just going to grab my coat. and uh, and my whip. (katie looks worried.) y’know because of the indiana jones? (katie laughs) not-not because I am-I am into s&m. (katie’s worried again.) I am not-I am not into anything weird. y’know? just-just normal sex. (katie is uncomfortable.) so, I am going to grab my coat. (does so, leaving katie and rachel alone.)
so, you had a good day huh? big commission; picked up a daddy.
oh yeah! yeah please, you guys have fun.
oh and it was great to see you too. and you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
oh okay, i see what you are doing there.
i can not even believe this! i really come off that badly?
oh! it is okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
oh good. good, because I am sure this interview is going to last a couple of weeks.
all right, do not freak out! okay? i-i will help you. how long before you have to leave?
an hour.
i can not help you.
phoebe!
all right, all right, we will just do our best. okay? so let us say I am the interviewer and I am meeting you for the first time. okay. "hi! come on in, I am uh, regina philange."
chandler bing.
bing, what an unusual name.
well you should meet my uncle, bada. (pause) I will let myself out.
hi.
when you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
cheese makes me thirsty.
all right.
oh no! i do not know anything about cooking. i had to ask someone what it is called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
i-i-I am sorry, your-your mouth was full, i did not hear what you said. umm, hats off to who now?
that is right.
…i think you will find if i come to work here, i do not micro-manage. i do not shy away from delegating.
um-hmm, that is good to know. but let us stop focusing on what you do not do, and start focusing on what you do do.
(suppressing a smile) what i do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
i see. nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
hardest thing I have ever done in my life.
you got to go!
oh! (stands up.)
okay, do not worry. you are ready.
really?
absolutely! just fight all your natural instincts and you will be great.
okay.
y’know, you called me that before so i-i took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (hands it to her.)
wow! a star! (the class glares at her.) i know you all hate me and-and I am sorry, but i do not care.
i can an a? in-in school? (to joey) hey, I am a dork.
joey! I am so proud of you!
excuse me? he does not even know what he is doing!
i do! I am a professional chef! (the class gasps.) oh relax! it is not a courtroom drama!
yeah!
I am-I am sorry, it is just that umm… well i-i cook at this restaurant, alessandro’s, and umm i just got a really bad review…
you do?
oh, I am totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
okay then, i do not stink. I am a good chef. okay. (starts to leave.)
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! i do not want to go. I am having fun.
hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it is time to go, it is time to go. (starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)
…also i was the point person on my company’s transition from the kl-5 to gr-6 system.
that i did. that i did.
(nervous) my duties? (trying not to crack a joke) all right.
(trying not to laugh) i see.
(really try not to laugh) good to know.
no do not i beg of you!
(relieved) really?!
yeah i got to say thank you, i was really nervous. y’know I have been told i come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (the interviewer does not understand) duties. (still does not.) duties! (still does not.) poo. (still does not.)
oh my god this does not count! okay? the interview was over, that was the real chandler bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! call security! there is a crazy guy out in the hall!
I will look forward to your call. (walks away.)
hey.
hi! you are back from your date!
how are you?
I am fine, but that is not important. what is important is how was she?
uhh, it was fun. we, we just had coffee.
oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
what is uh, what is going on? do you not, do you not like katie?
no! no, she is—she was nice. i mean, she is a little slutty, but who is not?
i liked her.
of course you did ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you indiana jones!
did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
no! it is just that, kate bothered me.
why? what was wrong with her?
there was nothing wrong with her! all right? she was perfectly lovely!
okay, so what is the matter?
i do not want you to date her!
(laughs) why? what, what are you jealous?
yes! and not because i want you to go out with me, but because i do not want you to go out with anybody! okay? i know it is a terrible thing to even think this, and it is completely inappropriate, but i want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I am very sorry, but that is just the way that i feel.
okay.
what?!
i will not date. I will uh, I will be here, with you, all the time.
really? but I am being so unreasonable.
true, but you are allowed to be unreasonable. you are having our baby.
(starting to cry) oh ross, thank you. thank you. (they hug.)
do you feel better?
no, not really. you are pressing the baby into my bladder and now i have to pee. sorry. (she gets up and starts for the bathroom.)
uh rach?
yeah. (stops and starts doing the i-have-to-go-to-the-bathroom dance.)
just one thing umm…
uh-huh.
we live together. you are having our baby. I am not going to see anybody else. are you-are you sure you do not want something more?
(pause) wow! i do not know, maybe. I am…
oh-oh, rach! i was just messin’ around! (she is stunned) like you did last night when i had to pee?
(laughs) i knew that! i knew that! i was just messin’ with you too!
(pause) okay. okay. because for a minute you said you…
oh no-no-no-no, no!
…that you actually…
no that is just—(laughs)—that is just ‘because I am such a good messer!
rach?
yeah?
the bathroom?
right! (heads for the bathroom.)
well i had a great time! learned how to bake, ate great food, that is the first a I have gotten since seventh grade, and i did not have to sleep with the teacher this time.
oh, look! acting for beginners! want to feel good about yourself?
what the hell!
okay.
yeah, this was a stupid idea. (exits.)
(coming in from his bedroom) what is that?
treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
maybe he found you flip-flop.
hey!
whoa! is this porn? what did i do? i must have hit something on the remote.
do we pay for this?
no, we did not even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.
maybe we should not pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
maybe we should not pay our gas bill? (stops and thinks about what he just said.)
yeah, joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
like finding money with naked people on it!
(to chandler) why would he turn off the tv? (chandler shrugs.)
all right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (she makes a move for the remote.)
we do not know what could make this go away.
yeah, so no one touches the remote. and no one touches the tv!
and no one touches the air around the tv!
imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
well at least, I am going to mute it.
we still have porn.
hey.
(entering, carrying her massage table) hi!
hi!
honey, what are you doing? that is too heavy.
yeah.
give it here. (she takes the table.) oh, god. (and gives it to monica right away.)
okay.
ohh, I am getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. y’know, i have to find a job where i carrying a smaller table. (she goes over and stands in front of the tv.)
or a job where you do not have to carry a table.
you mean like a doctor?
pheebs! you are blocking the porn! look out!
ohh! (she moves.) oh my. oh, that reminds me, i have to see my ob-gyn today.
hi.
hi.
so uh, emily just went to the airport.
oh. why did not you take her?
eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. and y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…
you must feel horrible. hey! the guys have free porn!
(thinks about it.) nah.
hey, cheer up! you are going to see her again, right?
well i, that is the thing, i do not know! i mean, whenever i brought it up with her she said, (in a british accent.) "this is so fantastic! why do we have to talk about the future? let us just enjoy…"
(interrupting him) no-no-no, do not-do not do the accent. you have got to see her again.
and why do you care so much?
because! you could get to live out my fantasy!
you had fantasies about emily?
no! y’know, the fantasy! meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that ukrainian kid?
yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
ahh.
do you love her?
we said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?
you love her!
what-what is love really?
ohhh, i knew you loved her! then you need to go to the airport and tell her. you are probably just going to catch her just as she is about to go to the gate. you are going to call out her name and say, "i love you!" and she is going to say, "i love you, too!" and you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
i am a good kisser.
then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in… (ross looks at her.) I have been watching too much porn.
is that the heartbeat?
oh my god!
oh wow! this is so cool.
why do not take care of this one, and should i get pregnant again, I will hold onto your card, okay?
three? you guys were worried i would not even have one!
well, yeah.
well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
oh my god! oh my god! oh my god!! so i-i mean so in a few months I am going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! oh! oh! and it is going to be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
what do you know?!
ooh! hi!
oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you are umm, you are walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "oh, that is nice?"
okay, yeah well, good news, you are going to have three babies.
oh god, I am so glad you guys are happy, i was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
no, no maybe ‘because it is harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…
no, back to happy. back to happy!
no you can not quit college! no! you are in college? really?
you can not give up on your dream.
emily! (runs up.)
i just, i had to see you one more time before you took-off.
that is, that is, that is a big candy bar. (she is holding one of those huge toblerone bars.) i had the most amazing time with you.
(stops her) wait uh, listen. i-i, i have to tell you something. umm, I have been thinking, I am just going to come out and say it. okay? i-i-i ah, i-i think i love you.
that is no problem.
what is that song? it has been in my head all day long.
it is the theme from good will humping.
y’know who does not even like dirty movies? my new boyfriend joshua.
yeah right.
no, he told me. he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
yes!
yeah, he likes porn.
where ya going?
I am going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (as she exits, phoebe enters.) hey, pheebs!
hey.
hey!
how did it go with frank and alice?
well, frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! i need to make a lot of money really fast, and i had an idea that i want to talk to you (points to chandler) about, ‘because you work for a big company. okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
they do not really talk to us about that kind of stuff. i can get you some free white out though.
ohh! did you do what i said? did-did-did you tell her?
i did.
and well, what did she say?
thank you.
oh, you are totally welcome! what did she say?
she said, "thank you." i said, "i love you." and she said, "thank you."
whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
what do i do now?
you play hard to get.
she already lives in london.
then you go to tokyo.
all right look, forget it, forget it. you told her you love her, it is over.
it is not over! you are over!
what?
you know!
okay. (pause) good one.
it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. and the reason why she could not, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! come on now go! go! (tries to push ross out the door.)
okay! okay! but if she does not call, it is definitely over! no, wait. wait. unless, eventually, i call her, y’know just to she what is going on, and, and she says she will call me back, but then she does not. then it is over.
way to be strong, man!
hey!
hi! listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? we need a porn break. we spent the last two hours watching in & out & in, again.
well, so, why do not you just turn it off?
because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
(entering carrying a case) ooh, good, you are hear! okay.
hey!
hi!
well, what-what ‘cha got there?
oh this, well I am glad you asked. (she opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) now, do not you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (she efficiently cuts it in half.) ahh! now, i know what you are thinking…
pregnant woman slays four?
phoebe, they did not make you pay for those knives, did they?
no!
are you sure?
no!
honey, you are not going to make enough money to help frank and alice just by selling knives.
no-no, i know that, but i just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
what is the second part of your plan?
my saturn dealership.
(answers the phone.) hello?
emily, hi! uh, how-how was you flight?
no, no, that-that, that is all right. umm, I am just glad you called.
does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america?
she does not know which one of us she wants, me or this colin guy.
this is not how it is supposed to go, there can not be another guy.
well…
of course there is another guy!! this is even more perfect! now you have to prove your love!
I am not proving anything. okay, I am done listening to you. if i had not let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, i never would have put my fist through the wall!
you put your fist through the wall?
no, i missed and hit the door. but, it opened really hard!
you have to go to london!
what?
yeah, you have to go fight for her!
oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. yeah. ‘because you already told her you love her and she did not say it back, then she called you and told you that there is another guy, so yeah, go to london that will scare her!
when rachel was with paulo, what did you do?
i made fun of his accent.
you sat back and let him have her, you did not fight at all. am i right? do you want the same thing to happen with emily?
no.
all right then, go fight for her! go to london! i mean, that could be you and emily! (points to the tv.) that, but-but nicer. just, go to london!
really?
come on! surprise her! show up at her doorstep! do not let her go without a fight!
all right. all right, I am going to do it!
all right.
I am going to, I am going to go to london and I am going to fight for her.
okay, good luck!
ross! ross! if you are going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those toblerone bars? (chandler nods his head no.)
hey!
ooh-ooh! i did it! i did it! i figured out a way to make money! I am going to open up my own massage place and frank’s going to help me! and! we can work it around his schedule so he does not have to quit school!
that is sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
I am telling it! I am telling it!
okay.
okay. you know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so i just figured we could combine the two, okay, i give the massages and frank drives! i can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I have got?
a place where no one will ever get out alive?
no! think about it, it is a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it is…
(interrupting) relaxi-taxi!
the name was my favourite part!
well, well i can up with it!
you did not!!!! oh! no! you came up with relaxi cab! that is not good.
well, i…
hello.
(on phone) hey.
oh my god! ross, are you in england? was emily surprised?
no, because she has not come home yet. and she has not been home all night! she is obviously staying with that other guy, and I am the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
all right. when is, when is the next flight out?
about four hours.
okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she does not show up by then, then just come on home.
hey, tell him about relaxi-taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that is better than relaxi cab.
okay, it is not relaxi cab. it is relaxicab, like taxicab.
oh, that is better.
are we in london?
what are you doing here? you can not be here!
(pause) nothing. no, nothing.
oh, you came to tell him you love him! i knew it! (points at chandler) i was right! (points to emily) I am right, right?
oh.
(yelling, thinking emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to new york.) i love you too! I am, I am going to call you right now from the phone booth! (realises) you can not hear me. (goes to make his call.)
hi.
ohh! thank you.
hey.
hey.
i was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she did not ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
same kind of thing happened to me! woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
what, no, "nice apartment, i bet the bedrooms are huge?"
noo! nothing!
y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
i think you are right.
all right, ready?
one.
two.
that is kind of nice.
yeah, that is kind of a relief.
yeah.
you want to see if we still have it?
yeah.
free porn!!!
yeah!!
we have free porn here!!!
how did the job stuff go?
he offered me one.
(gasps) you know what? this calls for a bottle of israels finest.
the job is in paris. (we see ross stare in disbelief)
oh, god! please, somebody say something.
so if you take this job you will be moving to paris?
or facing a bitch of a commute.
i know, it is huge, and it is scary, and it is... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. and I have already talked to them about our situation with emma, and they said they will do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
okay.
i mean, I will fly back and forth, they will fly you out... anything we want.
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (monica looks at him and can not really place what he just said)
all right, we will work it out.
thank you! thank you!
yeah, yeah! (they hug) you sure this is what you want?
i think it is. (ross looks very sad. phoebe and joey enter.)
ooh, what is going on?
i got a really incredible job offer.
hey, great! all right!
good for you!
it is in paris.
what? no, no, no! no, no... no... no, no... no, too much is changing, okay? first, phoebe getting married (to phoebe) congratulations! (pointing to monica and chandler)... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
hey, this afternoon you said you would be supportive...
well, it comes and goes. i would not trust it.
look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. and it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
of course we can. congratulations. (they hug, but joey shakes his head.) yay! (she gestures joey to come and join in) joey...
no, no, no. my hugs are reserved for people staying in america.
(walking towards joey) joey, it would mean so...
hey! no! get your france-going-arms away from me. (he walks out, and rachel follows him)
joey...
you okay with this?
well, it makes me feel sad, but...
talking to ross.
i see.
well, rachel moving to another country? not being able to see her every day. how can i be okay with this?
i know, but what are we going to do? she really needs this job.
do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
how is that going to happen?
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
i do not know. i could talk to her boss. yeah! i met him at that christmas party. we really hit it off.
you mean the guy who kept calling you ron?
i did not say we were brothers.
hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next door to the one that we are buying in westchester? just went on the market. i want to take a look at it, but chandler does not.
we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we are easily confused. we are not very bright.
but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look?
what do you think pheebs?
well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins... anyway... hey, is not joey's agent estelle leonard?
yeah.
she died.
you are kidding!
that is terrible!
yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic. (chandler and monica look puzzled) oh, wait a minute, i read the wrong one.
oh yeah?
yeah, she was just an agent.
joey's going to be *so* upset.
i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic.
well, we cannot tell joey about this. he is already flipping out about everything that is changing. this will push him over the edge.
seriously, you do not think we should tell him?
well, not for a little while. let us just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
what if he reads it in the paper?
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we are okay.
yeah, I am a friend of rachel green's. uhm, actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago.
close. ron. (shakes hands)
uhm, well... I am here to see if you will give rachel her job back.
oh, no. at first i have to get you to agree. then we will see if she wants to come back.
look, she loved her job here. and let us face it: you are not going to find anyone who did it as well as she did it. is not that true?
(surprised) huh, i took a shot there.
i see... thanks very much. (he gets up and walks to the door. on his way out he looks at the photographs mr zelner has near his door. he picks one up.) is this your son?
oh, nothing, it is just, it is close to ron. does he.. does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. (mr. zellner looks shocked). i just heard it as you must have heard it and that is not good. let me start again. I am a paleontologist, you will be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
you let rachel come back, and it is done.
yeah! yes! thank you! this is great. thank you so much. and i swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
he will be fine.
hey phoebe.
hey. everything ok?
I am just mad at my agent.
estelle? why?
there is a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i did not even be put up for it! she would better have a good reason.
I am guessing she does.
well (taking his cell phone out of a pocket) I am want to hear it, because she keeps doing this.
well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. all right, i got to go. just listen. promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
ok. why?
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. (she leaves)
i love that saying!
hello?
i was just going to call you! that is weird.
yeah, actually i am!
that is it? you know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
no, no, look. all I am saying is that you are my agent, ok? and you are not getting me into any auditions and I am tired of it.
I am saying that… (pause). this is not working for me anymore, ok? estelle, you are fired. goodbye. (he hangs up the phone).
man, tough week for estelle!
hi.
hi.
emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. you know she can not sleep without it.
oh, well, she is asleep now. stop forcing that thing on her.
ok.
oh, you are not going to believe what happened to me today! ralph lauren called, and gave me my job back!
nooo!
yee. i mean, it was so weirdest thing. they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! i mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
so, you are not going to paris.
no, I am still going.
wh… wh…what?
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! is not that great?
yeeeah! (they high-five)
hi. we are buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
thanks.
it feels like we are cheating on our house. and if we are going to cheat, should not it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house will not do?
ours is so much better! this living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! what a hole!
love it!
they could be our neighbors, what are they like?
hey joey, want come with me to… are you ok?
yeah, i just… i just feel bad about firing estelle. this is got to be killing her.
no, that would not kill her. ordinary embolism might.
i do not know. she is got to be taking it hard, i was like her only client. except for this guy who eats paper. and I am guessing he eats more money than he makes. look, i know she is not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I am going to call her and hire her again.
no, no, no! do not call her! you wait for her to call you (joey considers it)
why?
because patience is the road to understanding (she thinks) which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
(impressed) you blow me away.
(picking up her bag) all right, so promise you are going to wait for her to call you?
i promise. and that means, never having to give a reason. (phoebe stops herself from laughing and leaves)
and yet i never run into beyonce!
(at janice's punching) do not, do not! (looks disgusted)
no, actually, we are buying the house next door. (janice gasps)
(to monica and with bulging eyes) why!?
(looks confused and scared) i do not know why.
this can not be happening!
okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. maybe the janice's will not get it! maybe the other couple will.
the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the hitlers.
(thinks a little more) okay, okay, (clapping her hands) all right. what if we got both houses? huh? we can turn this house into a guest house.
that is a great idea! and by the way, i do not mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
okay, you come up with an idea.
alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. we can still get out.
but we love our house.
will we love it so much with her next door? and she is going to be louder out here too. just the crickets and (apes janice's voice) "oh my god"!
okay, but if we do not get this house, she is stil going to show up wherever we go! i mean, at least if she is here, it eliminates the element of suprise. i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. (she shows this with her index finger, mimicking it pushing something up)
(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she is right) well, we have to do something. we can not have her living next door. (janice's laughs loudly outside) oh, that does it too. (motions with his index finger like monica did)
(enters) it is me. ron. (mr. zellner looks annoyed) look, i um, i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
just hear me out. how would you feel about offering her a raise? (looks hopeful)
perhaps i can persuade you. what if you can give your son this (takes a huge egg out of his back) genuine pterodactyl egg (whispers) replica.
huh? so? we have a deal?
yes! yes!
oh, (grins) believe me, the ladies, they love it!
good, because the ladies, not so much. (shakes his head, give him a thumbs up and leaves)
oh my god. (still in shock when his mobile rings, he picks it up) hello?
(on the other side of the line, still pretending to be estelle) joey, it is estelle. (joey's eyes bulge up, he looks afraid)
estelle?
yeah, i wanted to call and tell you that there is no hard feelings for firing me.
(still scared) ok-ay. i just, i can not believe you are calling me?
well, i did not think i should just drop by...
no, no, no! (starts looking around the room, terrified) do not drop by, do not drop by!
anyway, you did what you had to do. I am okay.
can i ask you something? uhm, what is it like there?
(looks around) it is alright. look kiddo, i got to go. good luck with the career. you are going to be huge.
thanks for everything estelle. bye. (hangs up and reads the phone display) "out of area". boy, I will say.
the hitlers will be so disappointed.
wait! i just want you to know that... I am so happy you are going to be here.
because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
i never stopped loving you.
yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein.
now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and monica never have to know a thing.
(stunned) obviously.
do not say that. do not tangle the dream and take it away.
i understand.
(speaking as in pain) they are never coming down now.
hi!
hey!
you are never going to believe what happened to me today.
what?
ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money.
they did?
yeah. it was the weirdest thing. zelner called me and he said we will do everything we can to get you back. and that i should thank some ron... i do not even know what department that guy's in.
so, what are you going to do?
well, i took it.
that is great! so you are staying in new york!
you are excited, right?
(hesitant) ye-ah. yeah! you know, the money's great. it is certainly the easier choice...
right!
yeah, you know, was i looking forward to going to paris? sure. you know, was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? ooh, absolutely... oh...! yeah, but you know, this is... it is fine. I am fine going back to a job where I have pretty much gotten everything out of that i possibly can... (she sits down, and ross who is stunned to hear all this follows her example)
uhm, i had not no you... i had no idea you were so excited about paris. uhm, i mean, you said you were scared.
well yeah, but i mean, it was good scared though, you know? like when i-moved-to-new-york scared. or uhm, when i-found-out-i-was-going to-have-emma scared... but this is... fine. this is going to be good. (they both stare around)
(after a long pause) you should go.
what?
it is what you want. you should go.
you really think so?
i really do.
but i already told zelner that i would come back...
(picks up a skull of some carnivore from his side table and puts it in the same bag in which he brought the pterodactyl egg to zelner) I am sure he will understand.
all right. all right! I am going to do it. I am going to go to paris.
yeah...
yeah! I am going to paris. thank you, ross!
yeah, yeah, oh! (they hug)
oh! oh, I am so happy.
then I am happy too. (they are still hugging - fade out)
thank you all for coming. we are here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... (joey looks at the photograph) ..inside. as estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. (joey looks for his notes. the man next to him is chewing something.) dude, where is my speech? (the man swallows something and looks at joey.) that is entertaining. al zebooker everybody. (he applauds and al shows that there is nothing left in his mouth.)
(entering) hey everybody! happy thanksgiving!
no, no, no. no-no-no.
what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year?
no, we are playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes.
what? that is like insanely easy!
now, that is a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to monica).
it is a stupid game and i was not playing against other people, so technically i did not lose.
what? you forgot fourteen states?
nobody cares about the dakotas. (that is true in so many ways, trust me, I have lived in one and been to the other.)
oh, okay, time's up!
all right, i got 48.
oh that is not bad, pheebs?
oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of celery, and i have one: regular celery.
okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, joey?
say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game.
wow, how many have you got?
fifty-six!
hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports-team!
does south oregon have a sports-team? (joey strikes one from his list) there you go.
(counting the place settings) how come we have one extra place setting?
because you invited your assistant.
oh, right. sorry. but tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he is spending thanksgiving with her.
oh! why did not you tell me? i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know... you are food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
now you think i would not enjoy that, because it is so fake, (laughs) but i still do.
regular celery! (starts to write that on her list) oh, i already have that. (she gets up and heads for her room)
done! with time a-to-spare.
oooh that may be a new world's record (looks at his watch and picks up ross' pad)
you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it is kind of disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can not name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" hmm?
uh, magellan? you got 46 states. (smiles and hands ross back his pad)
what? that is impossible.
46. wow! who is well educated now, mr. i-forgot-ten-states?
all right, I am out of oven space. I am going to turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food!
i am only one man! (monica heads out) okay ross, time is up!
no, just give me another minute.
look ross, if you do not know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself.
this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner.
okay, but if you can not…no dinner!
you are on!
(gets up) all right. do not look at my list, ross, because there is a lot on there that you do not have.
(entering, to joey and rachel) hey, did you guys know, that your oven does not work?
but the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
ross, I am going to use yours, okay?
pshhshhh!
chandler? can you give me a hand? (grabs her jacket)
sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
do not worry, chandler, it is not a globe of the united states.
hey you guys I am going to go out and take a walk.
phoebe, why is your bag moving?
oh, it is not!
seriously, it is moving!
what the hell is in there?
it is just my knitting that is all! (a dog sticks its head out of phoebe's bag. everyone looks puzzled.) yes! i knit this. I am very good.
ross’s apartment is nice! how come we do not hang out here more often?
i do not know. maybe it is because it smells a little weird. it is like old pumpkins or something.
that is my pie!
which smells delicious!
uh-oh! uh-oh!
what?
we left joey alone with the food! (walks towards the window and looks out) yep! yep, i knew it! there he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
(answering the phone) hi geller-bing residence. how can i help?
phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
I am sorry, who is this?
phoebe, there is a dog sitting on my couch!
tell her, I am allergic, and i will sue!
no, there is no dog here?
yes there is! he is black and white and shaggy and [cut to monica’s apartment] he is sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand.
oh my god! where are you? (looks around.)
I will be right there!
(phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. she gasps.) they are here already? how are they doing this?
(gets up and opens the door) hi tag! what are you doing here?
well, sure! come in! (he enters) well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
oh, I am sorry.
ohio!! thank you!
huh! where is the dog?!
what dog? there-there is no dog here.
yeah that dog left!
(walks to phoebe's door) phoebe! phoebe, open up!
there is no dog in here.
phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
no that is just me coughing! (doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. phoebe comes out of the room.) oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room.
what is it doing here?
well, I am watching it for some friends who went out of town. wait. (she bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) hello, my name is clunkers. may i please stay with you nice people?
oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic!
extremely allergic, okay? if I am anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
that is odd, because this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
(gasping) really?
chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you have not had a reaction, maybe you are not allergic to this dog?
well, it still has to go, right?
okay, it is um…
(interrupting him) do not do it!
do not do what?
(to joey) i have to! okay? it is time! (joey shrugs as if to say, "do what you have to do") okay, i hate dogs.
are you crazy?
are you out of your mind?
why?
told ya. (waves bye-bye.)
they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can not tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
right, they are scary. (he jumps up, screaming) ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies?
(scared) is there a puppy here?
(to tag) okay, you are new!
look, chandler, i told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. it is like ross not likin’ ice cream.
you do not like ice cream?
it is too cold.
okay, it is just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
(to phoebe) it hurts my teeth.
and i do not want to say this, i do not you guys to hate me, but uh, i do not think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go. (an awkward silence ensues.) oh my god!!
how can i not get this? I am a college professor; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s.
1250.
damn, i forgot you were here.
all right. we are going to take clunkers to ross’s. we will be back in a minute. (gets up with monica to do so.)
oh, wait before you guys go, can i just ask you a question?
yeah.
when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
oh, I would say about a month.
really? I would say 3 to 4.
half hour. (rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)
interesting.
when it is your assistant, i would say never.
all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you? all right? because if he does not like you, this is all a moo-point.
huh. a moo-point?
yeah, it is like a cow's opinion. it just does not matter. it is moo.
(to monica and phoebe) have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
please, do not listen to joey, okay. would you look at him? he-he is obviously depressed. he is away from his family; he is spending thanksgiving with strangers.   what he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
you are right, I am sorry. thank you. okay, that is what I am going to do.
fine! take their advice. no one ever listens to me. when the package is this pretty, no one cares what is inside.
hey!
how are you holding up?
yeah? I am sorry about your girlfriend.
so were you guys together a long time?
now that she broke up with you?
yeah. hmmmm.
no…yeah, all the time, constantly. it is terrifying. but you know that i figure it…it has to work out.
because, uh—it has to.
yeah, i know, i do. i really do.
well, what is a boss for? hug it out! (they hug)
(through the window) all right, he likes you back! huh? told ya, you should go for it!
(realizes what he said) street noise drowned any of that out? (rachel moves madly towards him) no, all right, i see you later, okay... (turns away embarrassed)
uh, yeah, well, see, he… joey knows, that I am-I am very insecure about my back and, and…you are hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
no? (he shakes his head) all right, here is the truth um, joey said what he said, because um, I am attracted to you.
yeah, i admit it. i have a crush on you, and uh, and, and i know that is crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing i want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
what?
okay, that is going to take them a minute. do you have anything else you want to get off your chest?
(she hurries after him) wait, we still have time to talk and they are-they are not even in the car yet! (she takes a quick look down the street.) oh look, there they go, okay. (she hurries in, too)
okay phoebe, we should probably go back now.
(doing clunkers) please do not leave me, I will be lonely.
stop it. stop! okay let us go. we can be strong.
yeah, okay.
oh my god! did you hear that? she said monica! (she goes back to clunkers again) oooh, i can not leave her!
you know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and chandler would not even know.
that is not going to work.
I have had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea. he is not so smart.
hey! i did not know either.
yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, did not you?
yeah, i knew.
where is chandler?
(comes out of the bathroom) here i am.
wash your hands!!!
how did you…know? (heads back into the bathroom)
hey! what is she doing back here?
relax, ross. she is not made of ice cream!
hey look, phoebe. i, uh, i laid out the states geographically...
(interrupts him) no, no, we do not really have time for this right now. okay, we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom.
yeah, but, but look what I am...
see, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (she rushes into her room)
(comes out of the bathroom) where is monica?
um, in phoebe's room. you can not go in there.
why not?
monica's crying. she is very upset about this whole clunkers thing.
well, i, i should go in there.
no. no, no. she does not want to see you right now.
why not?
because you sent away the dog!
this is ridiculous. (he heads for phoebe's bedroom)
oh, is it? is it? look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover. and, uh, one day, my dad decides, he does not like dogs. so monica and her friend…phyllis…take away the dog. and that was the last time we ever saw him. do not you see? this is just like that. only with a few details changed.
(entering) okay, I am in my sweat pants. bring on the food! (sees that chandler has a worried look on his face) what is the matter?
monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away.
so? bring the dog back, you are a hero.
yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
chandler, it is like a big gerbil.
and that does not scare you? (he walks out)
ross, you need some help?
from you? (he does a weird desperate laughter, like he is almost crying) yes, please!
(sits down next to ross) first of all, utah? dude, you can not just make stuff up!
i hate america! when i finish this game, i swear i am moving.
hey! tag's still talking to the police.
yeah, ohh! why, damnit, why did i open my mouth? (in a girlish voice) i have a crush on you; i am attracted to you. (back to normal again) gee, i-i know that i freaked him out
if you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) hey, is chandler here?
no, no he went for a walk.
okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
(gasps) hi!
oh no-no-no-no-no-no-no! he went over to ross' to bring the dog back here!
oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
you think?
hi, honey.
please, please, please, do not be mad at me.
what? why, why would...
(interrupts her, to monica) shh, wait and see. maybe we will, maybe we will not.
okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back clunkers. y’know, for you, and…(clears his throat) i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which fyi ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. i could not find him, and i am so, so, so, sorry. but i do know where we could all go ease the pain. (points up and then over to the street)
we have good news, look whose back!
(uncovers the dog) hi!
clunkers?! oh my god!
that is right, she came back all by herself.
it is a thanksgiving miracle!
(to clunkers) it is so good to see you!
yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building. oh, the things she must have seen! and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(realizes, that chandler starts to not believing her) i went to far, did not i? when should i have stopped?
okay, maybe this is so hard, because there are not 50 states. let me tell you something, i have 49 states, and there are no more! i-i think, i should be able to eat something.
it is up to you.
oh, hi! how are you doing?
oh.
tag? y-you are going? (comes over to tag) uh we did not, uh we did not get the chance to talk. uh, so, where did you say you are from again?
ah, what good are you. (walks back to his map dejectedly.)
look, um, i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
ah, i-i never should have said what i said. it—y’know what? it just does not matter how i feel. i mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what i would love is just to go to work on monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? big day monday lots to do. so, we are okay?
oh, god, i know it, that i freaked you out.
really?
okay, well, that is one less thing we have to do on monday.
delaware! (starting to cry.) delaware!
all right.
(hands chandler his pad and walks in) i want my turkey now!
you got it. (starts looking at the pad, while ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) you got nevada twice.
(pauses) i know.
yeah. (throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
hey.
(reading the program) ooh! look! look! look! look, there is joey's picture! this is so exciting!
you can always spot someone who is never seen one of his plays before. notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
the exclamation point in the title scares me. (gesturing) y'know, it is not just freud, it is freud!
oh, shhh, shh. magic is about to happen.
vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (he goes into a song and dance number.)
god. i feel violated.
did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
(staring at a woman across the room) ross, ten of the clock.
is it? feels like two.
no, ten of the clock.
what?
(sighs and gestures to explain) there is a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten of the clock!
oh. hel-lo!
she is amazing! she makes the women that i dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
well, go over to her! she is not with anyone.
oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'excuse me. blarrglarrghh.'
oh, c'mon. she is a person, you can do it!
oh please, could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up here.
he could never get a woman like that in a million years.
thank you, buddy.
oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
you could do that!
y'think?
oh god, i can not believe I am even considering this... I am very very aware of my tongue...
c'mon! c'mon!
here goes. (he walks over to her but just stands there.)
hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... chandler! chandler is my name, and, uh...(he clears his throat noisily)...hi.
yes, yes i did, but what i did not say was what i was about to say, what i wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (he walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
whadja think?
c'mon, you guys, it was not that bad. it was better than that thing i did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
(running back) she said yes!! she said yes!! (to joey) awful play, man. whoah. (to all) her name's aurora, and she is italian, and she pronounces my name 'chand-lrr'. 'chand-lrr'. i think i like it better that way. (to joey) oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (he fishes a card out of his pocket.)
what is it?
the estelle leonard talent agency. wow, an agency left me its card! maybe they want to sign me!
based on this play? ...based on this play!
hey, kids.
(reading monica's palm) no, because this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
well, i can not believe I have been here almost seven seconds and you have not asked me how my date went.
oh, right, right. how was your date, 'chand-lrr'?
it was unbelievable. i-I have never met anyone like her. she is had the most amazing life! she was in the israeli army...
alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
we talked 'til like two. it was this perfect evening... more or less.
oh, I am sorry, so 'we' is?
who is rick?
who is rick?
oh, so you are divorced?
oh, I am sorry, then you are widowed?...hopefully?
so tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
ethan? there is, there is an ethan?
so explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
...hm.
oh. I am sorry it did not work out.
what 'not work out'? I am seeing her again on thursday. did not you listen to the story?
did not you listen to the story? i mean, this is twisted! how could you get involved with a woman like this?
well, y'know, i had some trouble with it at first too, but the way i look at it is, i get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. i mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
oh, yeah. that is not true. ross, is this your fantasy?
no, of course not! (thinks) ...yeah, yeah, it is.
what? so you guys do not mind going out with someone else who is going out with someone else?
i could not do it.
good for you, joey.
when I am with a woman, i need to know that I am going out with more people than she is.
well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. i mean, anthropologically speaking-
fine. fine, alright, now you will never know.
we are kidding. c'mon, tell us!
alright. there is a theory, put forth by richard leakey-
tah-daaah!
are we greeting each other this way now? because i like that.
look! i cleaned! i did the windows, i did the floors... i even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, i do not know what that is for.
oh yeah, nobody knows. and we are not supposed to ask.
well, whaddya think?
...oh! i-i see you moved the green ottoman.
how-how did that happen?
i dunno.. i-i thought it looked better there. and i- and also, it is an extra seat around the coffee table.
yeah, yeah, it is interesting.. but y'know what? just for fun, let us see what it looked like in the old spot. (she moves it.) alright, just to compare. let us see. well, it looks good there too. let us just leave it there for a while.
(to rachel) i can not believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
thank god you did not try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she will scratch your eyes right out.
you guys, i am not that bad!
yeah, you are, monica. remember when i lived with you? you were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) ree! ree! ree! ree!
that is so unfair!
oh c'mon! when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that was not raggedy!
okay, so I am responsible, I am organised. but hey, i can be a kook.
alright, you madcap gal. try to imagine this. the phone bill arrives, but you do not pay it right away.
why not?
because you are a kook! instead you wait until they send you a notice.
i could do that.
okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and i buy laundry detergent, but it is not the one with the easy-pour spout.
why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder.
someone is left a glass on the coffee table. there is no coaster. it is a cold drink, it is a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
stop it!! ...oh my god. it is true! who am i?
monica? you are mom.
ree! ree! ree! ree! ree!
(on phone) uh huh.. uh huh... oh my god! okay! okay, I will be there! (he hangs up and to all.) that was my agent. (he tosses and catches the phone.) my agent has just gotten me a job...in the new al pacino movie!
well, what is the part?
can you believe this? al pacino! this guy's the reason i became an actor! "I am out of order? pfeeeh. you are out of order! this whole courtroom's out of order!"
seriously, what-what is the part?
"just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in!"
c'mon, seriously, joey, what is the part?
...I am his (mumbles)
..you are, you are 'mah mah mah' what?
...I am his butt double. 'kay? i play al pacino's butt. alright? he goes into the shower, and then- I am his butt.
(trying not to laugh) oh my god.
c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that is big!
oh no, it is terrific, it is... it is... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you have finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
okay, okay, fine! make jokes, i do not care! this is a big break for me!
you are right, you are right, it is...so you going to invite us all to the big opening?
alright, alright, alright...
here. i need to borrow some moisturizer.
for what?
whaddya think? today's the big day!
oh my god. okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just do not ever tell me what you did in there.
thank you! (he goes into the bathroom.)
where is joey? his mom's on the phone.
he is in the bathroom. i do not think you want to go in there!
c'mon, we are roommates! (he goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) my eyes!! my eyes!!
i warned you...
who is being loud?
oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i want to borrow a coupla things, aurora spent the night, i really want to make her breakfast.
oh, you got the whole night, huh?
yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know.. (he starts to raid the fridge.)
ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment?
no, no resentment, believe me, it is worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you will remember for the rest of your life? well, every- single- second is like that with aurora.. and I have just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. monica, can you help me with the door? (he has armloads of stuff.)
sure. oh, um, chandler? y'know, the-the old monica would-would remind you to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush...but I am not going to do that.
uh, listen, i just want to thank you for this great opportunity.
me?
right. okay. losing the robe. (he takes off the robe.) and the robe is lost.
well, I am- I am showering.
oh. well, the way i see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? i mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... i think his butt would be angry here.
i was going for quiet desperation. but if you have to ask...
god, i love these fingers...
no, actually i meant my fingers. look at  them, look at how happy they are.
oh no nonononononnononono, do not go.. (he kisses her and pulls her back down.)
do not go.
(to himself) too bad, she is leaving.
well, i thought- i thought you talked to rick.
what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you!
i know there will be many moments in the years to come when I will regret asking the following question, but- and andrew is?
oh, so what you are saying is you are not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?
well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
you.
nono, just you.
lose the other guys.
c'mon, we are great together, why not?
...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it is like I am two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there is this other guy. actually it is the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... and he is saying, y'know, 'this is too hard! get out! get out!'
i do not know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they do not exactly let each other finish...
...the second guy.
sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
look at it this way: you dumped her. right? i mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... tell me why you did this again?
hey, waitwait, are not you the guy that plays the butt in the new al pacino movie?
nope.
no? what happened, big guy?
(to ross) "big guy?"
it felt like a 'big guy' moment.
i got fired.
yeah, they said i acted too much with it. i told everybody about this! now everybody's going to go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
oh, joey, you know what, no-one is going to be able to tell.
my mom will.
something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
y'know, I have done nothing but crappy plays for six years. and i finally get my shot, and i blow it!
maybe this was not your shot.
yeah, i mean... i think when it is your shot, y'know, you-you know it is your shot. did it... feel like your shot..?
hard to tell, i was naked.
no, i do not think this was your shot. i mean, i do not even think you just get one shot. i really believe big things are going to happen for you, i do! you have got to just keep thinking about the day that some kid is going to run up to his friends and go 'i got the part! i got the part! I am going to be joey tribbiani's ass!'.
yeah? that is so nice! (they hug.)
I am sorry, joey. I am going to go to bed, guys.
uh, mon, you-you going to leave your shoes out here?
(determined) uh-huh!
really? just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
does not matter, I will get  them tomorrow. or not. whenever. (he goes to her room.)
she is a kook.
(hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) if it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. no. do not do this. this is stupid! i do not have to prove anything, I am going to go get them...but then everyone will know. unless i get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...i need help! (she buries her head in her pillow.)
(picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) hello?
(in her apartment, screaming) i love my new job!
honey, you are screaming.
you bet your ass i am! i just had the best first day ever! the kitchen: twice as big as allessandro's.
(yawning) oh, that is great.
yeah, a-a-and clean. not just health department clean... monica clean.
(clearly not so interested) awesome.
oh, and the people are so nice. there is this one guy, geoffrey, he is the maitre d., chandler, you will love him. he is without a doubt, the funniest guy i have ever met. (chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can not believe what he just heard.)
i know! (phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can not open it with one hand, but does not want to let go of mike's hand. she tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)
yeah, i kind of do. (mike let us go of her hand) well, how is this? (she takes mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. after that, they hold hands again. joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)
(in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (phoebe and mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) have you not talked about it yet? (they say nothing now, but smile) am i making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to mike) if you were bigger you would hit me, huh...? aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)
I am sorry... I am sorry. it is obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
(in a flash she answers) maybe not, is it?
(impatient) i know mike, why do not you keep digging?
oh, it is a key. to be honest, i think I would prefer the five dollars.
(really surprised) oh wow, ooh! ooh, big step for phoebe and mike.
oh no, i want to.
yeah... ooh... wow... even started to think I would never meet someone that, you know, i wanted to... do this with. here you go. (both phoebe and mike look really proud.)
it really is.
(sitting at his table) oh, i know it... it is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)
so i do not go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that emma could get a chance to know her.
that is great, great. so do you have any questions for us?
allright. well thank you so much for coming... (they are standing up and make their way to the door)
thank you.
really nice to meet you... and we will call you.
boy, we uhm... had not really thought of that.
okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while ross crumples up the application form) wow! we are never going to find a nanny.
oh, come on rach, we will. i promise. we have more interviews (they sit down and rachel sighs) and worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
(indignant) what, the blonde with no bra?
she was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... there is knocking at the door.) just a sec.! okay, okay. this one's name is sandy. she is got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
okay... (ross opens the door.)
and she is a little mannish...
(gasps) oh my god! david!
(excited) no! it is a great time, come in...! wow, hi... oh my gosh! what are you doing here? are you back from minsk?
who cares, it got you here.
wow. where is your luggage? (david thinks for a while)
a-allright, well... I will call the cab company.
thank you! god, no! you should see me when... oh actually, no, i look pretty good.
no...
I am... I am just... I am the worst person ever. how can i not tell david that I am seeing mike?
maybe he did not give you a chance.
he said: are you seeing someone? and i said no...
oh, well... that had been your window.
yeah! i mean, i do not know. i was just , i was looking, i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking: oh my god! it is david. david's here. he is just, he is so irresistible.
really? the scientist guy?
really? chandler?
continue...
oh.okay, then it gets worse, because then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night.
phoebe!
i know! (points at herself) evil! and... and... and... i like mike so much, you know. it is just going really well. oh my god!
wow, is not it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys?
(sarcastically) uhuh... yeah...!, you know. and given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy i am.
what are you going to do?
i mean i guess, i just have to... tell david that nothing can happen between us. unless i do not... you know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...
you have to tell david!
okay, i knew i should have had this conversation with joey.
(angry) funniest guy she is ever met! (to the door) I am funny, right...? what do you know, you are a door... you just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) save it for inside! (he enters)
heeeeeey!
hey!
hey!
so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner state. frankly I would sooner be in any other state. (monica looks at phoebe, who also does not know what to say.) and what is with oklahoma having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, I am from the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
(does not believe what she is hearing) was your cabin pressurised?
(laughs, but then moves to phoebe) and do not get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk.
okay. (and she walks away)
what is with the word you all? you know, just... two words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so, i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, I will have the fricken? (monica laughs) see, that is... that is funny with the fricken, right?
no, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. i told you about that funny guy, geoffrey, right?
yeah, he came up...
well, he did this bit... you probably had to be there, but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (phoebe bursts out in a laugh)
(to phoebe) were you there?
no, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
sandy, that is exactly what it is...
are you gay? (rachel turns to ross in an embarrassed way)
ross!
oh!
oh, that is pretty.
(skeptic) so you are just like a... guy who is a nanny?
(on a yeah, right tone) okay.
yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (in the other room emma starts to cry.)
oh god, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
oh, that would be great! (sandy leaves for emma's room) i love him, i love him, i love him...
oh, come on, rach, he is a guy!
so wh..? he is smart, he is qualified. give me one good reason we should not try him out.
because, it is weird!
why?
what kind of job is that for a man? a nanny? i-it is like if a woman wanted to be...
(she is got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) yes?
king?
(whispering and begging) please? (ross makes a "whatever" gesture) yes! sandy you are hired.
oooh... ***i really can not hear what she says*** come here.
you got to be at least bi...
hey! (joey does not look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. chandler waits for joey to finish.) i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks.
ooh. i-i do not know chan. I am not so good with remembering lines.
(can not believe what he hears) well, thank god your livelihood does not depend on it.
i know, right? (chandler has really big eyes, and nods) wh... wh... why are we doing this?
monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy she is ever met.
seriously? she actually said that?
yes! am i crazy to be this upset?
nooooo! being funny is your thing!
yeah!
without that, you just got "lame with women".
ye.... (stops because he realises what joey just said, and stares at him. at this moment monica enters)
hi! there you are.
(sees monica) fire trucks! (chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to monica who does not understand what is happening. then he turns back to joey, who says "you are welcome" without a sound)
oof...
oh, wait, wait!
no, no, it is not that. (they go sit on the couch) uhm... remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no? well, uhm... i am. his ... his name is mike.
yeah, i should have told you.
I am sorry, I am sorry.
i am happy.
well... but david, just... i just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.
of course, yeah.(they hug and phoebe sighs... a little after that also david sighs and makes his way to the door) you know, a kiss on the cheek would not be totally inappropriate...
i mean... (david kisses phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)
yeah?
well, if that is what they do in minsk... (they kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... david turns to the door) in new york... it is... (and then david grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... they kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)
(in a tearful voice) oh... oh boy... (she turns around and sees ross) hi...
(very worried) is everything allright?
oh yeah, it is fine, it is fine. sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
i can not... i can not hear it again.
and I am fine never having heard it... (rachel looks at ross in a "why do you say that" manner) rach, can i... can i see you for a sec?
yeah! (to sandy) excuse me... (she walks to the kitchen with ross and sighs)
do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? huh? i have not cried that many times since i moved in.
look, ross, he is just... sandy is just sensitive, that is all.
(picks up a cookie) okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. he is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)
what...? too sensitive to take care of our baby?
(speaking with his mouth full) yeah, i mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) these are amazing!
sandy made madeleines.
this... this is exactly what I am talking about. what kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate french cookies, huh? they are not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)
well, i... you know, i-i-i do not know what to say... i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. you know, because i got to tell you ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
hey... there is sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
okay, what? what is too sensitive? (there is music coming from the living room. ross opens the door to the living room and he and rachel see sandy play a song for emma on his recorder. rachel is moved by this, but ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. the door he was holding, swings back and hits rachel.)
hmmm... no, no... no, i can not do this. it is bad.
no, no. no.
look david, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we would probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and i-I am with mike and i really care about him...
(points to david) and you thanks for the face massage. thank you.
did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
yeah! i think that is great!
oh really? did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes madeleines?
oh... how are they?
(looks like in heaven) lighter than air... (changes back to serious) but that is not the point. (joey now also enters)
hey!
hey...! rachel and i hired a male nanny.
(looks surprised) really...? guys do that...? that is... weird...
thank you!
that is like a woman wanting to be a...
...a what? a what? what is the end of that sentence?
yes... what is the end of that sentence?
uhm... a penis model. (monica can not believe what is she is hearing and ross pats joey on the back.) anyway, hey... did you tell chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you have ever met?
yeah, so?
wow!
really? do you not know chandler?
is that why he is acting so weird...? he is jealous...? oh my god, that is crazy. it is not like I am attracted to geoffrey...
so what? being funny is chandler's thing... you know, like ross's thing is... (he can not come up with anything)
science...? academia...? being a good father...?
...no... (he just can not seem to grasp it)
i can not believe he is that upset about this...
monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. because he is feeling like... (the door opens and chandler walks in with a pizza)
hey!
heeeyy! hey!
what are you guys talking about?
uhm... rachel and i hired a male nanny. (joey makes a gesture and sound like "can you believe that?")
you got a man who is a nanny...? you got a manny...? (monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. joey realises they also should laugh and punches ross. now all three of them laugh, but very fake. chandler seems happy again.)
you know, i do not mind a... male nanny, but i do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)
ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
if I would known you guys were coming over, i would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)
okay, okay... chandler you... you stop it! (monica wipes away tears)
what is so funny about that? (they realise it was not a joke)
well, i do not know... i-it is... just the way you say it... i mean, you are funny... you have that funny thing. you are a funny guy! (chandler turns to joey)
did you tell her what we talked about? (joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)
yeah....
so those were pity laughs? pity laughs? (joey and ross walk away from the kitchen)
honey, listen... you have nothing to worry about with geoffrey.
oh yeah? is he funnier than me?
well, you are... you are different funny... i mean, you are... you are more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
honey, you know i think you are hilarious! come on, you know that joke you told me last week? the one about jerry lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) that slayed me.
hey... i made up that joke and told it to you! (he points at chandler. joey gestures to ross "what are you doing?)
not knowing when to shut up...
yep! that is my thing...
no, no, no, no, no... it is not... it is not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. i was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
no, uhm... david and i did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in minsk. he is only... he is only in town for a couple of days.
no, no...
oh, well, yeah...
stop it! stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and phoebe gets david's jacket and gives it to him) here david, you should just go.
okay, well... guys?
I am sorry, I am so sorry. if you... if you want your key back, i totally understand.
right! never! never! i swear! (they kiss... the door opens and david comes in again.)
yeah! allright! hey, hey ross. check it out! sandy taught me hot-cross buns.
really? sounded like three blind mice.
noooo... three blind mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)
(looks angrily at joey and points at him) i swear to god...! (joey is in shock)
me! I am up for puppets!
okay, okay... how exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
i want to be mr. wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to ross)
(shakes his head) oh my god!
that was kind of rude!
oh, I am sorry. please apologise to sandy and the snufflebumps for me.
you know, he was just doing his job...
well, you know what... i-I am sorry I am the only one who is not in love with gary poppins out there... but i just... i can not... i can not go through with this.
oh, come on ross...
no! hey, you know what? I am sorry. i would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
(sighs) oh... that is true.
thank you!
well, you are the one who wants to fire him, so you are going to have to do it. (ross walks to the living room determined to fire sandy)
(kind of emotional) i am learning so much from you.
well, I am off to tulsa, so if your maitre d. friend has any funny oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
honey, you can relax. last night at work, geoffrey told this really sexist joke. after that, not so funny anymore.
really...? see... that is the thing: you got to keep it smart, people!
okay, do not miss that flight. you know i love you.
i love you too. (monica and chandler kiss. he turns to joey.) and... i like you as a friend. (they hug and pat each other on the back.)
allright. see you later!
see ya! (he leaves the apartment)
(to monica) did that guy really make that joke?
naaaa... he still kills me. last night he had me laughing so hard, i swear... a little pee came out.
here goes...
i can not watch. it is like firing elmo. (ross walks to the couch where sandy sits)
sandy... hi, we uhm... we kind of need to talk. I am afraid it is not working out.
yeah, uhm... i mean, rachel and i, think you are great... with emma... uhm... we just feel...
(from behind the bedroom door) you! you feel!
i... just feel that the... the chemistry is not right. I am sorry. we are... we are more than happy to give you good recommendation...
(from bedroom) oh, damn you geller!
anyway, uhm...well, I am glad there is no hard feelings.
no, you know, it is uhm... nothing you did, it is... it is uhm... my issue.
you know, I am just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who is as sensitive as you.
why... i... i do not know. (sandy tilts his head again) uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
i mean, uhm... you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... you know a-a-and as a kid i was not the athlete i am now.
(from the bedroom) huh ha ha!
i play squash...! anyway, uhm... i uhm... i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive.
it was hard... i remember... i was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "what are you doing with those things? what is wrong with you, why are not you... why are not you outside playing like a... like a real boy?
i know i am! (ross now starts to cry) ...and when it is summer, and it is hot, why can not you wear a tank top?
here come some more...
wow! you blow my mind...
aaahh... how much do i owe you?
it is like the cheapest college ever.
would you let it go? it is not that big a deal.
not that big a deal? it is amazing. ok, you just reach in there, there is one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. all right, as far as I am concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. am i right?
come on! you guys can pee standing up.
we can? all right, I am tryin' that.
ok, you know what blows my mind? women can see breasts any time they want. you just look down and there they are. how you get any work done is beyond me.
oh, ok, you know what i do not get? the way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
multiple orgasms!
so, saturday night, the big night, date night, saturday night, sat-ur-day night!
no plans, huh?
not a one.
not even, say, breaking up with janice?
oh, right, right, shut up.
chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just got to do it.
no, i know, but it is just so hard, you know? i mean, you are sitting there with her, she has no idea what is happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there is the horrible awkward moment when you have handed her the note.
why do you have to break up with her? be a man, just stop calling.
you know, if you want, I will do it with you.
oh, thanks, but i think she would feel like we are gangin' up on her.
no, i mean you break up with janice and I will break up with tony.
tony?
oh, you are breaking up with tony?
yeah, i know, he is sweet, but it is just not fun anymore, you know? i do not know if it is me, or his hunger strike, or, i do not know.
(waitressing) does anybody want anything else?
oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (rachel gives him a dirty look) nothing, just, just, I am fine.
(to rachel) what is the matter? why so scrunchy?
it is my father. he wants to give me a mercedes convertible.
that guy, he burns me up.
yeah, well, it is a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady.
ooh, i hate when my father calls me that.
did he give you that whole "you are-not-up-to-this" thing again?
oh, yeah, yeah. actually, i got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "you will never make it on your own".
(rhythmically) uh-huh, uh-huh.
my god, angela.
wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
are you going to go over there?
no, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. i do not want to seem too eager. one mississippi, two mississippi, three mississippi. that seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) hey, angela.
you look good.
you do not say.
so, uh, rachel, what are you, uh, what are you doing tonight?
oh, big glamour night. me and monica at laundorama.
oh, you uh, you want to hear a freaky coincidence? guess who is doing laundry there too?
who?
me. was that not clear? hey, why do not, um, why do not i just join you both, here?
do not you have a laundry room in your building?
yes, i do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there is a.... rat problem. apparently they are attracted to the dryer sheets, and they are going in fine, but they are comin' out all.... fluffy. anyway, say, sevenish?
sure.
bob? who the hell's bob?
come on, we were great together. and not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
what?
fine, fine, so, why do not the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? you know, as friends?
you know, you and bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, monica.
monica, I am tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
forget it. not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
come on. this guy's great. his name's bob. he is angela's... brother. he is smart, he is sophisticated, and he has a real job. me, i go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but bob is...
(looking out window) oh, god help us.
what?
ugly naked guy's laying kitchen tile. eww!
eww! look, I am asking a favor here. if i do this for her brother, maybe angela will come back to me.
what is going on here? you go out with tons of girls.
(proud) i know, but, i made a huge mistake. i never should have broken up with her. will you help me? please?
(on phone) ok, bye. (hangs up) well, monica's not coming, it is just going to be me and rachel.
oh. well, hold on camper, are you sure you have thought this thing through?
it is laundry. the thinking through is minimal.
it is just you and rachel, just the two of you? this is a date. you are going on a date.
nuh-uh.
yuh-huh.
so what are you saying here? i should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
well, you may want to rethink the dirty underwear. this is basically the first time she is going to see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
(sheepish) no.
oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles? what, it says I am a sensitive, warm kind of guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. ok, i can pick something else up on the way.
there you go.
thank you. so what does this bob guy look like? is he tall? short?
yep.
which?
which what?
you have never met bob, have you?
no, but he is...
oh my god, joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
...horribly attractive. I will be shutting up now.
where are they? where are they?
this is nice. we never do anything just the two of us.
it is great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
eww, i do not want to do that.
here we go.
ok, have a good break-up.
hey, janice.
hey, that is not good. can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
what?
(covering) what... did you get me there?
bullwinkle socks. that is so sweet.
that is great.
well, I am going to get another espresso. can i get you another latte?
that is it?
yeah, it was really hard.
oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
ok, you were not there.
oh, 'scuse me. i was kind of using that machine.
but i saved it. i put my basket on top.
what?
what is going on?
hi, uh, nothing. that horrible woman just took my machine.
was your basket on top?
yeah, but, there were no suds.
so?
well, you know, no suds, no save.
no suds? excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) that is my friend's machine.
hey, hey, hey, that is not the rule and you know it.
(to the crowd in the laundromat) all right, show's over. nothing to see here. (to rachel) ok, let us do laundry.
that was amazing. i can not even send back soup.
well, that is because you are such a sweet, gentle, uh...do you, uh, do you...oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
what is that?
uberveiss. it is new, it is german, it is extra-tough.
rach, do you uh, are you going to separate those?
oh god. oh, am i being like a total laundry spaz? i mean, am i supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
rach, have you never done this before?
well, not myself, but i know other people that have. ok, you caught me. I am a laundry virgin.
uh, well, do not worry, I will use the gentle cycle. ok, um, basically you want to use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
(holds a pair of panties in front of ross) ok, well, what about these are white cotton panties. would they go with whites or delicates?
(visibly nervous) uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
(to joey) he is so cute. (to angela and bob) so, where did you guys grow up?
how, how did that happen?
oh my god.
what?
i suddenly had the feeling that i was falling. but I am not.
so, you and angela, huh?
you are a lucky man. you know what i miss the most about her? that cute nibbly noise when she eats. like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
yeah, but it is not going to last. she is too much for me in bed. sexually.
I have got to tell you, bob is terrific.
it is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
wow. my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
ok, you can do this. it is just like pulling off a band-aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
janice. hi, janice. ok, here we go. i do not think we should go out anymore. janice.
ok, i know this is going to sound really stupid, but i feel that if i can do this, you know, if i can actually do my own laundry, there is not anything i can not do.
that does not sound stupid to me. you know, it is like the first time i had to make dinner for myself, after carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I am sorry, that is all the time we have. next on ross...(opens up the washer) uh-oh.
what uh-oh?
(not wanting to tell her) uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. it is, uh, it is a song. the laundry song that we sing. (singing) uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
ross, what is the matter?
nothing, nothing. lee-lo, the laundry's done.
come on, show me.
all right, all right, it is just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kind of pink.
oh, everything's pink.
yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I am sorry, please do not be upset, it could happen to anyone.
except it did not. it happened to me. oh, god, I am going to look like a big marshmallow peep. what am i doing? what am i doing? my father's right. i can not live on my own! i can not even do laundry!
something went wrong with underdog, and they could not get his head to inflate. so anyway, um, his head is like flopping down broadway, right, and I am just thinking... how inappropriate this is. um, I have got something in my eye, uh, joey, could we check it in the light, please?
oh my god.
what?
hello! were we at the same table? it is like... cocktails in appalachia.
come on, they are close.
close? she is got her tongue in his ear.
oh, like you have never gotten a little rambunctious with ross.
joey, this is sick, it is disgusting, it is, it is—not really true, is it?
well, who is to say what is true? i mean...
oh my god, what were you thinking?
all right, look, I am not proud of this, ok? well, maybe i am a little.
(hits him lightly) oh!
ow!
(leaving) I am outta here.
wait, wait, wait. you want him, i want her. he likes you.
really?
yeah. I am thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
I am so sorry, i can not believe i did this, but i could not stop laughing at your norman mailer story.
uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
here is the thing, janice. you know, i mean, it is like we are different. I am like the bing, bing, bing. you are like the boom, boom, (chandler flails his hand out and hits janice in the eye)... boom.
oh, my god, I am so sorry. are you ok?
(to phoebe) i hit her in the eye! i hit her in the eye! this is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
oh my god. (chandler downs another espresso.) how many of those have you had?
oh, i do not know, a million?
chandler, easy, easy. go to your happy place. la la la la la la la.
I am fine.
all right.
I am not fine. here she comes.
wait here. breathe.
how do you do that?
it is like a gift.
we should always always break up together.
oh, I would like that.
you got the clothes clean. now that is the important part.
oh, i guess. except everything looks like jammies now.
whoa, I am sorry. excuse me. we had this cart.
I am sorry, you know, maybe i was not being clear. uh, this is our cart.
hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
all right, listen, missy. if you want this cart, you are going to have to take me with it!
(to ross) yes! did you see that?
you were incredible! brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
i could not have done this without you.
ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I am fine, I am fine.
are you sure?
no.
oh, are you sure you are ok?
yeah.
does it still hurt?
yeah.
(seeing rachel's clothes) what a neat idea. all your clothes match. I am going to do this.
hi.
hey, how did it go?
excellent.
we ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
what a beautiful story. hey, I am fine by the way.
(notices his head) oh, I am sorry.
where is chandler?
oh, he needed some time to grieve.
I am free! I am free!
that oughta do it.
(to clerk) hi.
six? i just had it for one night. it is three.
y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. look, you are going to have to help me out here, ‘because i only have three.
oh my god. richard? (turns around) hi!
wow! your lip went bald. (richard pays the clerk) hey, thanks.
right.
what?
(removes them) that is because i-i was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it is static cling. or maybe it is just that god knew I would be running into you and saw an opportunity.
it is good to see you too.
you see that guy? he is in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he is going straight to the porn.
yeah.
me too.
oh, um, i do not know if that is a good idea.
no, i just i think that it is too soon.
yeah, baby!
what are you doing?
making chocolate milk. do you want some?
no thanks. I am 29.
(looking at her watch) oh my god, i got to go to work!
oh sweetie, when do you think you are going to get off tonight?
oh i do not know honey. it is going to be really late.
oh come on, not again.
i know. I am sorry. look, I will make a deal with you all right? okay?
hmm.
for every night that you are asleep before i get home from work...
yeah.
i will wake you up in a way that is proved very popular in the past.
now, if you need to stay late, i want to be supportive of that.
right.
(entering, holding a pair of roller blades) hi.
(to phoebe) look at you. since when do you roller blade?
oh! since tomorrow. i met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that is he is going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
and what are you going to do for him?
I am going to let him.
okay.
cool.
(entering from her bedroom) morning.
somebody got in late last night.
yeah well, i ran into richard.
when did this happen?
oh, um, around 8:02. we ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
oh, there is no such thing as an innocent burger.
so, are you going to see him again?
tomorrow night.
monica, what are you doing?
well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she is celebrating that by going on a date with him.
it is not a date, okay. I am just going to teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
well, you might want to make a little extra, y'know you will probably be hungry after the sex.
we are not going to have sex! okay, nothing’s changed here. he still does not want children and i still do, so that is why we are just going to be friends.
naked friends.
(entering) hey.
hey.
do you have any ice?
check the freezer. if there is none in there, then we are probably out. are you just getting in from work? it is late.
yeah, i know. i had the greatest day though, i got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from calvin klien. i told my boss i liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. how was your day?
i discovered I am able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
hmm. (she opens the freezer) umm, why do you have a copy of the shining in your freezer?
oh, i was reading it last night, and i got scared, so.
but ah, you are safe from it if it is in the freezer?
well, safer. y'know, i mean i never start reading the shining, without making sure we have got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
how often do you read it?
have not you ever read the same book over and over again?
well, umm, i guess i read little women more than once. but i mean that is a classic, what is so great about the shining?
the question should be rach, what is not so great about the shining. okay? and the answer would be: nothing. all right? this is like the scariest book ever. i bet it is way better than that classic of yours.
okay. ah, well we will just see about that, okay. i will read the shining, (she tries to take the book away from him but he does not want to let it go) and you will read little women.
all right, you got it.
all right.
okay.
okay.
ah, now rach, these ah, these little women.
yeah.
how little are they? i mean, are they like scary little?
um, chandler, ross, this is robert.
oh, hey.
hey.
(to robert) you have have lipstick right here (points to her cheek). that is okay, it is mine, we just kissed.
oh.
(to robert) so ah, is not a bit cold out for shorts?
right, right. sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
(standing up) I am up! I am up, I have gotten up now! anybody ah, want anything?
I will have coffee.
yeah, make that three.
okay ross, why do not you come with me?
okay. (goes over to the counter) (to chandler) what ah, what is the matter with you? what is going on?
robert’s coming out.
what, what do you mean, what? is he gay?
no. he.....he is coming out of his shorts.
what?!
the man is showing brain.
are you sure? (chandler nods: yes!) hold on. (walks over behind the couch) I am sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
okay.
no, no, that will not be ah, that will not be necessary (leans down and looks up robert’s shorts, seeing robert’s package.)
(to ross) wellll?
yeah, yeah, yeah!
what do we do? what do we do?
well, i suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
like an eclipse.
you say ‘thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. come on, we are going to put are hands in this bowl, and we are going to start squishing the tomatoes.
you touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
oops.
got to keep squishing.
okay.
oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it (does so) and it should umm, be.....
umm, you have got some on your pants.
these little women. wow!
your liking it, huh?
oh yeah! amy just burned jo’s manuscript. i do not see how he could ever forgive her.
umm, jo’s a girl, it is short for josephine.
but jo’s got a crush on laurie. (ross nods his head) oh. you mean it is like a girl-girl thing? ‘because that is the one thing missing from the shining.
no, actually laurie’s a boy.
no wonder rachel had to read this so many times.
hey!
hey.
hey! how did the ah, basketball go?
oh, okay, i learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
you mean a three pointer?
oh, i get more because I am dainty.
yeah, in the back. you want a quarter?
(noticing chandler) what are you doing? (he pushes chandler back to his side of the couch) get back over on your side of the... (sees robert in all his glory) hello!! (to robert) hi, I am joey, we have not met.
what? (the guys keep laughing.) what? you guys, what is going on? you not like robert? (the guys keep laughing.) why are you laughing?!
calm down. there is no reason to get testy.
you guys!! come on!
I am sorry, I am sorry, it just seems that robert is not as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
what do you mean?
hey.
hey robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?
so, how did the lasagne go over? (listens) really?! good. so you owe me three pretty things. (listens) yeah, I have been thinking a lot about you too. (listens) i know. it is hard this whole platonic thing. (listens) it is a word!
yeah, i do think it is better this way. (listens) yeah, we are being smart. (gets up to answer the door) (listens) yes, I am sure.(she opens the door and it is richard)
I will call you back. (starts kissing him)
so we can be friends who sleep together.
sounds smart and healthy to me. so um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
oh.
no! (pushes him) no!
‘because if you do that means you would be cancelling it for me, and we are just friends.
hey. ooh! do not sit down!
yeah. and, first here is a gift.
stretchy pants! why, those are the greatest things in the world! if i were you i would wear them every day, every day!
that is all right, that is well, i figured.... (they start to leave as joey enters.)
hey! (starts to laugh.) how is it going?
good.
hey, rach, how you doing with the shining?
oh, danny just went into room 217.
oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you are going to ruin it!
all right I will talk in code. (to ross and chandler) remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
hmmm, that is very cool.
oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. oh no-no-no, no, the end when jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. aww!
joey! i can not believe you just did that!
i can not believe she cracked your code!
all right, okay, laurie proposes to jo, and she says no, even though she is still in love with him, and then he ends up marring amy.
hey! mine was by accident! all right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
eh. beth dies.
beth, beth dies?
um-hmm.
is that true? if i keep reading is beth going to die?
no, beth does not die, she does not die. does she rachel?
what?!
joey’s asking if you have just ruined the first book he is ever loved that did not star jack nicholson?
no. she does not die.
then why would you say that?!
because, i wanted to hurt you.
(gasps) oh my....
hi.
(screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) sorry. I am sorry.
you would not believe my day! i had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, i lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.
what are you smiling at?
I am sorry, i was just thinking you are day could still pick up.
yeah, right.
i love this friend thing!
listen, robert’s going to be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?
oh.
please, right now, no, every time i see him it is like ‘is it on the lose?’ ‘is it watching me?’
we can not tell him, you can not go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
he is right, even if it is to say something complementary. (he stops and thinks about what he just said.)
hey.
no, i can spot you from here.
okay, listen robert...
(to chandler) hey, do not we have to...
yeah, we got, um-hmm.
umm, i think you are really, really great...
i-i-i-i-i do not know, i do not know what to say.
ow!
oh my god! oh my god! (she frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as richard starts the tour.)
(still hiding under the blankets) so um, who was she?
(still hiding under the blankets) did you like her? and I am just asking as a friend, because i am totally fine with this.
(gets up) okay, y'know what, I am not fine, I am not. i mean how can i be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) y'know what, what if we are friends who do not see other people?
why not?! i mean this has been the most amazing week. would it be so terrible? even if we were friends who lived together. or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.
that is not true, you do not have a moustache.
y'know what, I have got to walk out of here right now, ‘because getting over you is the hardest thing that i have ever had to do. i do not think i could do it again.
how ‘bout one last game of racquetball?
watch the thorns!
what?
beth is really, really sick.
awwww.
jo’s there, but i do not think there is anything she could do.
joey?
yeah.
do you want to put the book in the freezer?
(nodding his head) okay.
okay.
happy birthday!!!
happy birthday!!!
it is your birthday!
(to monica) she is not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
they do!
rachel! come on out! monica made breakfast!
chocolate-chip pancakes!
we have got presents!
good ones?
they all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
well, can i keep the presents and still be 29?
come on rach! look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
oh really. is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
(screaming) why god?!! why?!! we had a deal!! let the others grow old! not me!! (he buries his head in phoebe’s lap for comfort.)
y’know, I am still 29 in guam.
hey, 30 is not that old! do you know how old the earth is?
late thirties? oh come on you guys! is it just me? am i overreacting to this?
no rach, it is not just you. my thirtieth birthday certainly was not that much fun.
(screaming) and now chandler! we are all gettin’ so old! (looking up) why are you doing this to us?! (turns away crying.)
rach, you are in a great place in your life. come on, you have got a great job! good friends…
yeah, you are roommate is a soap opera star.
look, y’know i know my life’s going pretty well, but i look around and i just see so many people who have accomplished so many other goals by the time they are thirty.
yeah, but you should not compare yourself to me.
there you go!
i did it! one mile on a hippity-hop! that is it!! that is everything i wanted to do before i was thirty. oh, except i wanted to patch things up with my sister. but oh well. yay!! (they all cheer again.) and-and girls this thing is a godsend if you know what i mean. (rachel and monica look intrigued and as they all head into central perk, rachel picks up the hippity-hop that phoebe left behind.)
thirty. ugh, i mean thirty! monica, do you remember mean, old mrs. kreeger in the fifth grade? she was thirty!
nothing. i do not want to do anything.
well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like ross.
hey! that was a practical purchase! i needed that car for transportation! okay? i-i have a child!
how hot do i look in this, huh?!
ross, a sports car? would not it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
that is not what this is about okay? i-i am a sports car enthusiast. i have always been into cars.
hey, what is the horsepower on this thing?
(giddy) i do not know, but-but look how shiny!
i can not believe you bought this.
really! god ross, what were you thinking? (to phoebe, quietly) i know it is really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
oh, well get in line missy. (to ross) so, can i have a ride stud?
hop in. (phoebe hops in.) get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
damnit! (shuts the car off.)
(getting out) okay, who is next?
y’know what? i am going to do something today. I am not just going to sit around like some old lady. I am going to get something pierced. like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.
really?! ‘because y’know that hurts.
so what?! y’know what? the way i see it—(phoebe pulls out a hair from the back of her head)—ow! son of a bitch!!
(glares at him) get out, get out of my apartment.
all right rach, for what it is worth, i think that you are doing great. i mean y’know let us face it, no one handles this well.
least of all you.
were not you asked to leave sonny?
(to joey) would you put that back on?! monica’s going to be here any minute!
but it hurt’s my joey’s apple.
(frustrated) okay, for the last time. it is not named for each individual man.
oh well, not as lovely as you. i mean, i can not believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (to mr. geller) and you! i can not believe that you would have a tux that is thirty years old! (puts his hand on mr. geller’s shoulder.)
ohh! (he quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
(entering) hey! everybody hide! hide! i saw her! she is coming!
okay! okay! everybody down! everybody down! (rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. as everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
(getting up to investigate) okay, everybody stay here. i will find out what is going on.
heyyy!! you got the door open!! (giggles.)
hey-hey are you drunk?
nooo! (giggles) okay. (she tries to pull herself up by rachel and joey’s doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. she manages to catch herself.) whoa! (stands up, unsteadily) okay. see i was, i was a little nervous about turning (whispering) thirty. (giggles.) so the bus boys took me out for some drinks. (pause) i want to puke on you later!
okay, here is the thing. we have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! all of your friends are in there and your parents!
noo!!!
yes!
noo!!
yes!!
oh no! my parents have never seen me drunk! (pause) that they know of.
okay, here is the thing. we are going to get you some coffee and they will never know that you are drunk.
really?! you promise?
yeah, I will take care of it.
okay. i love you so much. (kisses him.)
(laughing) okay we have to do something about your breath.
what about your breath?! (breathes on him.)
that is still yours. okay, now remember it is a surprise party. so, when you go in, act surprised.
okay. i can do that.
okay.
okay, forward. forward—stop! (the car moves an inch and ross runs to the back of the car.) okay, back—stop! (the car barely moves and ross runs back to the front.) okay, forward—stop! stop! stop!
ross, just forget about it. this guy’s got you totally wedged in.
well actually…
no-no-no! it is mine! it is-it is mine. (the woman walks away.)
dude, you soooo need this car.
(running up) okay. okay, here is what we are going to do. okay, I am going to break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. you guys push it forward so ross can drive out of his spot. okay? all right, here we go. (she opens her coat and reveals that thing car thieves use to break into cars as ross jumps in behind the wheel. she inserts the device, unlocks the door, opens it, and the alarm goes off.) haul ass!!!! (runs off.)
happy thirtieth birthday! here! (hands her the hippity-hop.) it is for the child in you, and the woman. happy thirtieth!
because it is our thirtieth birthday.
wait! (knocks on the door and ursula opens it.)
yeah. what?!
nu-uh!
you have your birth certificate?
our mom.
do you have my birth certificate?
(reading the certificate) oh my god! oh my god, we are 31.
i just lost a whole year of my life.
your middle name is pamela?
well, i never knew mine. do you remember what it is?
that is my first name.
okay before we start the celebration, monica has to go put on her party dress.
yay!
see? (does his laugh.) here we go. (starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of mr. geller who is sitting at the table and mrs. geller who is standing next to him.)
(sees someone) paul!
(correcting her) phil.
phil!
now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (monica stumbles on the steps.) okay, (catches her) you are doing great. you are doing great. you are doing fine.
hey, what is going on?
monica’s a little drunk.
yay! i love drunk monica!
awwwww… (giggles.)
(to monica) go change! (to phoebe) she does not want her parents to know she is drunk.
ohh! all right! all right. here is what we will do, I will get twice as drunk as monica and then no one’s will even notice her.
what is-what is going on? phil’s really pissed!
monica’s wasted.
maybe that will liven up this party.
(to rachel) okay, will you just go help her change please!
okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for joey.
yep. (starts for monica’s room, but chandler stops him.)
ahh!
(opening it) a scooter! (she is not happy.)
(to tag) stick to the list. always stick to the list.
no! no-no, i love it. thank you. (kisses him.)
okay, open ours next. open ours next!
okay.
now that you are a couple, we do not get two presents from you guys?
for my last birthday you gave me a hug! (to rachel) okay, read the card! read the card!
okay. (opens the card and reads it.) happy birthday grandma! it is better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (breaks down as everyone glares at them.) all our love monica and chandler. (crying) that is funny, yeah!
no-no-no-no! that was the joke!
(crying) no, i know! i get it! it is funny!
no, because you are not a grandmother!
no i know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i do not have any of those things. that is why it is so funny. (runs into her room crying.)
all you had to do was buy the card!
hey! look who is back! it is the birthday girl! how is the birthday girl feeling?
well, i feel fine, but i think you are bumming out the rest of the kids.
what? (glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)
okay! y’know what? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. all i really needed was a plan. see i want to have three kids…
oh let me guess, and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother.
as i was saying… i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I am 35 which gives me five years. i love this plan! i want to marry this plan!
if you could do that, I would marry the hippity-hop.
so, if i want to have my kid when I am 35, i do not have to get pregnant until I am 34. which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes! oh wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant…
really! that long?! (chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (to chandler) look all you want, it is happening!
no, so i do not have to get married until I am 33! that is three years, that is three whole years—oh, wait a minute though. I will need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I would like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… which means i need to meet the guy by the time I am thirty.
which is fine! because you just turned—(removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!
no! ross, no! it is not fine! eh-eh-according to my plan i should already be with the guy i want to marry!
will you quit hoggin’ it!
(to chandler) I am telling you it is like watching bambi learn how to walk.
(to monica) you are drunk! mom and dad are going to be maaaaadd! maybe I am a little drunk.
(to a waiter) oh that is great! right there! can we get some of that over here please? (the waiter comes over) there we go.
(to the waiter) hey! are those crab cakes? (the waiter nods) did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
(to monica) how are you feeling?
you are so handsome! i want to make love to you right here, right now! (growls and pulls him into a kiss.)
i really wish that you would not.
(to monica) now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and do not talk to anyone.
(clinking two glasses together) speech! speech! let us hear from the birthday girl! huh?
pheebs!!
do not you see? everyone is looking at me! the plan’s working! i did not even have to take off my top yet!
come on!
i think it is necessary. (backs away anyhow.)
i-i-i want to thank you all for coming. my family and my friends…
(screaming) wooo!! hoo!!
i really like to say that I am-um… (pause) y’know what I would really like to say? I am drunk!! (mrs. geller pulls the camera down.) that is right mom and dad your little harmonica is hammered!! (ross grabs the camera out of his dad’s hands.) and guess what! I have been drunk before! and I have smoked a cigarette! and i got a box of ding-dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! it is all okay. it is okay because i turned thirty today. and, and i can do anything i want! because i am a grown up. (falls over sideways with ross filming the fall.)
(to joey) okay quick, help me get this off! (motions to her top.)
yeah!!
i lost a whole year! i can not believe it! this is so unfair!
oh, i do not know pheebs. it will be okay.
will it? will it?! i mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
that is not going to happen. no. (looks up) because we have a new deal!
plus, it totally ruined my schedule! i…i have not done any of the things i wanted to do by the time i was 31!
like what?
like okay i-i-i, i have not met any portuguese people! i, i have not had the perfect kiss! and i have not been to sniper’s school!
phoebe, y’know why do not we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
no, i just feel like being by myself for a while. all right? I will see you guys later. thanks. (gets up and exits.)
hey. (after she leaves.) oh, poor pheebs.
hey, y’know what you guys? i think I am going to go walk her home. (gets up and runs out.)
oh man!
what?
he is going to eat the cake!
pheebs! wait up! (she stops.) listen uh, close your eyes. (she does so and joey passionately kisses her.) maybe that is one thing you can cross off your list.
oh yeah.
oh, and plus I am 1/16th portuguese.
oh! (phoebe walks away smiling.)
okay, is everybody clear? we are going to pick it up…and move it. now all we need is teamwork, okay? we are going to lift the car…and slide it out. lift and slide!
ross, i really do not think…
(interrupting her) lift!! and slide!
okay, here we go.
all right everyone, lift! (they and try to lift the car, of course it does not raise up) and slide!! (everyone leans over, but the car still does not move.)
hey joey, can i…
oh, come on rach! my turn just started!
actually, i just want to talk to tag.
oh. okay. hey, can i ride this outside?
whatever! okay, I am not your mother.
okay! (runs off downstairs.)
not in the street!!
yes!
(to tag) hi.
hey.
yeah, I am doing okay. I am um…let us talk.
umm…
ohh tag, umm…you are such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but i do not-i do not…
well said. and a uh good example of the fun i was referring to uhh, but i just think I am past the point where i think i can y’know, just have fun.
yeah, it is! but you are just a kid! i mean you are 25!
oh god! y’know what i wish? i wish you were six years older. well actually, if I am wishin’ for stuff, i actually wish i was six years younger.
yeah, I am sorry. (they hug.)
hey! how did it go?
oh, if i only want two kids, can i keep him for another year?
you did the right thing.
(entering, limping, and holding his arm) i do not like this anymore. (he sits down with them in pain.)
well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
god, do you realize in ten years we are going to be 40?
(crying) why god?! why are you doing this to us?! (he buries his head in ross’s shoulder.)
yes! my baby’s finally free!
all-all right! (they run and jump in the car.) start it up! let us go!
(starting it) woohoo!
you want to buy a car?
no.
hey you guys!
hey!
hey, what are you doing?
that is funny, we were doing the same thing!
yeah!
it is really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i-i had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the numbers.
so what did you two do about it?
it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell.
there is no way around it pheebs, you just going to have to accept the fact that this is going to cost you a lot of money.
yeah, and I am responsible for just like half of that.
but really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
yeah! now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall?
I have got to say you guys, that is an incredible gesture!
(to ross) maybe you do that next time you get married!
no, no, no. the next time it is going to be a hawaii at sunset. [pause] but maybe the time after that!
hey!
hey!
what is going on?
our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
(sarcastically) we?
you know you do not want me to help. you can not have it both ways!
hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
kind of. she is coming by to interview us and see where we live.
and it has to go perfectly, because if she does not like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap opera fan! it is very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
(pointing at himself) little people?
(pointing at himself) celebrity.
ok, so i think I am just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
what...? no!
chandler?
(he stands up and he feels very offended) i do not, and I am offended by the insinuation!
ok, so there is not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the vcr?
I will admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
it is not mine!
(going out with the vcr in his hand) well, i guess we will never know whose it is!
yes. we are here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
well, i think you are going to appreciate it the crap out of this one (she gives him a check)
and we do not want any recognition. this is completely anonymous.
mr. x and phoebe buffay.
buffay is spelled b-you-f-f-a-y.
sure, i so glad we did this. it feels so good!
oh, look! and we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)
mhm... it is moist.
(he enters) hi!
hi! emma will be up in a minute!
oh, good!
oh hey ross... listen, i heard about you and charlie. I am really sorry.
oh, that is ok. I am sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
absolutely.
there was one! she is it! all the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
so, uhm... what are you going to do today?
well, i was thinking of taking emma to the playground!
oh my god, what!?
like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire!
ok, look, ross. i do not want emma going to the playground.
be-caaauuuse...
(upset) all right, well, if you must know... i had a traumatic... swing incident... when i was little.
seriously?
yes, i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. and to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! (crying) and it was uneven for weeks!
(sarcastic) and you made it through that? i wonder who is going to play you in the movie!
ok, fine! you can make fun of me. i do not want emma going there. and i was thinking claire danes.
look, I am sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? but the swings are perfectly safe, and besides emma loves them. you know what, you should come with us and you will see!
ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! ok? when you are... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just do not know if you are going to return back to earth!
space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) look, please, just come on, you know, when you will see the look on emma’s face, i swear you will not regret it.
all right!
good, you do not want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
irrational, huh? all right, well, I will remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
oh, yeah, that is the same, i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
oh my god, the adoption lady is early!
ok, ok, here we go.
ok.
here we go. stand up straight. (smiling) big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
hello, is this the creepy residence?
we are waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I am glad you are here. i was cleaning this morning and i found this (she puts a box on the table and opens it). i do not know if you want to use it, but…
awe, this is so sweet of you! but you know what? i will not be needing a veil, i actually will not be wearing a dress at all!
i told you! i am not coming to a naked wedding!
no, no, no, we are not having a big reception, we took the money we were going to spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
that is crazy! (phoebe looks bewildered). i am sorry. i just can not imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
we, you know, we are different! we do not care about having a huge party. (she picks up the veil) this is really nice for you, but, oh, please, i put this on? (she puts it on) and, ow, i look (she looks her reflex image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) all right, well, who cares, i do not need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
that is right. you are making a commitment and that is the same, whether you do that at the plaza or, where are you going to do it?
city hall.
ow! (chandler slaps her on her back) oh, that sounds nice! i am just there for jury duty. they really spruce that place up!
it is ok, it is ok. i made my decision. what i really want is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)
yay!
but you already gave all your money to charity!
well, I will just ask for it back!
i do not think you can do that!
why not! this is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
that is sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.
ok, careful.
ok.
careful, watch her hair. watch her hair!
rach, she is got like three hairs!
i know (she touches emma’s head) but they are just so beautiful! oh, my god, i just pulled one out.
i promise you she is safe! no watch how much she loves this.
ok.
ok.
here we go! (he starts pushing emma)
ok, careful, ok. (emma giggles) oh, she is smiling! oh my god, she does like it!
see, i told you!
awe! (emma laughs) oh my god! looks, she is a little dare-devil! oh, let me push, can i push?
oh, absolutely!
ok. oh god. (to ross) get the camera, it is in the diaper bag.
ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) see? scared of swings, i bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) ow!
it is for our wedding day! right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us going to have to start flirting.
the donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.
yeah. see, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we did not want, but it turns out we do.
i am sorry. i am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
hey, that is not fair! a person’s wedding is important! and especially to me! ok? i did not have a graduation party! and i did not go to prom. and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. so i deserve a real celebration and i am not going to let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.( she storms out)
hi, i am monica and this is chandler. please come in.
would you like something to drink?
ok. great. i am so glad that you are here. we are really excited about getting this process started.
oh, because we love kids. love ‘them to death.well, not actually to death, that is just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
ah, thank you. this building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
is that that couple on the first floor? because we should get a baby before
but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
what?
really? what is it?
ohh... that would not by any chance be... joey tribbiani?
of course it was!
rat bastard!
(form the other side of the door) hellooo? anybody in there order a celebrity?
oh, it is just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. he is great with
oh, oh ross, oh my god, are you okay?
son of a bitch! (turns to his right to see three kids staring at him) (to the
ross, see! i told you, those swings are evil! alright, that is it. that is
no! no, no, no, no, okay, it was not the swing's fault. it was my fault and kind
ross, c'mon, please. can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets
no wait, okay, okay, i have an idea. i want you to get on the swing, okay? and
(looks at him suspiciously) i know what this is all about... you have always been
look, i just think you are an adult, okay? and you should get over your silly
alright fine. I will do it.
good.
if you hold a spider.
(he freaks out and starts jumping around brushing his sweater) what? where? where?
if you hold a spider.
i know. (rachel bends down to emma and ross looks over his shoulder again,
guys? everything ok? it is me, joe...
(screams to interrupt joey) aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......aaaaaa-doption!!
oh, just like i said. that crazy... bert... roaming the halls. (joey bangs on
guys!?
keep on roaming bert! we do not want any crazy today!
what is going on?
we will talk to you later, bert. everythng's fine!!
everything does not sound fine!
oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother... ernie.
(nervous smile) you can not make this stuff up!
(lightly) oh! it ended okay. one of my friends shot him.
yeah, i really do. you know, i had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few
look, i can not have a wedding with this money now. it is tainted.
and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend has not shot
oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture,
(pulls laura into the spare room) why do not i show you the baby's room?
what the hell are you doing?
well, you would not let me in, so i thought you were in trouble.
well, we are not.
but you called me 'bert'!? that is our code word for danger!
we do not have a code word.
we do not? we really should. from now on, 'bert' will be our code word for danger.
so that was the baby's room. (they come out and chandler throws joey behind
(to chandler) what room should we see next?
any room that is not behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
(laughs nervously as well, laura looks confused) (to laura) some people do not
(quivering with anger) i did not care for that!
(escorting joey to the door) you have to get out of here. you slept with
ok, ok! (he leaves)
ok!
what?
i forgot my bat.
and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! and we do not want to buy your bat! (joey lowers his bat)
(to chandler) bert! bert! bert! bert!
i can explain... joey...
uhm... ok... uhm... well, yeah... you have got some nerve, coming back here. i can not believe you never called me.
oh... yeah... probably you do not even remember my name. it is joey, by the way. and do not bother telling me yours, because i totally remember it... lady. yeah! i waited weeks for you to call me.
no, no! do not try to turn this around on me, ok? I am not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
really? think about it. come on! you are a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? if i had your number, why would not i call you?
no, no, hey, no! too late for apologies... ok? you broke my heart. you know how many women i had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment, leaving her shocked)
(acting sad) no! i waited a long time, i can not wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)
oh, that is really ok.
yeah, that we totally understand. dating is hard.
laura! (and points to her, very confident)
(to the charity guy) we are back!
yeah, because you know what, it is... it is all about the children.
although... it is also about the wedding... ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls it back again) no... oh god... oh!
but... but... but we are giving you this!
(looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) well, this is very generous!
oh, is that you?
hello...? oh hi... oh my god...! really...? i can not wait to tell chandler... ok, goodbye. (hangs up)
wrong number?
it was laura... she gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
that is great!
now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there is a baby waiting for us. oh...
hello...? have you seen joey's bat?
ok... i got a spider. there were two, i picked the bigger one.
(nervously) ok...
ok... (and passes the spider to ross who holds it in between his hands)
(gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) this feels perfectly normal. ok, get on the swing!
(reluctantly) ok... of-k...
(more confident) ok...
whoo... ok... wow... ok... oh!
see?
a-alright! i can do this.
there you go! good for you! and you know what, I am actually getting used to this little guy. i do not really even feel him in here anymore.
that is because he is on your neck.
well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of the spider) whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
ross!
(she enters) hey guys!
honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend.
that place in vermont? you can take a hint!
wait, you can not go away this weekend! it is emma's birthday!
yeah!
we are having a party.
well, can not you just have the party when we get back?
no.
no, that day... that will not be her real birthday!
gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
c'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
well, I am sorry, but chandler and i could really use a weekend away. you know, to reconnect... emotionally.
there is this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim...
well, can not you just go to vermont the next day?
yeah, we want everyone to be there. as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
and i mean, you know, you guys... this is a big deal. i mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
all right, we will stay. we can just drive up after the party.
fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party...
believe me, that is not why we will not be doing that!
you know pheebs, when i was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find  them all.
oooh, i love family traditions like that. when uhm... when ursula and i were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
(he enters) hey guys!
hey, i brought the camera for emma's video.
oh, good, good! we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we will give it to her when she is 18.
oh, cool!! wow, it is like a time capsule!
yeah!
oh, just think... she is going to be watching that video on a tv that has not even been invented yet! with friends who right now are just like babies! and they will be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
that is the hope! so, is emma awake yet?
oh no, it is still nap time. but she will be up soon.
ah, and where is joey?
i said it is still nap time.
(taping joey with the cam) hey, there is uncle joey!
hey!
hey, say something to emma on her 18th birthday!
18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "how you doing" line)
joey, no!
what, what!? it is for her hot friends!
when they see this you will be 52!
and starting to think about settling down!
hey joey, will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on?
I would love to! yeah!
(to phoebe) we were supposed to bring presents?
yeah! i wrote emma a song.
oh, yeah! how was i supposed to know?
joey, it is a birthday party.
yeah, but for a one-year-old. what is the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer. and he is standing next to this cow and the cow says "el-moo"! (joey starts laughing) yeah... that is a funny cup!
hey!
hey hey! where is the birthday girl?
oh, she is still napping
oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
look, i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this is not a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? emma will never have a first birthday again.
all right... you are right. we are sorry. now let us wake up emma and get the fun time started!
no really, she did not sleep well last night, so we can not wake her up.
are you freaking kidding me, green?
(points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) hey!
so glad you came!
(pointing the camcorder at himself) there is something you did not know about your dad!
hey mr. and mrs. geller! let me help you with that.
oh man, this is great, uh? the three of us together again! you know what would be fun? if we gave this present to emma from all of us!
i can not believe emma is still asleep!
i know, what are we going to do?
I have got a plan. I have got a plan. I am going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. you are going to scream out and that will wake her up!
I am not going to vermont with this monica!
hey pheebs, you know what? i was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe i could do something for emma using my talents!
so you are going to... hit on her?
no, no, no! my talents as an actor!
oh!
you know, i could like maybe... i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
or you could stick a fork in an apple!
hey, i think emma might like it!
oh! emma might like what?
um, my present!
what did you get her?
actually we prepared performances.
separate performances.
but equally real!
well, this sounds like fun! well, you know what? actually? people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
sure, yeah!
(unconfidently) of k.
(to everybody) all right, let us get this party started, huh? joey and phoebe are going to perform a little something for us.
oh, great!
(to joey) are you going to be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
hey, i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
so, joey, what are you going to do for us?
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma’s books.
oh, ok, which one?
uh, why, it is a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) “riding the storm out. coping with post-partum depression” eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) “love you forever”. love you forever. by robert munsch. published by firefly books. printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in mexico. a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang “I will love you forever, I will like you for always, as long as I am living, my baby you will be”. (the picture fades and joey is now finishing the book). and while he rocked her, he sang “I will love you forever, I will like you for always, as long as I am living, my baby you will be”.
(crying) wow! that was amazing!
thank you so much for that gift!
amazing... amazing.
oh, phoebe, I am sorry! phoebe has prepared something as well.
that is right, I have prepared a song for emma. from my heart to hers. for there is no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) emma! your name poses a dilemma. because not much else rhymes with emma! maybe the actor richard crenna, he played the commanding officer in rambo. happy birthday emma!
is that it?
no, of course not! i also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). “sex and the single mother. (pause) finding your g-spot.
ross, um, do not forget to get a shot of emma’s cake. it is in a box in the fridge.
sure.
oh, you are going to love this cake. i got it from a bakery in new jersey, corino’s.
oh my god, that place has the creamiest frosting! i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid.
well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they will copy it in icing!
oh, did you do a picture of emma?
yes! on a cake shaped like a bunny.
uh, rach? does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? say for bachelorette parties?
ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! oh my god! they put my baby’s face on a penis!
why you guys this is not funny, all right? if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself!
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). that is a weird sentence!
oh! believe you me! i am going to bring this cake back, i do not even want it in my home... (turns towards the cake and sees joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) joey, do not touch it!!
I am so confused!
(speaking to the person on the phone again) yes, yes. i still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
to be fair this one does have nuts.
hey mon, that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
oh. so nice of her to pull my hair, 'till i dropped the key!
well, you know what? while we are waiting, you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at monica and chandler) ok!
hi emma! it is the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap?
we are aunt monica and uncle chandler, by the way. you may not recognize us, because we have not spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. because of you! happy birthday. (ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)
ross, rachel promised it would be over by now. we seriously have to go, if we want to get to vermont. i called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
and you know, i have a massage client soon.
you guys, just please.. a little bit longer. i promise, rachel will be back with the cake any minute. monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
alright, 5 more minutes.
(into receiver) hello? (listens) oh no! what happened? (listens some more) ok ok, where are you? (grabs a pen and starts writing). ok, I will be right there. (puts the phone down)
was that emma? is she up?
no, rachel got pulled over for speeding. she forgot her licence so now i have to bring it to her.
well, if you are leaving, I am definitely going to go.
no! wait! if anybody gets to go.. it is us (points at herself and chandler) we have been complaining the longest!
no, wait ! you guys, no, no, you can not leave! rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. how do you think she is going to feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
i do not know! you will tell us on monday!
joey! you are in charge, ok? you make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)
got it! (goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) hey hey hey! (to chandler) where do you think you are going?
to the bathroom!
alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we are going to be here for a li...(stops and thinks) wait a minute, there is a window in there!
oh no! he is not getting away that easy! (phoebe and joey run towards the bathroom and enter)
(yelling) what are you doing? get the hell out of here! (phoebe and joey come out looking shocked)
well, that one did not have emma's face on it.
no, it did not.
no.
ok! (opens the door for them)
nighty-night!
bye, bye.
joey? how could you just let them leave?
hey, hey, hey, hey! I am not going to mess with jack, he is a great man, he fought for our country.
no, he did not! he pretended to be a quaker to get out of korea.
(shocked) oh! well that is it! he is the last one to go. I am locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)
you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right?
oh! i forgot you used to live here!
hello?
hey! (smiles)
(smile fades) what audition?
what? you never said anything about an audition!
a monologue? i do not have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") i got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) aah! so... I am going to take off!
wh.. what? no wait, you do not get to leave! I have got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
yeah, and we have paid for a room, that we are supposed to be in right now!
well, oh, ok now... only one of us has to stay with emma. ok, and as the person who realized that, i get to go!
no! no! let us figure out a fair way to decide who is staying.
oh! i got it! ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. alright? whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
(she gives joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) ok, ten.
okay, monica picks ten, i call nine! anyone else?
no, let us just draw straws.
or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
I am begging you stop.
right.
ok, how about this: we got wind up toys for emma for her birthday. we can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
(visibly excited) yeah!! let us do that!
(also very excited) that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in vermont!
everybody get your toys! (they all run toward the table with toys)
ok! i want the dolphin!
that is a bear.
I am too excited!
phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, joey, you get the robot, and chandler and i get the dog. ok, and the race is going to go (takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. now the one who comes in last, stays!
ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)
ok, on your mark... get set... go!!!
go! go!
come on robot!
(to the dog) what are you barking at?
wha... how the hell is that going to help?
i bought you. how did i forget that that is all you do?
way to go robot!
good job alan!
hey, good race you guys.
yeah, see you later!
no! no, no... wait! we did not lose. (turns to chandler) the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
they left.
(into the phone) no, there is not time to go to the bakery. we are just going to come home... everybody left? alright, well just tell emma we are going to be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) bye...
rachel!
ooh! god! sorry!
(sarcastically) i can not believe they gave you a ticket. you are such a good driver.
emma's awake.
yeah?
i can not believe this. this is her first birthday. she is awake. we are not even there. everybody left. we still have this stupid obscene cake.
hey, maybe i can fix that, you know. try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)
oh, why do you even bother? i already ruined her first birthday... and do you know how important these early experiences are ross? very! according to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
rach, she is not going to remember this.
(shakes her head) i guess... oh, i just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "happy birthday". then we would all go into... hey get out of the road you stupid student driver!!! (honks furiously, and ross looks at her in disbelief and rachel looks at him.) they have to learn!
(looks back at the cake) hey!
what?
it is not bad.
(she looks at the cake) oh my god! look what... you made it into a bunny. how did you do that?
well, i just made these two things uhm... cheeks. and then i split this to make ears.
well, I am very impressed.
some can sing, some can dance. i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
I am sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?
game?
emma, you even know it is your birthday today? you are one! one-year-old, that is little.
ooh! that is my girl!
that is how old you are.
did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom?
(embraces emma tightly) ooh, i want one...
me too...
there is no-one around. why do not we just take this one?
...and head to canada!
i was kidding.
i was not. let us get going!
hey, are ross and rachel back?
no, not yet.
oh good, i did not miss the party.
what about your massage client?
i just felt so bad, missing this. so i just slipped him a little something, you know. as long as I am back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
okay, if ross and rachel ask, I have been here the whole time. the whole time!
(to ross and rachel) I have been here the whole time!
joey, we just saw you come in. you ran past us on the stairs.
i do not care that you left. I am just glad that you are here. thanks you guys!
hey, guys! come on! you got to see what emma just did.
what?
emma, how old are you? how old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)
oh! emma, that is right! you are that many!
oh my god! our daughter's a genius! rach, this means...
(angrily) no, no science camp!
damnit! I will put a candle on the cake.
oh!... oh and emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
thanks!
okay, here we go! emma's first birthday cake... well hey... well, blow out the candle. come on emma.
let us do it, come on!
what is wrong? are you okay?
oh yeah, nothing! these are happy tears! this is just what i wanted.
(pointing at cake) hey, you made it into a bunny.
what is wrong with me. it looked more delicious when it was a penis.
okay.
okay, you ready?
yeah.
a-a-and... record.
okay. (they both look into the camera, and ross waves.) hi emma. well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
(yelling at the top of her voice) go, go, go alan! run you, hairy bastard!
okay.
(to monica) okay, i know I am not supposed to know, but i do. and I am so excited for you!
what? what is going on?
monica’s pregnant!
oh my god! is that why you guys had to get married?!
guys! I am not pregnant.
ah. (to chandler) slow swimmers? (chandler looks at him.)
what?! what do you mean? you-you-you are not pregnant?
you did not tell anybody i was did you?!
no! (pause) I will be right back. (exits.)
(to joey) oh, about that. joey, you have to change before the party.
i can not! i-i do not have any other clothes here.
find some! please! anything that does not say i-i died tragically in france. (joey leaves to find clothes.)
okay. (phoebe and rachel join monica and chandler on the altar.) hey mon, why did you tell the guys you were not pregnant?
because I am not.
we found your test in the trash, if you are not pregnant—(she sees rachel shaking her head)—it is because i am.
what?! what are you talking about?
what are you talking about?
yes, i…i am with child. (flash) and i did not want to say anything because it is your day; i did not want to steal your thunder.
wait a minute! so you told people i was pregnant?! (flash) does this look like a conversation that i want to remember?!
who is the father?
yeah!
i can not say.
why?!
why not?
i can not say because he is famous.
oh my god, who is it?! (phoebe rolls her eyes.)
phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
okay, okay. it is james brolin. james brolin is the father of my baby.
as in barbara streisand’s husband james brolin?
what?! well he never said that to me!
how about just the bridemaids?
y’know i am the groom right? i was told it was kind of big deal.
it is.
for you. (chandler leaves.)
oh my god!
oh, thank you for doing that. i just can not deal with this just quite yet.
so instead you told me monica was pregnant.
you said that she was, i just did not disagree with you.
sneaky.
oh yeah.
oh! (they smile and the picture is taken.) oh by the way?
uh-hmm.
james brolin?
oh, i know. i could only think of two names, him and ed begley jr. and then i remembered he is gay.
ed begley jr. is not gay.
(intrigued) really?!
before we go out there I have got a present for ya.
honey, I am going to put my hand in your pocket!
no?
no.
I have been taking dancing lessons.
what?!
yeah, the last six weeks. i wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
oh that is so sweet!
so? would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
yes.
what is the matter?
i do not know, it is these new shoes, they are all slippery.
well, are you going to be able to do this?
not well.
well, the good news is, i do not think anyone’s looking at us.
so, are you ready to talk about it?
no.
now?
no!
okay, we will talk about something else then.
thank you.
who is the father?!
ugh! look honey y’know what? i have not told him yet, so until i do i do not think i should tell anybody else.
yeah. that is fine. that is fair. is it tag?
phoebe!!
okay, I am sorry. I will stop.
okay.
is it ross? it is ross is not it—oh my god, it is joey!
honey, stop it! i am not going to tell you until i tell him.
ah-hah! at least we know it is a him.
(seeing him) oh sweet lord.
I am sorry! okay? i went down to the gift shop and it is either this or a bathrobe! look, what is more important, the way I am dressed or me being with you on your special day?
honey, I am not even going to pretend i was listening. (sees someone else.) hey! hey! (goes over to that person.)
hi. I am uh, I am ross. i do not, i do not believe we have met. I am monica’s older brother.
oh! hello uh, mona from her restaurant. (he uses his card to mouth those words.) (pause) mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
aw come on, mona lisa?
mona umm…clickclocken. the famous botanist? huh? oh no she is uh—well she is dead now. no, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
linda clickclocken. (pause) so what uh, what-what table are you at? (she shows him.) oh, uh me too.
(sexily) yes there will. (mona leaves and ross tries to find the same table.) oh guess what, molly gilbert you have just been bumped up to table one. and if it is all right with you I am going to take your place at table six—martin clickclocken.
that is better, now just bend your arms a little more. there you go. okay, look straight ahead. now this time i want you to really put your ass into it. (they do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)
thank you.
bravo dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
i do not believe we have met, joey tribbiani.
wow, I have admired your work for years. you-you have done some really amazing stuff.
wow dennis phillips! that is great! how did you guys meet?
funny: ha-ha or funny: (mimes blowing his brain out.)
hey! uh, i thought, i thought you were at table six.
oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. well I am… (he goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) hello.
chandler. will you see if your mom can give my resume to dennis phillips? ‘because if i can get in a broadway show then i would have done it all, film, television, and theater. the only think left would be radio, and that is just for ugly people.
what size shoes do you wear?
uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can i borrow the boots from your costume?
uh, i do not even really know where i left those. sorry.
(looking at joey’s feet) those are not eleven and a half.
okay fine! I am a seven! all right, i have surprisingly small feet. but the rest of me is good, I will show ya!
can you believe phoebe got pregnant?!
oh y’know what honey? let us not talk about that right now?
this is so huge.
sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
of course not nothing is. between me and you…
yeah.
…in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
hey! y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they are supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
how?
i do not know! maybe they have tools.
well i-i talked to and uh, she is definitely going to have this baby. y’know, she said she was going to raise it on her own.
well, maybe that is, maybe that is really brave.
maybe. i just hope she realizes how hard it is going to be.
maybe she has not really thought it through that well.
well, there is a lot to think about. i mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? how is she going to juggle work? does she realize she is not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
(starting to cry) i do not know.
are you okay?
uh-hmm. I am just thinking about phoebe; poor knocked up phoebe.
oh yes! thank you very much! (she grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. she then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without monica noticing. it does not work.) oh that is-that is actually how the french drink it.
well, i just got off the phone with my lover, james brolin…
oh really?!
yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. and i said, "james, james brolin, are you sure?" james brolin said…
(interrupting) rachel’s really the one who is pregnant.
(shocked) what?! (deadpan) why bother?
how do you feel?
i do not know. i do not know how i feel. this is all happening so fast. i have to make all these decisions that i do not want to make. (takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) somebody just take this away from me!!
calm down. maybe you are not pregnant.
what?!
when i got pregnant with the triplets, i took that test like three times just to make sure.
yes! maybe it is a false positive. are you sure you peed on the stick right?
how many ways are there to do that?
I am-I am just saying, do not freak out until you are a hundred percent sure.
all right, I will-I will take it again when i get home.
you-you got to take it now. come on, do it as a present to me.
okay. thank you.
okay.
I will run out and get you one.
oh, you guys are so great.
oh, wait a minute! who is is the father?!
oh no, she will not tell us.
oh, come on it is my wedding! that can be my present.
wh—hey, i just gave you peeing on a stick.
see? this is why you register.
it was the chair again! okay? I am not doing it! it what—look, i do not—y’know what—eh-eh… (he walks away and goes over to mona.) hi.
umm, would you like to dance?
yeah?
oh great! (they get up to dance and ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
i was not farting! (to mona) uh, a little game from our table. (to the little girl) yes?
oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. right now, I am about to dance with this lady.
uh, unless! unless, uh this lady would not mind letting you go first.
yes i-i am. in fact umm hey, why do not we try it my special way? you can dance on my feet.
yeah? hop on. (they start dancing and mona sits down.) is the pretty lady looking?
keep dancing.
and the world will never know.
hey! did you talk to dennis about me yet?
yes, i told him how talented you were. i told him all about days of our lives.
no-no! no! no! you do not tell a broadway guy that! now he just thinks I am a soap actor.
but you are not just a soap actor. you are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
hey!
no-no, thank you miranda.
all right. (walks over to mona.)
oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
what? of course you can! hop on!
i am so going to score.
i like your bow.
(clinks his glass) I would like to propose a toast. to monica and chandler, the greatest couple in the world. and my best friends. now, my when i first found out they were getting married i was, i was a little angry. i was like, (overly angry) "why god? why? how can you take them away from me?!" but then i thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (does a fake laugh.) and-and there was some sad memories. (starts to break down and cry.) I am sorry. and-and some scared memories—whoa! (he jumps back, startled.) eh? and then, and then i realized I will always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (starts to walk away, but realizes something.) oh! to the happy couple!
(to the second girl) that was very nice ashley.
no-no. (walks over to mona again.)
oh! (recoils in horror.)
oh, you-you sure? (she nods yes.) okay. (to the girl) okay. so what is uh, what is your name.
that is, that is pretty. (they start to dance and gert tries to step on ross’s feet, but he pulls them out of harm’s way.) whoa! whoa! whoa! what are you doing there gert?
okay. (swallows hard.) hop on gert. (she does and ross winces in pain.)
I am trying. (he strains to move his feet.)
maybe i should stand on your feet! (gert’s shocked and ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)
so did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
well, I would like to think there was something for everyone. look, i know you are casting for this new show…
oh, see that is where you are wrong. whatever it is i can do it. and if did not see it up there, just-just try me.
well I am not proud of this, but… (he turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)
hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
did it turn into sand?
ohh come on, i love this song! come on, you will be fine. (she starts to walk towards the floor.)
(sliding up behind her) no. no, i will not. do you know why i took all those lessons? see, for the first time i did not want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (chandler grunts.) okay, you can easily embarrass me. but come on, it does not matter. all right? i married you! so i want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. come on. (they go onto the floor.) just try not to move your feet at all. (chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) there you go.
why?
how much longer?
30 seconds.
30 seconds, okay.
(entering) did i miss it? (phoebe nods no.) rachel, i-i want you to know that, if it is positive, we are going to…
oh i know. i know. (they hug.)
it is time.
go ahead rach.
oh wait! y’know what? i can not, i can not look at it. i can not. somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.
okay.
okay.
umm, it is negative.
what?
it is negative.
oh. oh. well there you go. whew! (pause) that is—that is great—that is really great-great news. (pause) y’know ‘because the whole not being ready and kind of the financial aspects, all that. whew. wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (starts to cry.) god.
well… well, great.
here. (gives rachel a tissue.)
thanks. (crying) god this is so stupid! (pause) how could i be upset over something i never had? it is negative?
no, it is positive.
what?!
it is-it is not negative, it is positive.
are you sure?
well yeah, i lied before.
oh!
oh god…
now you know how you really feel about it.
oh-oh, that is a risky little game!
are you really going to do this?
yeah. I am going to have a baby. I am going to have a baby. I am going to have a baby! (they all hug.)
with who?
ah, it is still not the time.
i just did not see the fast song coming.
shh. shh. do not try to talk, we will get you up to your room, we will soak your feet, you will be okay.
oh, thank you.
yeah.
tell me about it, i feel like I am holding down the fort all by myself.
yeah.
wait a minute! no! I am the nice one! I am the one who danced with the kids all night! how…how small are your feet?! (they all look down.)
oh hey you guys, i couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner thursday night instead.
thursday? but that�s halloween.
so?
[it�s just] so spooky, that�s all.
so, so, is mike coming to dinner?
no! it�s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. uch, i get mad at him, but i think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.
pheebs, i would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch emma. (to ross:) which one of us should go to dinner?
oh, rachel!
actually, um, i was thinking maybe both of us could go.
oh, yay!
thanks, i put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
alright, okay, so we can all go now. that is fun. hey, you know what? we all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.
what are you talking about? we�re all together right now.
um, mon, chandler�s not here.
oh, dear god!
good morning everyone, it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) yes, ken is it?
(laughs) well, don�t believe everything you hear, ken. (both turning away to files) but yeah, that�s true. alright, let�s get started, by take a look at last quarter�s figures. (the female next to chandler starts smoking, towards her:) ah, claudia, aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?
no, no, no-no-no. i smoked for years, then i quit. right now, i can�t remember why. (to everyone:) you�re not allowed to smoke in this office. not right?
alright, lo�look. i don�t smoke anymore. but if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it�s fine. (everyone lights up) so you all smoke then? that�s almost rude, that i�m not.
(loud) ken, please! no, i can�t, i can�t smoke. if i smoke, my wife would kill me.
i always liked you, ken. (takes a cigarette)
(from outside) trick or treat! (it�s obviously halloween eve, the night of her birthday dinner.)
(opening the door) hey!
ooh, and treat it is. (monica�s breasts.)
hmhmm. (ties up)
wow, so glad i changed. almost wore my ??? outfit that can�t contain my breasts.
this is not, what i�m wearing. i�m ovulating and chandler�s going to be home any minute, so i thought we would try before dinner.
ohh. oh wait! (jis) you guys won�t be late for my dinner, will you?
believe me, chandler and i have not seen each other in over a week. we�ll probably be the first ones there.
�kay, see you there. happy humping! (outside meeting chandler.) hey�hey! oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? oh my god, don�t people know, you�re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
actually, in oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
you smoked!
no! i just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. for example, in hawaii cigarettes are called leyhallalookoos.
(smells at him) chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
uch, do you think, monica is going to be able smell it?
are you kidding? the woman has the nose of a bloodhound � and the breasts of a greek goddess.
pheebs?
(embarrassed) i�m going to go. (leaves to stairs)
(getting in) okay, something to cover the smell � oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) unscented!
(naughty in doorway) welcome home. i�ve missed you. join me in the bedroom?
no thanks, i�m good.
(comes over) of-kay, so you want to play it that way, do you?
(shrinks back) right. you know what? actually i just get off the plane, so i�m feeling kind of gross. maybe i should just take a shower.
you don�t need a shower.
(still backs away) alright, the truth is, i soiled myself during some turbulences.
what do i smell? (sniffs him) i smell smoke. huh�did you smoke?
yes, but i just had one. two. two tiny cigarettes. okay, five. a pack. two pack�a�a carton. three big fat cartons in two days. (how many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the us?) but it�s over, i made a decision, i�m not going to smoke anymore.
(gets a pack out of his jacket)
but, those are for you.
alright, we�ll just, uh, see when you get here. bye. (hangs up) huh, that was my mom, she�s stuck in terrible traffic.
okay, well that�s now the third sign that i should not leave emma.
oh, what were the other two?
well, let�s see. the first one is: i don�t want to. and, you know, i�m not going.
i know, it�s the first time, we�re leaving the baby and � hey, i know how hard it is for you, but � but emma is going to be fine. my mom is going to be with her. she�s great with kids.
she is?
ya.
what about (?) monica.
hey, you only heard monica�s side of that. that little fatso was a terror.
ish. i just don�t think i can bear it.
rachel, i know that you can. and you should.
uch.
really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don�t you, why don�t you go ahead to the restaurant and i will wait for my mom and then i�ll meet you there.
oh-a.
no, no, really. you should go. just go! go! go out! really, the world is your oyster. kick up the heels. paint the town red. (slang right?)
you need to learn some new slang.
i�m serious. c�mon, you should go. here. (shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) no, uh-uh, just go.
what � oh! (points inside)
no! no, you know what? (closes the door) you [can�t get in there] (?), the baby�s fine, now squam (?). yeah, [i told you a|tell your] story walking. (?)
i was just going to say that i left my keys.
oh, (door is locked) holy molly are we in a pickle now.
where is everyone? they�re forty minutes late.
i know, you-uch.
i�m starving. i know we were coming here tonight, i ate nothing all day.
what about me, he? only had one lunch today.
yes, they are expected presently. yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.
no, they�re comin�, we�re waitin� right here.
joseph! (to waiter) thou needn�t worry, they shan�t be long.
one really does have a stick up one�s ass. doesn�t one?
how can you smoke in this day of age? do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it�s chilling.
i messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
so what? don�t you have any will power?
will power? i�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.
you said that was sexy!
�kay, look: can we just drop this? i�m not going to smoke again.
that�s right, because i forbid you to smoke again.
you forbid me?
mhmm.
you know, i flew a long way t see my loving wife? is she here by the way?
don�t joke (?) with me, okay? i�m very, very upset right now.
oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
yes.
then, i might as well � (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). not really sure what to do now.
well, i�ll tell you what we�re going to do: we are already late for phoebe�s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we�re going to put this fight on hold and go have sex.
fine. what!?
sex! this is the last day i�m ovulating, and when we don�t do it now, we�ll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)
you serious? (follows)
oh yeah!
right, fine, i�ll do it, but no talking.
huh, and no cuddling.
and no kissing your neck.
oh good, i hate it when you do that
and lots of kissing your neck.
okay, well the ??? is not home.
no. uch.
oh-oh, wait, my mother is going to be here any minute. and she has the keys.
alright, i can�t, i can�t wait that long. you have to do something�knock that door down!
i would, but i bruise like a peach. besides, y�you know, everything is going to be fine. the baby�s sleeping.
what if she jumped out the bassinet?
can�t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
oh my god, i left the water running.
rach you did not leave the water running. please, just pull yourself together, okay?
ah, did i leave the stove on?
you never cooked since 1996. (actually rachel cooked in �609 - tow ross got high�, first aired 1999-11-25.)
is the window open? because if there�s a window open, a bird could fly in there.
oh my god, you know what, yeah, i think you�re right. i think � listen, listen!
ubb.
a pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared rachel turns away) no, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. landed on the stove and caught fire. the baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird�s aid. the eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.
boy, are you going to be sorry if that�s true.
maybe we should just eat now.
wha-a how about this: another table leaves, right? but there�s still some food left on their place, okay, what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?
but it happens? (waiter leaves) i�m got to go to the bathroom.
no, you can�t go. no-no-no, i can�t hold this table on my own. if they ask me to move, i cave.
if you ask me to stay, i�ll pee. (leaves)
okay, fine, i�ll move. alright, you don�t have to manhandle me. (gets up) where? (he points at a smaller table) okay. thank you. wach.
(returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to phoebe�s chair) pheebs, who the hell�uhuhh!
spend more time with the tie. that�ll make a baby.
look, i can�t do this. i can�t make love to you while we�re fighting this way.
oh sure, now you�re mister sensitivity. but when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle�s funeral
that was a celebration of life. alright, look, i�m not going to do this. alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
no, you�re right. mnya, we shouldn�t do it like this. huch. for what it�s worth, i�m, i�m sorry. i shouldn�t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. so you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
mean it?
yah.
you are incredible. unless, i�i�m not going to smoke again. and if i do, i promise, i will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)
d�you want to?
yeah, let�s celebrate life!
�kay.
och, god. (seeing emma) oh, thank god, you�re okay. i�m so sorry we left you. mom never going to leave you again. never ever ever again. uch.
great. so let�s get going?
oh no. i mean it. after what just happened, i�m never leaving her again.
somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
uhh. you are welcome.
you know what? let�s not talk.
what?
uch. i am still so mad at you for smoking.
but you said you forgave me. it was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.
oh, blablablabaybaybay.
leave it.
i was just saying that because i was ovulating and you said you wouldn�t have sex with me while we�re fighting.
you tricked me to get me into bed?
that�s right, i got mine.
i feel so used.
well, i guess they�re not coming. you want to just order?
thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) waiter! �lright, this is going to be fast, so try to keep up: risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden chanterelles and a bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff i just said means snails. (hope, *i* kept up.)
tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
both it is, thank you.
oh, uh, again. can i make a special request: can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready? appetizers, entrees, we don�t care.
you guys are over an hour late. what happened to you two?
i�m so sorry �
we got locked out of the apartment, we �
that�s a great story�can i eat it?
and then rachel wasn�t sure she could leave the baby.
n-it wasn�t easy, but it�s your birthday and i did what i got to do.
and that�s judy over there at the bar with emma?
oh honey, this is for the best, thus i�m not distracted, worrying about emma, how she�s doing at home and i�m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
what?
she spit up. judy! she spi�judy! look alive, judy! (they sit down) thank you.
thanks. oh.
oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. what should i ha-ave? what should i have?
(mumbling) never hit a woman. never hit a woman.
y�know this ??? is incredible.
ross bruises like a peach. he bruises like a peach.
okay, i�ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
yah, i�ll have the soup and the salmon.
and remember whatever comes up first. okay? and hurry, because �
(entering with husband) happy birthday!
son of a bitch!
wher-where have you been?
well, we had a little fight.
i would never lie to get someone into bed.
you used to tell girls you were a kennedy. (being sat down) ooh, uh, thanks. wow, little tight, isn�t it? how d�you get a bigger table? you-you had a big table, but they made you move. huh-huh, shut up monica. whoo, i suppose that chandler will have the smoked duck.
i suppose that monica will have the � manipulative shrew.
why are you going? he said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)
rach, c�mon, emma is fine. you�re turning into an obsessive mother. okay, you need to stop.
y�guys ever heard the story about when rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
you mean the lully story?
(childish) huh-huh, they already know it.
you guys, we�ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.
(returned) no, no, it�s okay, i already told the waiter what they want.
why would you do that?
chandler, control your woman!
(lifts for a toast) okay, as everybody has ordered, i would like to start the celebration and make a toast � to phoebe. she dropped her sock.
aw � what?
n-no, emma dropped her sock.
mom�s here? i wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
ross, she still has not noticed that the baby�s sock is on the ground.
�s a good toast.
(to ross) could you please get her attention?
w-oa � mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)
(getting up) oh, for god�s sake, judy, pick up the sock! pick up the sock! pick up the sock! (everybody scared) i�m sorry, was that rude? di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? look, i know, you all have a lot going on, but all i wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. and you are all so late and you didn�t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) well, it�s too late now.
well, ??? think that�s us?
well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) hello?
(to chandler and monica) well, what is going on with you two?
uch, you see, i�m ovulating.
oh yeah, that�s what she says. but maybe you�re not ovulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
yes smokie, that is what it was. i just can�t get enough.
(to joey) you not going to believe this: she lied! she tricked me into having sex with her.
so? did have sex, right?
what�s the matter with me? why i�m such a girl?
(returns) okay, that was mike.
phoebe, hi, we�re so sorry. you�re totally right. we are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. huh, nkay, i�m going to take off.
what?
oh, i love you guys too, but mike got off work early. wait. wait, i�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. you know what? i am. bye guys! (waves to the bar) judy! bye.
oh thank god, if phoebe�s going, can we please take emma home?
you know, i think that�s a good idea�our babysitter just pounded in another chardonnet. (both get up) bye, y�guys.
bye.
see ya. well, this is just us.
so, i�m, i�m probably still ovulating. do you want to give it another try?
so you never had sex with a kennedy, have you?
do, do you going to do it now?
we don�t have much time. once the egg descended the oviduct �
no-ohoh. (the bings leave, the waiter comes)
nah, just me. all alone. (all the food is served) dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
excellent. the shrew in particular was exclusive.
joey! joey.
that�s the best birthday ever.
hey, it is your thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
okay, rachel, you want to put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
no mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. i want to do this.
every year.
y'know, for once, i am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).
halftime.
hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
oh! that would be sooo much fun!
oh, can i play too? I have never played football, like ever.
great, you can cover chandler.
no, no, no, i do not, i do not really want to play.
come on man! you never want to do anything since you and janice broke up.
that is not true! i wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. i wanted to start drinking in the morning. do not say that i do not have goals!
chandler, you have to start getting over her. all right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it will take your mind off janice, and if you do not play, everyone will be mad at you ‘because the teams will not be even. come on.
yeah, all right, I will play.
yay!!
let us do it! ross?
what?
do you want to play football?
um, monica and i are not supposed to play football.
says who? your mom?
well, every, every thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘geller bowl.’
no, no, no, you say that proudly.
anyway, ross and i were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, geller bowl vi, i accidentally broke ross’s nose.
it was soo not an accident. she saw i was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. and just keep running.
to score the winning touchdown, by the way.
whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown did not count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
(to chandler and joey) i won the game.
oh yeah! then how come you did not get the geller cup?
um, there was a geller cup?
yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. but our dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.
and was the curse lifted?
anyway. that is when our mom said we were not to play football ever again.
y'know what, i think we should play a game. i mean come on, it is been twelve years.
can i see you for a second?
(shouting) once!!
all right, we are going to play.
but wait a minute though, how are we going to get there, though, because my mom will not let me cross the street.
okay. let us bring it in.
wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
here you go. (throws her the ball)
(knocking it down instead of catching it) that almost hit me in the face.
all right, we have to pick captains.
and then tineals.
okay, so how do we decide that?
well, why do not we just bunny up.
okay, looks like ross and i are captains. okay, so um, i bunnied first so that means i get to pick first. joey.
thank you.
monica, I am your best friend.
sweetie, do not worry you will get picked. chandler.
ross!
phoebe.
sweetie, now i pick you.
you do not pick me! you are stuck with me!
okay. all right. so let us see, let us play from the trash can, to the lightpost. right. two hand touch, we will kick off.
all right people listen, I have got exactly twenty-eight minutes before i have to baste again.
wow! just like in the pros.
huddle up.
(to his team) all right, huddle up, right over here.
wait for me! wait for me! wait for me! oh cool, this is my first huddle.
okay.
okay, so what do you guys really think of chandler?
okay, phoebe you know what you are doing right?
yeah.
okay, joey’s going to catch it, and you and i are going to block.
what is block?
phoebe, i thought you said you know what you are doing?
i thought you meant in life.
break.
the ball is janice. the ball is janice. (goes to kick the ball but kicks ross’s foot instead.)
oww!! son of a...!! ow! come on!
sorry. I am sorry. y'know what, we are just going to throw it.
i got it. (catches the ball)
go! go! go!
score!! 7 to nothing!
(coming over to ross, who is just getting up) are you okay?
come on, let us go!
losers walk!
yeah, losers talk!
no, no, no, actually losers rhyme.
(coming up under center, just like a real quarterback does, and puts his hands between ross’s legs.) twenty-three!! seventy-four!! (ross stands up and looks at him) you want to go shotgun?
yeah!
(from the shotgun) hike!
over here!
(proud of her self) i almost caught that one!
great! now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
okay, (to chandler) this play, i want you to do a down and out to the right. okay. break!
wait, what am i going to do?

pulling what? it is second down.
okay, it is second down. (turns away) take all the second downs you need.
i heard that!
well, i said it loud.
well, that went well.
i think so.
y'know, i was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
thanks man, but i think it makes a stronger statement if i ask for it myself, y'know.
whoa-ho, whoa! no, i was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over janice thing you were talking about.
oh, yeah, that. all right, means that much to ya, I will let you have her.
thanks. what, let me have her?! what do mean? like if you did not i would not have a shot?
well i do not like to say it out loud, but, yeah! do not feel bad man, we all have our strengths. you are better with numbers and stuff.
math!! you are giving me math! all right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, we will see who gets her.
chandler, i want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. and sweetie..
yeah, i know, go long. y'know, it is like all I am doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
well ah, you want to just stay out there?

what the hell’s the matter with you?! this is my favourite jersey.
well now you have two. hey, i am good at math.
all right, that is it. y'know i was still going to let you have her. but now, forget about it. prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
hey! well, I have been preparing for that my entire life! or something about you that is mean!
all right, come on guys, let us go! tie score, and we are runnin’ out of time. forty-two!! thirty-eight!! hike! (the timer sounds as monica throws the ball to phoebe.)
oh i got it!! (catches the ball) oh! ew! broken boob! ow!
pheebs, run!
run, phoebe, run!
touchdown!! touchdown!!
uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. it does not count.
after the snap!
before the snap!
after!!
before!!
now, does it really matter?
well, okay, i made a touchdown. it was my first touchdown. so?
oh pheebs, that is great. it does not count.
does so count!
cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
oh my god!
y'know what, that is fine, maybe you have not grown up, but i have.
oh-ho, okay.
dead leg!! (kicks him in the thigh.)
ow! ow! okay, okay, fine, fine! all right, you want to win by cheating, go ahead, all right. phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.
woo-yay!!
no! listen, I am not going to go through this with you again, okay. just once i want to beat when you can not blame it on the broken nose, the buzzer, or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. let us just call this, tie score and it is halftime.
okay, first of all, i do not play with cheaters, and second of all, you know i had swollen glands!!
y'know what? I will think you will play.
oh really! why is that?
because the winner gets this!
the geller cup.
is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
okay, good.
okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
when mom and dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, i swam into the lake and fished it out.
that cup is mine!
no it is not! you want it, you are going to have to win it!
all right, so are we not having dinner at all?
come on phoebe, let us go! come on, it is time to get serious, huddle up. joey, keep your head in the game.
it is hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to dutch girl.
all right look, if i take chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
what are you going to do?
all right, you just make sure that chandler catches the ball, I will take care of the rest.
okay.
break!
here you go!
chandler! chandler!
(to margha) hi.
whoa! whoa!! tackled by a girl! bet ya do not see that everyday, do ya?
whoa! whoa! whoa! what is with the tackling?
what?! i just touched him and he went over.
okay, you want to play rough, we can play rough.
i love this game!!
hey, where did you get that?
i went really long.
forty-two to twenty-one! like the turkey, ross is done!
it is no surprise that your winning, ‘because you got to pick first, so you got the better team.
you are so pathetic! why can not you just accept it, we are winning because I am better than you.
oh, what a great argument, exhaling! all right, y'know what, I will prove it to you, okay. I will trade you joey for rachel, and I will still win the game.
what?! the guys against the girls? see, that is ridiculous monica, because I am only down by three touchdowns.
oh, then bring it on! oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
fine, fine, rachel your with monica, joey you are with me.
i can not believe your trading me!!
come on rach, come on. let us see what is it like to be on a winning team for a change.
are you going to let me play?
all right then.
no-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we are just switching teams.
yeah, chandler finds me so intimdating that it is better if we are on the same team.
right. okay, let us play. let us go.
no ah, hold on a second joe, where do dutch people come from?
ah well, the ah, pennsylvania dutch, come from pennsylvania.
and the other ah, dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the netherlands, right?
nice try. (to margha) see the netherlands is this make believe place where peter pan and tinker bell come from.
enough with geography for the insane, okay? let us play some ball, guys.
whoa, whoa, no, no, i-I am not playing with this guy, now.
fine with me.
okay, y'know what, let us just cut to the chase here. okay? heidi, which of my boys do you like?
yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
yes!!
wait a minute! wait a minute! she obviously did not understand the question.
well, you do not you have captain hook explain it to her.
you hear that! that is her chose, mister I will let you have her! i win! you suck! i rule all! a mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)
wh-what?
nice going. you just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
y'know what, it does not matter, ‘because she picked me. me! from now on i get the dates and you have to stay home on saturday nights watching ready, set, cook!
save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. the clock is ticking. we have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
we are not going to lose to girls.
hey! it is 42-21!
this sucks, i was just up by that much!
are we playing football or what? come on you hairy-backed marries.
we have to do this. we are playing for women everywhere. okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the tv while you are making out...
oh my god! you dated someone with a glass eye too?!
come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. let us kill ‘um!
yeah!!! kill ‘um!!!
all right, no, well i want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we going to beat three boys?
all right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we are down by two points. two points.... (she gets interrupted by the guys, who are doing a slow-motion high five.) phoebe you do a button-hook again. rachel, you go long.
no! come on! do not make me go long. use me. they never cover me.
honey, there is a reason.
god, I am not lame, okay. i can do something. i can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
come on mon, let her throw the ball.
all right rachel, you sweep behind, I will pitch it to you, you throw it down field to phoebe. all right. break.
thank you! break!
thirty-two! seventy-one! hike!
I am so sorry! are you okay?
no! I am not okay!
I am sorry, they were just all coming at me, and i did not know what to do.
(looking at the timer) thirty seconds left on the timer!
okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!
come on! come on! hurry! we are running out of time! huddle up!
okay. oooh! oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
all right, phoebe get open. rachel, go long.
(on the verge of tears) okay.
break!
(in triumph) i got a touchdown! we did it!!
hey-hey-hey rachel, funny thing. actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so you are five feet short, so we win!
wait-wait-wait-wait! so, explain something to me though, if, if nobody tagged rachel, then is not the play still going.
let go! let go!
let go! I am a tiny little woman!!
guys! guys! come on! it is thanksgiving, it is not important who wins or loses. the important thing is, (to joey) the dutch girl picked me! me! not you! holland loves chandler! thank you, amsterdam! good night!!
ow!!
we should defiantly play football more often. maybe there is a like league we could join or something.
is not there a national football league.
yes. yes, there is, they play on sundays and monday nights.
oh shoot! i work monday nights.
umm, this stuffing is amazing. do you think we should bring them some?
when they are hungry enough, they will come in.
let go!
no! you let go!
no!
how come it is always us left in the field holding the ball?
i do not know. i guess the other people just do not care enough.
hey! it is starting to snow.
give me the this!
let go!
hey.
hey.
what are you doing?
well, y’know i was thinking of moving the couch over here.
(laughs) why would you want to do that?
so that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
rach, there is a decent place to…
and your lap does not count! okay? come on help me move this.
no. no. no.
no?
no. rosita does not move.
I am sorry, rosita? as in…
as in rosita does not move.
joey, it is just a chair! what is the big deal?
the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it is at the perfect angle so you do not get any glare coming of off stevie.
stevie the tv?
(glaring at her) is there a problem?
no! (joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.) oh what does he know! come on rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (she tries pulling on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) you bitch!
hey, y’know what is weird? after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you are going to have to say, "this is my brother-in-law ross." not, "my friend ross," "brother-in-law ross." that is weird is not it?
could not i just say, "this is ross?"
(disappointed) sure, do whatever you want.
(entering, carrying a newspaper) hey ross! so, i was checking out the uh, real estate section…
yeah?
look at this. (hands him the newspaper.)
oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…oh my god!!
what? what happened to the window in the attic?!
i can not believe mom and dad are selling the house!
i can not believe they-they did not even tell us!
i can not believe i still do not know what happened to the window in the attic!
(on phone) uh, hello dad! monica and i just saw the house in the paper! (listens) yes we are surprised! (listens) who did you leave a message with?
(knocking on the window while outside) sorry! (runs off.)
joey, joey i am so sorry.
i told you not to move it! rach, how would you feel if say, i wanted to move you mom, and you said do not, and i did it anyway and her head fell off?
okay, come on—joey, I will buy you a new one! all right? we will go down to the store right now and we will-we will get you a new chair.
(slowly turning and glaring at her) she is not even cold yet!
but do not you think rosita would have wanted you to move on? i mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.
that is true.
(grabbing her coat) okay? you ready?
yeah, i… (shuts off the tv.) i do not want stevie to see her like this.
i can not believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. man, some-some stranger’s going to be living in my room.
well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it is time the velvet ropes came down.
they kept your room for a while.
oh please! dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out! i got to say, a tanning bed and a stack of victoria’s secret catalogues, not a gym!
come on, you know they love you.
as much as they love you?
i was their first born! they thought she was barren! it is not my fault.
(entering) hey.
hey.
hey!
ugh, i hate this year!
what is wrong with this year?
well okay, it is already february and I have only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
that was me and ross.
oh that is right!
hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
oh that is a great idea. you are really good on the phone.
yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had. y’know, i probably would not have to say spank as much. (monica and ross are shocked.)
what?
oh yeah, like you never called!
okay, i can do that! oh, by the way, i love my office.
oh okay. umm, all right. (picks up the phone and starts reading from the script.) hi, this is phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please?
umm, okay i would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
oh okay, well I am sorry to bother you. bye-bye. (hangs up the phone.) yeah you are right, this is easy.
oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
oh.
no. (pause) oh wait yes! i do, i do have one question. what is toner?
joey! joe! (sees that he is not here and starts investigating. he picks up the bag of chips.) full bag. (he picks up the beer.) beer’s still cold. something terrible must have happened here! (he decides it is not that important; sits down on rosita, and the back falls off causing him to flip over.) oh no-no-no-no-no-no! (runs over to stevie.) stevie, i was never here! (runs out.)
dad?
(entering with monica) hey!
dad, we-we can not believe you are selling the house.
(to monica) let us grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
oh, that is okay, i can not wait to see everything again! all of the memories…
i used to love to play restaurant.
yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! (she goes to the attic.)
wow! great! (finds a pack of cigarettes.) wait, dad who-who is cigarettes are these?
cool! dad! my report cards! hey, check this out dad, (reading his grades) math, a. science, a. history, a. gym…(he puts it away and finds something else.) oooh, my rock polisher!
it is a clown kit! clown kit!
what?
how are you ever going to sell this place?
oh no. dad! dad! what…(he goes to open one of her boxes and it rips apart.) oh god…everything’s ruined! dad, she is going to be crushed!
no!
(on phone) hi, this phoebe from empire office supplies, can i speak to your supply manager please? (listens) earl, thanks. (listens) hi earl, this is phoebe from empire office supplies I would like to talk to you about your toner needs. (she is reading from the script.)
I am hearing what you are saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
may i ask why?
i surely do!
(does not have any luck) umm, is-is that because you are out of toner?
no-no wait-wait! i can not just let you hang up! just please talk to me.
yeah! now, why do you want to kill yourself?
chandler?
no look, i-I am sure that people know you exist!
my chair. now, if anybody asks, your name is rosita! (he runs out the door, grabs the back of rosita, and we can hear joey and rachel talking as they are coming up the stairs. neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
you will like it!
no i will not.
you do not even know!
because, i know what i like and what i do not like! it is not the same thing!
well look, if you do not like this…(the audience’s laughter at chandler’s progress cuts out the rest of rachel’s line.)
i do not know why you say that so soon.
come on joey, i just bought you a new chair! the most expensive one in the store! hey, y’know what i was thinking? we could name her francette.
francette? what is she? a couch?
poor thing. cut down in her prime.
joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. maybe we should actually move rosita out of here. y’know, start the heeling process?
well, i guess you are right. maybe, maybe I will take her down to the incinerator. it is going to be so said, and kind of cool. (he goes to remove the back, but it does not come off. so he sits down in it, puts his feet up, stands up, and looks back at it.) she is heeled!
that is weird.
no it is not weird, it is a miracle!
it is not a miracle joey! I am sure there is some explanation.
oh there is! if you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
joey, i really do not…
(interrupting her) can you tell me how this happened?
well no.
miracle!
no, y’know what? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! or something!
someone like an…angel?
that is right joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. (she sits down in the chair.)
(angrily) get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (she gets up and heads for her room.)
dad that will not matter to her. look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! see, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
well, can you blame her?
dad, dad i do not want to hear about it.
well, not right now. okay look, monica came here for some memories and damnit, we are going to give her some! okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. okay? we will-we will take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we will-we will put ‘them in their.
like uh y’know like this! this! (he picks up one of those art projects that kids make in kindergarten and first grade.) she-she could have made this!
right? and this! (he picks up a trophy) she-she could have won this!
sure! ooh-ooh, what about this?
(grabbing a beer out of the chair’s fridge) i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself!
yeah, me too. (he flips up his armrest in disgust.)
hey, how is…how is the uh, miracle chair?
fine.
yeah? wow! y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
no. really?
yeah! you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio!
(quietly) my chair heels itself.
earl, you are not hearing me! all I am saying is that you are not alone all right? everybody hates the people they work with! (one of her coworkers overhears that, and she mimes that she did not mean him.)
wait, what was that? that sounded like someone being nice to you.
all right so earl, let us just forget about the people at the office, okay? there-there is got to be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! what about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?
oh sorry, boyfriend!
no, whatever! anything!
yeah, he is got to go.
no! I am not finished yet! do not! do not you dare hang up on me!!!
hey guys! hey!
hey.
hey, i just whipped us up some easy bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.
(overacting as well) yeah! yeah! (laughs.) oh, this will make a great memory.
(wary) okay. so, which boxes are mine?
well, these. these are yours right here. (pointing to the boxes they just created for her.)
okay. (starting to go through them) oh! a coloring book! (holding it up.)
yeah. yeah, oh you loved that thing. you always had it with you. you never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
(looking through it) really? wow! it looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines.
nu-uh! (grabs it and examines it.)
(holding up a glove) oh, an old glove?
wow! look at this! (picking up a shirt.) i can not believe i even fit into this shirt! (she holds it up and it reads: tyrannosaurus ross.) (she turns it around and looks at it.) oh, this is yours. (hands it to ross.)
oh, i do not know how that got in there.
(holding up a small cowboy hat) this is not mine. (sets it down and looks at the rest of the boxes.) hey, this is not, this is not my stuff! ugh, ross! (grabs and holds up a doll.) these are your boxes! where are my boxes?
umm, your boxes are umm…
what?
dad?
just mine?
so why-why was not ross’s stuff ruined? (pause) and if you say the words medical marvel I am going to easy bake your head!
so wait, ross’s stuff is fine, but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
i can not believe this! (storms out.)
hey chandler!
hey!
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?
yeah, I would love to but I have tried that so many times they will not even let me in the store anymore.
well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment?
(excitedly) are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year?
i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000. (which is an actual product by the way, I am not sure about the 3000 part.)
that is awesome! that is great! what made you do it?!
well, it is a long story, but umm i broke joey’s chair…
whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joey’s chair?
yeah.
i thought i broke joey’s chair! that is why i replaced it with mine!
ohhhhh. that is how it got fixed!
well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
noo! (laughs) angels.
I am gettin’ my chair back! (heads for joey and rachel’s.)
what? wh-hey!
well, it looks like it was not heeled after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now! (sits down in it and groans.)
joey you broke my chair!!
your chair?!
yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
so, there was no miracle?!
no joe, no miracle.
(sarcastic) oh no this is devastating! my faith is shaken. I am so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
uh-huh! nice try, but you do not get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now! you can sit on my lap! (joey starts to get up.) no i take that back!
i think i should get the chair!
how do you figure?
because you (points to joey) broke a chair and you (points to rachel) broke a chair! the only one around here that has not broke a chair, is me!
no-no-no! this chair’s not going anywhere.
well, where is the logic in that?!
the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing!
that is right!
what are you guys? like a gang or something?!
yeah! we are!
we are the cobras!
(to marge) excuse me! can you tell me where i can find earl? he is the supply manager around here.
(goes over to his desk) earl! I am phoebe.
umm, look it, you-you can not kill yourself.
no-no i can not! i can not let you do it!
because it was fate that made me call you today!
no! think about it okay? this is not even my regular job! okay? and my first day on the job, you are my first call! and-and somebody else might have hung up on you, but i would not do that because i know about this stuff. my mom killed herself.
yes.
I am not going to give you tips! look do not you see that this-this…this all came together so that i could stop you from doing this.
no, it is fate!
oh. well umm, okay here is a weird thing. my mother was also a supply manager.
oh my god! so was she! and! get this, okay? your-your name is earl, right? her name was pearl, p-earl.
sure! (thinks.) umm, where are you from?
oh my god! so was she! oh, I have got-I have got goose bumps. (she holds out her arm.)
well, y’know I am wearing layers and it is warm.
but if—no look, okay. these jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! and that says a lot!
y’know, i do not-i do not think it is you. this is a freaky place. (to all) hey! guys! (everyone looks up.) (to earl) oh no, it is you.
oh, this terrible! everything is destroyed! look at this. (she picks up some kind of furry thing.) it obviously meant enough for me to save it, and i do not even know what it is! ohh, it is still soft. (she rubs it against her cheek.) what do you think this is?
all right. i think it was a mouse.
how do you think i am?! you have wrecked all my childhood memories. you love ross more than me. and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
(opening it) what is this?
(shocked) what?!
(even more shocked) what?!!!
wait, you are giving me your porsche, you are kidding me right?!
well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! i mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a porsche?!
all right!
well, what about me?! I am a medical marvel!!
oh yeah.
ahhhh….
ahhh…… (to rachel) eh?
uh-huh.
(entering) hey guys!
hey!
hey!
do you guys know what happened to chandler’s barca lounger?
oh yeah, joey broke it. had to get rid of it.
are you kidding?! i get a porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! this is the best day ever! (runs out.)
(entering) hey! hey! hey! hey!! none of that, not while you are living under my roof!
what?!
look, just because i know about you two, does not mean i like looking at it.
are not you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
well, I am sorry if I am not a middle-aged black woman! (starts for his room.) and I am also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition! okay, look, if i have to pretend i do not know about you two, then you two are going to have to pretend there is nothing to know about.
sorry.
sorry.
(from the bedroom) i can hear that!
(to chandler) rachel's at work.
i can still hear you!
hey!
hey!
hello!
hey, what is that?
yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. can you believe it?! a year ago i did not even have a family, and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud.
eeeee-(she opens the box and removes its contents and sees that it is a fur coat.)-ohh!! god! (she throws it at joey.)
argh-argh!! (catches the coat.) ooh, soft. is this mink?
yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? does not she know me but at all! plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. chandler sees her reaction.) that did not happen, i made that up!
(entering) hey!
how come? everybody else does.
what is that?
oh, umm, I am just getting rid of a couple of things.
(looking at the flyer) this is all of your things.
yes, yes it is! no, but it is good it is—emily thinks we should get all new stuff. stuff that is just ours, together. y'know brand new.
so basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-rachel-ever-used sale.
touched. used. sat on. sleep on.
hey, ross, you are okay with that?
look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, I am sure everything will be fine.
okay, but do not you think this is a little extreme?
after what i did? can you blame her?
oh my god! you got off easy! when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
(after ross is gone) what is he doing? what, emily, thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies?
now calm down joey.
no! everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? emily will not let ross see rachel, we are not going to stop seeing rachel, hence ross stops seeing us!
oh, i hate this. everything's changing.
yeah i know, we are losing ross, joey said hence…
look, I am not happy about this either, but y'know if-if ross says he is happy then we are just going to have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves. are you cool with that?
no! but y'know, I am an actor, I will act cool.
ohh, whoa god! storage rooms give me the creeps! monica, come on please hurry up honey! please?
rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you got to have to wait until i find the little waffle iron.
i want the little round waffles.
all right. (looking through a box.) op, here it is! right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
okay, y'know what? I will-I will have toast!
arghhhh!!!!!!
oh my god! fog him! fog him!
i do not know what I am going to do about this coat.
I will take it!
that might work! (she gives him the coat.)
ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (he drapes it around his shoulders.) enh? all right, what do you think?
you are on in 5 ms. minnelli.
(on the phone) no-no-no, it is just a bit sudden. (listens) no, it is great. okay? I am totally on board. i love you too, all righty. bye. (hangs up.)
what is the matter ross?
nothing. oh, actually, great news! i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like I am moving to a new apartment. woo-hoo!
why?
well, her thought is, and i agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? her cousin has this great place to sublet, it is got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other.
that is way uptown! that is like three trains away! (phoebe pinches him.) which is great! i love to ride that rail!
so you are really okay with this?
yes! yes! i mean it is-it is kind of far from work, but uh, y'know, I will get so much done on the commute. i-I have been given the gift of time!
now that is so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum.
now he is movin'? man, what is emily doing to him? (phoebe pinches him again.) ow!! he is not even here!!!
you guys! you guys!
we were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
it was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! he was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
and he came at us with an axe, so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
(proud of herself) yeah, i-i-i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass!
uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
yeah!
yeah, you fogged danny.
please! we did not fog danny! who is danny?
dan just moved in downstairs. yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the andes. nice fella.
oh he is nice. he is nice! y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
hi! you might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
we are-we are really sorry we fogged you.
hi! just so you know, we-we did not mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
hi! sorry to bother you, but i do not think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just does not really seem like you mean it.
yeah.
wow! that guy is so rude!
really! what is with that guy? i mean you would forgive me if i fogged you.
well you did a little bit.
oh my god, honey, I am so sorry!
i totally forgive you!
really?
yes!
hey!
hey!
so listen, you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium?
crematorium chris? sure!
he says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm, y'know, bring in the next person i know who dies.
oh my god! oh my god, look at these pelts!
do not get too attached, she is having it cremated.
what? uhh, phoebe, honey, honey, i know you are quirky and i get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! not nature, fashion!
this is fashion?! (grabs the coat from rachel.) okay, so to you, death is fashion?! that is really funny. (she puts the coat on and starts to model it.) here is phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry russia. i mean, you really thing this looks good? (sees herself in the mirror.) because i do.
(on phone) i know i miss you too. i can not wait to see you. i love you. bye. (hangs up.)
okay, what is in here? rocks?
no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
so, rocks.
I am really going to miss this apartment. y'know, ben-ben took his first steps right over there. (points.)
ohh. hey, remember when i ran into this thing (the shutters that close off the kitchen.) and it kind of knocked me out a little?
i loved this place! to tell you the truth, i wish i did not have to move.
uhh, are you saying that you are not entirely happy about this?
well, i mean if uh, if emily gave me a choice…
you do have a choice!! ross, why are you listening to her?! are you, are you crazy?!
why?
it is not right what emily wants you to do! she is totally-(the gang enters behind joey and phoebe pinches him again.)-owww!! stop pinching me! look, now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right? well he just told me that he is not entirely happy.
what is going on?
we all hate emily!
nooo!!
no, ross, we do not hate emily. we-we just, we just think that you are having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
yeah!
look, we just think that maybe she is being a little unreasonable.
yes! yes! unreasonable!
unreasonable? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! all right, it is about compromise! do you always like it? no! do you do it? yes! because it is not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at central perk all the time! it is real life, okay? it is what grown-ups do! (he storms out.)
i think he is right. you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
god, i feel so guilty about ross.
oh, i know.
i kind of feel like it is my fault.
kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would have happened.
well, I am keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (he glares at chandler.)
well, i think it is very brave what you said.
all right, i can not sit here anymore. i have to walk places. (she puts on her fur coat.)
pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?
well, I have been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. okay, i admit it! i love this coat! okay, i—it is the best thing I have ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley! (she starts to leave but stops and says to monica.) remember phil huntley? he was fine!
hi!
what? yeti—i mean danny?
oh. listen, I am so sorry. i would, i would have never fogged you if y'know if you had not looked so…. y'know.
(shocked) what?
what? hey! no-no-no! this not cool! you do not even know me!
so from that you think you have got me all figured out? well, you do not! y'know i-i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with capri pants.
and stop saying that! i hate that!
fine! i judged you. i made a snap judgement. but you did it too! and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! you can not even open up your mind for a second to see if you are wrong! what does that say about you?
what?!
okay. okay.
uh, ross?
are you still mad at us?
yep.
oh good! because we have an "I am sorry" song.
y'know what? I am really not in the mood.
look, ross, i feel really bad. i mean, you are going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk.
yeah, we are so sorry.
(to chandler) you are kind of stepping on the song. (she gets ready to play but is stopped by…)
look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
whatever you decide, whatever you do.
okay, now you are just taking lines right out of the song!
look, this is hard enough! i really need you guys right now.
yes! exactly! and that is why…
why do not you come over tonight? and I will make you favorite dinner.
okay. thanks you guys. pheebs are you wearing fur?
okay, let us get some perspective people; it is not like I am wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
hey, y'know ross, i think i kind of understand why i kind of lost it today.
you do, huh?
yeah you see umm, well, I am an actor. right? so i got to keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? see what I am saying? i got to lot of balls in the air. (makes like he is juggling.) y'know what i mean? it is tough! guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you are alone…
what are you talking about?
(thinks) I am not sure.
(entering) hi!
hey, look at you! where have you been?
oh, i went to have pizza. with danny.
how did that happen?
that yeti is one smooth talker.
i hope you are not full, because dinner's almost ready.
yeah, y'know i-i think I am just going to hang out in my room.
come on you guys! listen, if emily knew i was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. it is okay, i really… i do not mind.
wait! wait! wait! y'know what? just stay. please? it uh… it would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
ross, i…
rachel please!!! just have dinner with us!!!
okay. okay. joey, it is okay. settle down.
all right, i-I am sorry. I am sorry. you see rach I am an actor…
hey! hey, look! ugly naked guy's back!
i have not seen him in so long!
oh god, i really missed that fat bastard!
wow, this is so weird. i just realized this might be the last time we will all be hanging out together.
it is almost as if he knew.
I will get it. (on phone.) hello. (listens.) hi emily! (listens.) yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. hold on one second. (she hands the phone to ross.)
hey! (listens.) yeah-yeah, we are just having dinner. (listens.) uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. (to the gang.) she wants to say hi. (to emily) hold on.
hi emily!
hi!
well uh, i do not know about who is here, but i can tell you for damn sure who is not here and that is rachel!!
y'know what? uh, rachel is here! (rachel stops.)
oh yeah, there-there she is!
yeah, yeah, she is here.
(on phone) hi.
(going onto the patio) look emily, I am just having dinner with my friends, okay?
emily that is ridiculous. look, I am-I am moving for you, I am cutting friends out of my life for you. please, just get on the plane and come to new york. okay, you will see you are the only person i want to be with.
well, you can not know where i am all the time. look, this marriage is never going to work if you do not trust me.
so, can you trust me?
i think it is going okay. looks like he is smiling.
how can you tell? you can only see the back of his head!
you can totally tell! here look, watch me. (he stands up and turns his back to them so that he is facing the window.) smile! frown. smile! frown. (the camera cuts to ross outside hanging up the phone.) smile! (ross turns around and sees joey alternately smiling and frowning and just stares at him for a second and heads back inside.)
well, i guess that is it.
what happened? what happened?
my marriage is over.
oh, sweetie. oh, look at you. you are shivering.
here. (she wraps her coat around his shoulders.)
ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
yeah. you can help me get my furniture back from gunther.
(to the squirrel) okay, stop tormenting me! this mink! okay, they are mean! and they hate squirrels! and y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! (the squirrel stares at her.) all right, fine, now i get it. (to the clerk.) here. (she hands him her coat.) you take it. (to the squirrel.) are you happy now? I am cold!
(entering) hi guys!
hey. oh, oh, how did it go?
um, not so good. he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again!'
what? he said 'we should do it again', that is good, right?
uh, no. loosely translated 'we should do this again' means 'you will never see me naked'.
since when?
since always. it is like dating language. y'know, like 'it is not you' means 'it is you'.
or 'you are such a nice guy' means 'I am going to be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
or, or, y'know, um, 'i think we should see other people' means 'ha, ha, i already am'.
and everybody knows this?
yeah. cushions the blow.
yeah, it is like when you are a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
that is funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
uh, ross.
what? wh- hello? the millners' farm in connecticut? the millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....oh my god, chi chi!
"so how does it feel knowing you are about to die?"
"warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you will have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
hey, that was really good!
thanks! let us keep going.
okay. "so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?"
"i just want to go back to my cell. because in my cell, i can smoke."
"smoke away."
i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone.
what?
relax your hand!
not so much!
whoah!
hey!
hey!
alright, now try taking a puff.
alright.. okay. no. give it to me.
no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette.
it is fine, it is fine. look, do you want to get this part, or not? here.
do not think of it as a cigarette. think of it as the thing that is been missing from your hand. when you are holding it, you feel right. you feel complete.
y'miss it?
nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke. (takes a puff.) oh.. my.. god. (he continues to smoke.)
no, no, no. they say it is the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
that is ridiculous!
can i use.. either thumb?
(carrying a tray of drinks) alright, do not tell me, do not tell me! (starts handing them out.) decaf cappucino for joey.. coffee black.. late.. and an iced tea. I am getting pretty good at this!
(leaving to serve others) good for me!
y'okay, phoebe?
yeah- no- I am just- it is, i have not worked- it is my bank.
what did they do to you?
it is nothing, it is just- okay. I am going through my mail, and i open up their monthly, you know, statement-
easy.
- and there is five hundred extra dollars in my account.
oh, satan's minions at work again...
yes, because now i have to go down there, and deal with them.
what are you talking about? keep it!
it is not mine, i did not earn it, if i kept it, it would be like stealing.
yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
okay. okay, let us say i bought a really great pair of shoes. do you know what I would hear, with every step i took? 'not-mine. not-mine. not-mine.' and even if i was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
we are with you. we got it.
okay. I would- just- I would never be able to enjoy it. it would be like this giant karmic debt.
chandler, what are you doing?
(puling him up) hey. whaddya doing?
what is this?!
I am smoking. I am smoking, I am smoking.
oh, i can not believe you! you have been so good, for three years!
and this- is my reward!
hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
okay, so this time i will not quit!
all right! I am putting it out, I am putting it out. (he drops it in phoebe's coffee.)
oh, no! i- i can not drink this now!
alright. I am going to go change, I have got a date.
this alan again? how is it going?
's'going pretty good, y'know? it is nice, and, we are having fun.
so when do we get to meet the guy?
let us see, today's monday... never.
no. not after what happened with steve.
what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry.
look, i do not even know how i feel about him yet. just give me a chance to figure that out.
well, then can we meet him?
nope. schhorry.
i mean, why should i let them meet him? i mean, i bring a guy home, and within five minutes they are all over him. i mean, they are like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
i know. i just wish that once, I would bring a guy home that they actually liked.
let it go, ross.
yeah, well, you did not know chi chi.
do you all promise?
(shouts to chandler) chandler? do you promise to be good?
you can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
hey, pheebs.
'dear ms. buffay. thank you for calling attention to our error. we have credited your account with five hundred dollars. we are sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you will accept this- (searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' do you believe this?! now i have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
what bank is this?
hey. it is him. (on the intercom) who is it?
(shouting to chandler) chandler! he is here!
(to all) okay, please be good, please. just remember how much you all like me.
hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan.
(to alan) thanks. I will call you tomorrow. (alan exits, to all) okay. okay, let us let the alan-bashing begin. who is going to take the first shot, hmm?
c'mon!
...I will go. let us start with the way he kept picking at- no, I am sorry, i can not do this, can not do this. we loved him.
wait a minute! we are talking about someone that I am going out with?
and did you notice...? (she spreads her thumb and index finger.)
know what was great? the way his smile was kind of crooked.
yes, yes! like the man in the shoe!
...what shoe?
from the nursery rhyme. 'there was a crooked man, who had a crooked smile, who lived in a shoe, for a... while...'
...so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
what future boyfriends? nono, i th- i think this could be, y'know, it.
really!
oh, yeah. I would marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know I am going to be doing that at parties, right? (does the impression)
you know what i like most about him, though?
the way he makes me feel about myself.
hi.. how was the game?
well..
fantastic! i have one question: how is that possible?
alan.
he was unbelievable. he was like that-that-that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of bugs it was first base-alan, second base-alan, third base-...
i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
can i ask you guys a question? d'you ever think that alan is maybe.. sometimes..
what?
..i dunno, a little too alan?
well, no. that is impossible. you can never be too alan.
yeah, it is his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
i personally could have a gallon of alan.
hey, lizzie.
i brought you alphabet soup.
yes. but i left in the ys. because, y'know, "sometimes y". uh, i also have something else for you. (she searches in her purse.)
no, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
i know.
no, i want you to have it. i do not want it.
oh, that is fine, no.
no. because you need that. no, it is okay, thanks.
okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we are even. okay?
okay.
no, I am fine.
huh!
a thumb?!
i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
well, maybe it is a contest, y'know? like, collect all five?
does, um, anyone want to see?
it is worse than the thumb!
hey, this is so unfair!
oh, why is it unfair?
so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking is not annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? and monica, with that snort when she laughs? i mean, what the hell is that thing? ...i accept all those flaws, why can not you accept me for this?
...does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
well, i-i could live without it.
well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?
oh, now, do not listen to him, pheebs, i think it is endearing.
oh, (imitating ross) "you do, do you"?
you know, there is nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"indeed there is not"... i should really get back to work.
yeah, because otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
ohh-ho-hooohhh. the hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
okay.. well, I am going out with a guy my friends all really like.
can you believe it? ...y'know what? i just do not feel the thing. i mean, they feel the thing, i do not feel the thing.
i know.. it is going to be really hard.
no, he will be fine. it is the other five I am worried about.
do you have any respect for your body?
do not you realise what you are-you are doing to yourself?
hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
(holding the phone out to chandler) chandler? it is alan, he wants to speak to you.
really? he does? (taking the phone) hey, buddy, what is up! oh, she told you about that, huh. well, yeah, i have one now and then. well, yeah, now. well, it is not that big- ..well, that is true,.. gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. well, okay, thanks! (he hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
(to ross, who has wandered up) god, he is good.
if only he were a woman.
yeah.
ooh, lambchop. how old is that sock? if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it would be talking too.
okay. i think it is time to change somebody is nicotine patch. (does so.)
(entering) hey. where is joey?
joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong?
i think he is across the hall.
thanks. (goes to fetch him.)
(finishing changing chandler's nicotine patch) there y'go.
(deadpan) ooh, I am alive with pleasure now.
hey pheebs, you going to have the rest of that pop-tart?.. pheebs?
does anyone want the rest of this pop-tart?
hey, i might!
sorry. ..y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
and on my way over here, i stepped in gum. ...what is up with the universe?!
(dragged in by monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) what is going on?
nothing. i just think it is nice when we are all here together.
even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
uh, joey..
oh, god! (hurriedly closes his legs.)
(turns off the tv) okay..
please, guys, we have to talk.
wait, wait, I am getting a deja vu...no, I am not.
alright, we have to talk.
there it is!
okay. it is-it is about alan. there is something that you should know. i mean, there is really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I have decided to break up with alan.
is there somebody else?
no, nononono.. it is just.. things change. people change.
we did not change..
so that is it? it is over? just like that?
you know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and i just- i- (starts chewing her hair)
look, i- i could go on pretending-
okay!
-but that would not be fair to me, it would not be fair to alan- it would not be fair to you!
who-who wants fair? y'know, i just want things back. y'know, the way they were.
I am sorry..
(sarcastic) oh, she is sorry! i feel better!
(tearful) i just can not believe this! i mean, with the holidays coming up- i wanted him to meet my family-
I will meet somone else. there will be other alans.
are you guys going to be okay?
hey hey, we will be fine. we are just going to need a little time.
(dubious) i understand.
I am, I am really sorry.
relieved?
remember when we went to central park and rented boats?.. that was fun.
yeah. he could row like a viking.
(entering) hi.
so how did it go?
oh, y'know..
did he mention us?
he said he is really going to miss you guys. (dubious look)
you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (she sits down and ross strokes her forehead.)
...that is it. I am getting cigarettes.
(leaving) i do not care, i do not care! game's over! I am weak! I have got to smoke! I have got to have the smoke!
(shouting as he leaves) if you never smoke again I will give you seven thousand dollars!
(returns) yeah, alright.
morning, roomie!
hey! you remembered to put clothes on this morning.
fifth day's a charm.
oh, joey, it is so great to be back here. i got to tell you, you are making it so easy on me and emma.
hey, it is great having you back. you know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
hey, you are not naked! so hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
well, I will probably be back to pick her up around six, but she is in the bedroom all ready to go. but she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
she is probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
bye!
bye! hey, i hope emma is not making it too hard on you.
no, hey, it is been great.
yeah?
yeah. and look, i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? and even if they were not, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
yeah, that will do it.
wow! so, how are you?
I am, I am okay.
really?
sure, i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out? of course. you know, I am disappointed, but it is not like it is a divorce.
well, actually it...
no, it is not a divorce, it is not a divorce! anyway, i think rachel and i need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
wow, really?
yeah, sure, why not? in fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
sure, i know lots of girls.
yeah? any names come to mind?
ooh, names?
hey.
hey. i was just going to get something to eat. you want something?
what you got?
goodie! thanks. so, how is it living with rachel again? i mean, apart from the great food.
I am fine, I am fine, it is just, it is just weird what is happening with her and ross. you know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
oh my god, rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too.
why are they doing this?
i do not know. they are so perfect for each other; it is crazy.
you know what is crazy? these jars. what is it, like two bites in here?
i just wish they would realise they should be together.
i know, i know. and when they moved back in together, i figured y'know, that is where things were headed.
i know. they should be a family. they should get married and have more children.
yes, and they should name one of their kids joey. i may not have kids; someone is got to carry on the family name.
you know what? maybe once they start dating, and they see what is out there, they will realise how good they are for each other.
yeah, because it is slim pickings. i had this date last night: yuck! but we should probably keep it down; she is still in the bedroom.
so, what are we going to do? are we just going to go ahead and set them up with people?
i know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
yeah. (beat) oh, i know what we can do. we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates, so that they will realise how good they are together.
ooh, that is a great plan!
yeah, you know what the best part of it is? i get to do my "plan-laugh." (a maniacal laugh follows.)
shhh! not so loud, we do not want to wake up, uh...
hey!
hey!
you guys are not doing anything tonight, are you?
see, now, why would you assume that? just because we are married? i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you will excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries.
i was just asking because i need someone to watch emma tonight.
sure, we will do that. what are you up to?
well, phoebe set me up on a date.
oh my god.
wow.
why? what is the big deal?
just figured, because you and ross are...
what, slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, I am all set.
well, i think it is great that you are going on a date, you know? i mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood!
you want a job? turn off "oprah," and send out a resume!
so I will bring her by around seven? is that okay?
oh, it is perfect.
oh, you guys are going to have so much fun! she is at such a cute age. oh, a couple things. now that she is eating solid food, she poops around the clock. and watch out for your hair, because she likes to grab it. and oh, she is also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... thanks, you guys. have fun!
ooh, joey.
hey.
hey. I am so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight.
all right! who is he?
well, it is this guy i used to massage. and by massage, i mean hold down so he would not turn over and flash me.
oh, yeah.
she is this really boring woman. she is a teacher!
a teacher?
yeah, yeah, she is really into history and foreign movies... and oh, oh, she loves puzzles. huh? come on, who loves puzzles?
well, ross does. what... you are - you are ruining the plan! joey, you have - you have fixed him up with his perfect woman!
oh my god, you are right!
yeah.
she even reads for pleasure!
how do you even know a woman like that?
what? I am not allowed to know smart women?
joey.
i met her at the library. i went in to pee.
so now what do we do?
well, okay, I will - I will just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
what if we do not find him somebody else? we will just tell her the date's off, but we do not tell ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
ooh...i hear that is bad.
ooh, so this is great! rachel's going to have a terrible date, ross gets stood up, and then they will realise how good they have it together.
ah, yes, the plan! (laughs loudly again, but he sounds more like santa claus.)
it is not santa's plan. no, it is... (laughs the real "plan-laugh.")
yeah, you know, it is not that fun.
no, i think we killed it.
emma? emma? look at me! well, i think I will go downstairs for a while.
no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it is okay, it is okay. i did not go. do not cry, it is just a bit! I am your uncle chandler; funny is all i have!
okay, just so you know, I am going to be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so do not touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
i do not do that.
I will try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth?
yeah.
today is the sixth.
no, it is not.
yes, it is also 2003.
oh my god. today's the sixth?! i may be done ovulating! i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
it is okay. go take the test and see if we are okay.
okay.
tough crib.
hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? there is only one here.
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times.
chandler!
i am not working. there is not much to do around here!
excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
well, if I am still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
nah, i do not know if i should. i do not want to be drunk when i go home alone.
yeah, it is no big deal. it is just a blind date.
no!
we are okay. I am still ovulating.
oh, good, because as of four of the clock this afternoon, i am not.
so, let us do this.
i - i do not think i can.
come on. i know you are not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
because of emma.
oh my god, emma. oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here. oh, you are right, we can not do this. we can not leave her alone.
sorry.
unless... maybe we do it here. i mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
well, she is aware when we leave the room. she may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
canoodling?
well, i can not say "hump" or "screw" in front of the b-a-b-y.
i do not know. i mean, i guess having sex in front of a baby is not so...
horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for?
i guess you are right.
you guess I am right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you would not have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
wow, everything looks so good! i think I am going to have the chicken.
oh, well, that is - that is very sweet. thank you.
what?
well, come on, steve; let us not rule out nervous laughter. hey, now wait a minute. phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. that is impressive.
really? what is that like?
really?
hello?
phoebe, it is me. I am going to hunt you down and kill you!
hey, rach!
this is the worst date ever. how could you set me up with this creep?
you know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
i do not care! this guy is a nightmare!
oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he is stoned.
he is not stoned.
did he go out for a cigarette?
yeah, four times.
my dear, sweet rach.
oh, great, pretty soon they will be back together.
by the time anyone's figured out what we have done, we will be in sunny mexico. (beat) oh, wait, that is the end of a different plan.
she is asleep. chandler?
what are you doing?
emma was doing it!
she is asleep.
ooh, she is asleep, that means we can...
yes, but we have to be fast.
hello?
emma? hey! hi!
how are ya? how are ya? where are your babysitters, huh? why is the bedroom door closed?
you can not have s-e-x, when you are taking care of the b-a-b-i-e!
eh, if it was meant to be, it is meant to be.
wow, free crab cakes. well, that is nice. although i was hoping to have sex tonight.
just the crab cakes.
what is - what is going on?
what? you - you are making money off my misery?
this is unbelievable. i - i have never been so insulted in my life. now, if you will wrap up my free crab cakes, I will be on my way.
well, that was weird. you were loud, and i was fast.
i think we may have really done it this time.
oh, i wish i did not have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
you may want to get some more of those too.
where is emma?
oh my god, where is emma? where is emma?
do not ask me, i was in there canoodling you!
okay, okay, I am sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma. you go look across the hall, and I will call her cell.
okay. (runs out.)
hey, you better hope that we are pregnant, because one way or another, we are giving a baby back to rachel.
no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry.
do not touch my coat!
oh, sorry, it is my phone. hello?
oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
hey, did you stop by here?
no.
oh my god, then...
oh, thank god! emma, there you are!
what? what do you mean, "there you are"? where was she?
oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." she just � she loves it when I am dramatic.
because you two were having sex!
no, we were not!
do not you lie to me! i could tell by chandler's hair. (to chandler.) you are so lazy. can not you get on top for once?
all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating.
hey! it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room. I am going to have to tell rachel about this.
no, no, no.
no, please do not. please, joey. she will kill us!
hey, i got to! unless...
unless what?
unless you name your firstborn child joey.
what? why?
hey, i may never have kids, and somebody is got to carry on my family name.
your family name is tribbiani.
(beat) (laughs.) you almost had me.
well, uh...
really, really not.
all right, well that is good to know. good night, steve.
hey, what is wrong?
i just had a rough night.
oh. crab cake?
eww!
well, what happened?
oh, well, i...it is kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
monica told me you had a blind date.
yeah.
i did, too.
oh.
but is it technically a date if the other person does not show up?
oh, oh no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
why does everyone keep saying that?
well, if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date had not shown up.
that bad?
well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
female body inspector? what size is that?
now, wait a minute. so, they are going to name their first child joey?
uh-huh.
how - how do i get them to name the next one after me?
it is easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
oh, so they owe me like, three phoebes.
oh my god! look, it is ross and rachel. oh, the plan is working.
do not, do not do the plan-laugh.
the first date we have had in months, and they were both such disasters.
oh. huh. you know, it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that did not even show.
wait a minute; you do not think it was intentional? i mean, that is just stupid.
we are geniuses! yeah, look at them, look at them, they are really bonding.
oh, yeah, they are falling in love all over again.
oh, they see us! oh, they, they look mad. oh, they figured it out. they are coming this way. run!
where?
mexico!
can you believe they are still not here?
i know. a double blind date, and we both get stood up. what are the chances?
i know, I am so bummed. can we have our free crab cakes now?
we have been stood up. (sniffles) and we want our free crab cakes.
are you looking at naked tribe's women?
no, look. (shows him the magazine.)
that is a pig.
i know, i know, but look at the knobs on her.
hey! (joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
emily's cousin kicked me out!
what?!
why?
well, when you are subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
how can he do that? did not you sign a lease?
who needs a lease when it is family!
hey, you can stay with us! we will take care of ya!
oh, yeah! absolutely! anything you need man! but you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
yeah.
you got it.
okay.
thanks you guys, i really appreciate this. all right, I am going to get packing again. man, I have been moving around so much I am beginning to feel like a nomad.
what?
he thought you said gonad.
oh, larry.
umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
it is okay to laugh right?
okay. (she laughs harder.)
okay, knock yourself out, larry.
yum-my!
larry?
oh yeah! I would let him check out my kitchen floors.
uh, look, larry honey, umm, i wrote the book on section 5 and i know that you do not have to wear your hat unless you are in the kitchen.
it is in the kitchen, I will go get it.
hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (to larry) wow! you saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she would have to go in there hatless to get it. you can have your own health inspector detective show!
yeah, but then i can be you sidekick vunda.
okay, she would love that! y'know, because you know all the clean places to eat.
okay.
he is so funny! (she imitates what he just did.)
thanks.
thank you. (to monica) mon?
hmm?
how is ross doing? y'know since all the emily stuff.
he is not great umm, but he is dealing with it. oh wait a minute, you are not going to try…
oh, honey, please, no, i can not get started with all that ross stuff again. i mean, he is going to screwed up for a looong time. and besides y'know, i do not, i do not go for guys right after they get divorced.
right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
(to monica) danny. are you guys ever going to go out again?
i do not know! he has not called me since that one time when we went out. i see him in the hallway, we flirt, I am all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
hi danny! (notices his box of liquor he is carrying.) wow! thirsty huh?
ohh, fun!
ohh, great!
yeah.
well, i guess we will not be warming his house.
(laughs) okay. all right, i see what he is doing! he is not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
and you are not going to do that.
that is right! because that would give him the control! so now he is all ooh, coming up with this whole I have got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. blew up in his face, did not it?
so-so there is no party.
no, there is a party. there is a party. but the power, that is still up for grabs. you follow me?
i think so. se, he-he is not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
exactly.
ross?
(entering from the bathroom) hey roomies!
love what you have done with the place.
oh, yeah i know, i know, it is a lot of boxes, but again i really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
not a problem. and listen, hey! since you are going to be here for a while, why do not—i was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
oh yeah!
oh, i uh, hope you do not mind, i kind of uh, jazzed it up a little. check this out. (he plays the greeting, and we will rock you starts to play and ross's voice comes over it.) we will, we will, call you back!
hey, all right!
pretty cool, huh?
(to chandler) you are fake laughing too, right?
oh, the tears are real.
(smiles) show me the badge again.
shiny.
(laughing) you are just nonstop!
why?!
(awed) you have the power to do that?
(excited) shut it down.
hey.
what are you doing?
nothing.
you built a fort did not ya?
(smiles) kind of.
(notices something) oh my god, the air purifier! ross's air purifier! all i heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
dude, you should have gone out once and a while.
i hate this thing!
come on, chandler, ross is our friend. he needs us right now, so why do not you be a grown up and come and watch some tv in the fort!
oh, hi danny.
oh, thanks! we will try to stop by.
uh, actually, i think I am going to be busy.
you are?
yeah! remember i got that uh, gala.
it is a uh, regatta gala.
no-no, but i support it.
okay.
okay. (closes the door.) walked right into that one did not he?
what one? you wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
yeah, but he waited until the last minute! so if i said yes, he would know i had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. i said, "no!" which puts me right back in the driver seat.
great. so the ball is in his court?
ball? there is no ball.
(glaring at him) joey, please! (motions to his computer.)
sorry.
ahhhhhhhhhh…
(entering) hello children!
hey! want to play some foosball? please?
okay. (starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
no-no, no! we have to move the table into my room, yeah! because of all the boxes. come on!
all right, i have one question. what is the deal with this? (imitates ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he is waving good-bye.)
bye-bye little puppet joey hand?
no, the quiet down thing!
you mean this. (does the maneuver perfectly.)
um-hmm! look, i-i-i do not know how much more of this i can take! did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with some show about bugs! my god! what if that had been porn?
(gasps) all right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is ross! i survived college with him!
all right, i guess i can hold out a little longer. let us have a game.
okay.
no-no-no-no!
yes!!
(entering) uh fellas, (does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which chandler returns as he closes the door.)
okay, so he is out of here.
um-hmm.
(entering) hey!
hey!
you guys got anything to eat? i just went down to johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
oh, i took larry there to eat but it was all violated. so we shut it down!
pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we going to eat?!
i do not know, clean places?
umm, yum!
(looking through the peephole) it is danny.
do not let him in! I am supposed to be at a regatta gala.
(to danny) we will be right there! (to rachel) can not you just say it starts later?
what? what kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
the fake kind!
we have a ladle. (gives him one.)
okay, great!
hey, guys, you know what larry would say? he would say, "see you ladle." (laughs.)
well, i-i-I am done with this. you want anything ross? sports? international? apartment listings?
I will take sports.
mine! (he grabs it.)
all right. uhh, international.
oh that is mine too! (grabs it and ross looks at him.) I am italian!
well, i guess i can check out those apartment listings, even though there is never anything in here.
not even on page 7?
(looks) oh yeah! you are—hey, you are right! here is an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it is available in five weeks!
what about that circled one?
oh, i-i do not know, it is kind of expensive for a studio.
but it is available now! is not it?
yes, it is.
hey, let us go look at it! (they both jump up.)
okay, let us go.
okay!
there we go!
oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, i was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? i mean after all, we all are using it.
let us go quicker.
yeah!
oh my god! (looking around, which does not take him long.)
yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. well that is great! y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
somebody was using his head. hey, let us check out the rest of the place.
i think this is it. i do not know, maybe we should keep looking.
but hey, ross, this place is available now!
yeah, you do not want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
yeah.
(to joey) so, you-you think i should go ahead and take this place?
oh, it is perfect!
(to chandler) how about you?
it is a kitchen slash bathroom.
all right, i see what you guys are saying. I will uh, I will go downstairs and fill out an application.
we are bad people.
he knew we were trying to get rid of him. he knew! (pause.) you think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
ooh, absolutely!
ooh, i love that place! (thinks about it.) so, no.
enh. sure!
oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! that—this milk is mine. i bought this today, because i was thirsty for milk, y'know. (she takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) okay, let us go!
okay, stop! larry, okay, can not you just be larry and not larry the health inspector guy? y'know i mean it was really exciting at first but now it is like, okay, so where are we going to eat ever?
thank you. (to gunther, who is standing there frozen) okay, go! go! go! (he runs off.) (to larry) now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, i know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping ross get back on his feet!
yes that was a nice place!
yeah!
not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
yeah!
what are we going to do?
i do not know. maybe pizza?
about ross!
oh! oh!
hello! (listens.) oh yeah! (to chandler) it is the apartment manager; ross put us down as references. (to the apartment manager.) ross is the greatest guy you will ever meet! yeah, he is very reliable.
(grabbing the phone) of course he has this big huge dog! that uh, barks into the night. (listens.) well, who does not love dogs? (thinks.) ah, he is a tap dancer! (listens.) yes, some would say that is a lost art. (thinks.) he is a pimp! (listens.) there you go! yes, he is a pimp. he is a big, tap dancing pimp! (pause.) hello?
ohhhhh!
shoot, shoot, this is never going to work! he is right there!
just go over and say hi.
no, i have to go downstairs and come back up as if I am coming home from the regatta gala. okay? so just go distract him. but do not be sexy.
hey, danny!
(turns his back to the stairs) oh, it is a great party! great food. y'know, most parties it is all chips and salsa, chips and salsa. (as she is saying this rachel tries to head downstairs but is blocked by people coming upstairs. she quickly retreats back up the stairs.) (sees that she has to keep him distracted longer.) so umm, what is this? (points to his plate.)
ooooh! (rachel now succeeds in getting downstairs.) and-and-and what-what is this? (points again.)
(upon seeing rachel she points) oh.
hey! oh right, tonight was your party.
oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.
yeah, sure. (to monica) all right, whose court is the ball in now?
i thought there was not a ball?
oh, come on! he is glad that i came, he does not want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!
oh, go on! you telling people about me?
(laughs) yeah, okay, at ease solider!
no, it is all right, you can just drop the act tommy. i know what is going on here. your danny's wingman right? you guys are best buds. frat bros!
yeah, yeah, you go talk to your friend. you tell him, "nice try."
man! he just keeps lobbing them up and i just keep knocking them right out of the park!
i think i need a drink.
yeah!
98. 99. 100. okay, go!
(getting up) dude, I am telling ya! I am fine! (he tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)
here we go! here we go!
hey!
hey!
hey. so i uh, i did not get that apartment. some problem with my application.
you are kidding!
you are kidding, no!
yeah. but, the good news is that phoebe said that i could stay at her place for a while. so…
but you can not stay with phoebe, ross! we are-we are roomies!
look, you guys do not need me here taking up your space.
well, we got plenty of space! there-there is still some over there (points to where the window is but sees that there is not any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. please, just stay!
yeah!
are you guys sure about this?
definitely!
yes! ross, you have to stay!
all right.
all right!
all right, buddy!
so I am a pimp huh? it is okay! look, i know that sometimes i can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. tell me if something is bothering you. okay? and for my part i will do everything i can to keep my annoying habits just (does the 'quiet down' maneuver).
well, i see you have had a very productive day. do not you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
(popping up behind joey wearing an indian headdress) come on, it is fun!
all right! (he joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) is not this a woman's hat?
dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
(entering from her bedroom carrying a present) ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and i know he is going to grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but i could not resist. (there a little pair of nike shoes.)
oh, look at these! hey, ben. just do it. (ben starts to cry) oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
you know, it is... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I will be right back. (goes into the kitchen)
(joins him) i got to get one, too.
(following them into the kitchen) what are you guys doing?
we are just hanging out by the spoons. ladle?
look, would you guys grow up? that is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
yeah, we know, but there is a baby suckin' on it.
this is my son having lunch, ok? it is going to happen a lot, so you would better get used to it. now if you have any problem with it, if you are uncomfortable, just ask questions. carol's fine with it, now come on.
carol?
carol? i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
uh, does it hurt?
chandler?
so, uh, how often can you do it?
ok, i got one, i got one. uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
yeah, i forget which ones.
(to julie) thank you. (under her breath to chandler) what a bitch.
i can not, i have to take my grandmother to the vet.
ok, um, I will go with you.
(enters) hi, honey.
hey, sweetums.
hello to the rest.
monica what are you doing? you can not go shopping with her? what about rachel?

come on, you are going to bloomingdale's with julie? that is like cheating on rachel in her house of worship.
but I am...
monica, she will kill you. she will kill you like a dog in the street.
(to monica) so, uh, jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
yeah, uh, it is actually not that big a deal.
it is a big deal to me. this is great, monica. i really appreciate this.

we were shopping, and we had lunch.
oh, all right. what did i have?

um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
you went shopping for fur?

(monica is yanking on her bra strap) bras! we bought bras! we bought bras.
(to a guy) bijan for men? (to a guy) bijan for men? (to a woman) bijan for... (sees it is a woman and stops.) (to annabelle who walks up.) hey, annabelle, uh, listen, i was wondering if maybe after work you and i could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
(to a co-worker) hey, it is not the first time i lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. (a customer walks by.) bijan for men? (the customer ignores him, and joey starts to chase him) bijan for men?!
carol, we have been through this before, ok? we have a good time. we laugh, we play. it is like we are father and son.
oh, this is so cute.
my mommies love me. that is clever.
hello? oh, hi, ju—(sees rachel is watching)—hi, jew! (walks into the kitchen.) (listens.) uh huh? (listens.) uh huh? (listens) ok. (listens) um, sure, that would be great. see ya then. bye. (hangs up.)
did you just say hi, jew?
yes. uh, yes, i did. that was my friend, eddie moskowitz. yeah, he likes it. reaffirms his faith.
ben, dinner!
thanks aunt pheebs. hey, you did not microwave that, did you, because it is breast milk, and you are not supposed to do that.
duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. ok. (squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)
what did you just do?
i licked my arm, what?
it is breast milk.
so?
phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
what is the big deal? (tastes the breast milk.)
what did you just do?
ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
you will not even taste it?
no!
not even if you just pretend that it is milk?
not even if carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
hey, where is everybody?
they took ben to the park. where have you been?
just out. had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. thanks for your jacket.
oh, no problem. you can borrow it, by the way. (puts her hand in the pocket) here are your keys, hon. (she takes the keys out, sets them on the counter, and notices she also grabbed a receipt.)
okay.
mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
you know what probably happened? someone musta stolen my credit card.
and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
that is an excellent excellent question. that is excellent.
monica, what is with you? who would you have lunch with?
judy.
who?
julie.
what?!
jody!
you were with julie?
look, when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. and then, one thing led to another and, before i knew it, we were...shopping.
oh. oh my god.
honey, wait. we only did it once. it did not mean anything to me.
yeah, right.  sure!
really, rachel, i was thinking of you the whole time. look, I am sorry, all right. i never meant for you to find out!
oh, please, you wanted to get caught. (waves the receipt)
that is not true!
oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid?
ok, monica. i just have to know one thing. did you go with her to bloomingdale's? (monica looks away.) oh! ok, ok, ok, i just really, uh, i just really need to not be with you right now. (exits.)
(on the phone) hi, who is this? (listens) hi, joanne. is rachel working? it is monica. (listens) yes, i know i did a horrible thing. (listens) joanne, it is not as simple as all that, ok? (listens) no, i do not care what steve thinks. (listens) hi, steve.
oh, i tasted ben's milk, and ross freaked out.
i did not freak out.
because it is breast milk. it is gross.
no, no, carol. there is nothing wrong with it. i just, i just do not think breast milk is for adults.
of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
(jumping away) that would be no.
come on. it does not taste bad.
yeah, it is kind of sweet, sorta like, uh...
exactly.
(staring at susan) you have tasted it? you have tasted it.
oh, you have tasted it.
(he rolls up his sleeve) give me the bottle. (joey hands him the bottle and ross squirts some on his arm.) give me the towel. (joey gives him the towel and he wipes it off.)
how do you.
(sitting on the otherside of the counter from chandler) give me a box a juice. well, they switched me over to hombre.
well, maybe it is because of the way you are dressed.
or maybe it is because this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it. (chandler pours some juice in a glass.) you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
(slides the juice across the counter which joey catches) what do you care? you are an actor. this is your day job. this is not supposed to mean anything to you.
i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best. (he downs the glass of juice in one swig.) i do not know. maybe i should just get outta the game. they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
(pours more and slides the refill to joey) all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody is going to come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where are you going to run?
yeah i guess you are right.
you are damn right I am right. i say you show this guy what you are made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I am going to do it. (he downs the juice in one swig again.)
all right. now go see miss kitty and she will fix you up with a nice hooker.
i do not know what else to say.
well that works out good, because I am not listening.
i feel terrible, i really do.
oh, I am sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
rachel, (they go back inside) say that I am friends with her, we spend some time together. is that so terrible?
yes.
it is that terrible?
yes. monica, you do not get it. it is bad enough that she is stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with, but now, she is actually (starting to cry), but now she is actually stealing you.
me? what are you talking about? nobody could steal me from you. i mean, just because I am friends with her does not make me any less friends with you. i mean, (starting to cry) you are my...we are, we are...oh, i love you.
i love you too. (they hug.)
you guys, um i know that this really does not have anything to do with me, but um i love you guys too. (joins in on the hug.) oh, i really needed that. (goes and sits down.)
look, i know that you are in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts, but she did not do anything wrong. i mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. i really think that if you gave her a chance, you would like her. would you just give that a chance, for me?
(crying) I would do anything for you, you know that.
(crying) I would do anything for you. (they hug again.)
wait, wait, wait, wait! (runs over and joins in on the hug again.)
mornin'. (the hombre man ignores him) i said, mornin'.
yeah, I am ready.
these new kids, they never last. sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now?
so. i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. i mean, you know, we have never really talked. i guess you would know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
really? me?
well, you are not totally paranoid.
um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I am not going to bore you with now, but um, i just, i see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god i hate it when she is right.
yeah, that would be great. I would love it.
all right, julie.
bye. (after julie exits.) what a manipulative bitch.
(with a mouthful) that is not bad.
(opens the door wearing a robe, but leaves the chain on) hey, what is up?
well, i left my guitar here again.
oh, okay. no problem.
okay. (monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)
okay.
oh.
here you go.
okay.
okay.
great! umm…(monica closes the door again and phoebe knocks again.)
what?!
so do you want to hang out or something?
phoebe! you kind of caught me at a bad time.
oh are you and chandler…
yes! exactly.
okay. do you guys want me to play for you?
(laughs) no. (closes the door as chandler walks up.)
hey pheebs, what is up?
you ask an intriguing question chandler bing.
oh my god! you are getting a massage! you never let me massage you!!
phoebe, i can explain!
you told me you hate massages!
buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…do not let phoebe in.
i can not believe this! how long as this been going on?
well umm, alexandra has been…
oh, it has a name?
phoebe, do not get upset!
okay—oop! too late! I am leaving! come on chandler let us go! (she storms out.)
well, phoebe i thought I would—(off phoebe’s look)—yeah, what the hell. (exits with phoebe.)
oh okay, okay! one more push! one more push! come on honey, we are almost there! we are almost there!
oh joey, I am so happy things worked out for us that we are having this baby together. i love you so much.
oh, i love you too.
and i hope it is not an inappropriate time to say this but, you are the best sex i ever had.
that is always appropriate! (back to the matter at hand) oh, okay. one more push! one more push!
(crying) i hope you are a better father than you are a friend!! (cries again and joey wakes up in horror.)
(bursts into the room) joey! joey!
what? what is going on?
come feel this! come feel my belly!
aaaah…
joey! the baby is kicking for the first time! will you please come feel this?!
really?!
yes!
oh, y’know what? maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I am a not, I am not wearing any bottoms.
oh, okay! (she goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
oh my, oh my god!
aw, it is unbelievable! wow! she is kicking so much! oh, she is like umm…oh…who is that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
mia hamm?
mia hamm!
oh that is amazing. (drops the sheet.)
(looking down) oh-oh!! one hand on the sheet joe!
whoa-hey-oh! sorry!
hey babe.
hi honey. we just got a wedding gift from bob and faye bing; they do not like us do they? (they gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)
who says you can not get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? maybe we can take it back?
no, it does not say where it came from. where would we return it?
how about to the street say from the balcony?
why do not we just find a place for it?
okay. how about in that cabinet?
no! that is where we keep the canned goods! have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
how about the closet by the bathroom? (the secret green door by the bathroom.)
oh, okay. here, why do not you let me do it?
oh no-no-no, i will do it. honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (tries the door.) it is locked, you have to help me. why is it locked?
no reason. i-i keep private things in there.
oh y’know, I have been living here a while and I have never seen what is inside that closet. what is, what is in there?
feminine stuff.
do not try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! if you love me you-you will let it go.
fine.
thank you! (he tries the door again and monica glares at him.)
(walking casually away) love you.
(entering) hello chandler, lovely day huh? (to monica) you!
phoebe if it helps alexandra has only been massaging monica for like three years. (phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and monica glares at him.) if! i said, "if it helps!" (goes to the bedroom.)
why will not you let me massage you?
well it is…i mean I would just—I would be self-conscious. you are my friend; I would be naked.
monica! we lived together for years! I have seen you naked!
that is different, we were roommates! and when?!
I am curious about the human body.
hey, come on phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
but I am a professional! and I am really good! look, if you are uncomfortable we can stop. just give me a chance, okay. please?
okay, if it means that much to you…
it does! how would you feel if you could not share your cooking? or-or imagine how ross would feel if he could not teach us about dragons.
dinosaurs.
potato, potaato.
hey!
hey ross! the baby’s kicking!
what?! it is?! (he tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs rachel’s belly.)
it is not kicking right now. although we would love to see you do (mimics him) that again.
hey, when-when was it kicking? what happened?
last night! i just felt it and i went into joey’s room and he was sleeping…
a dreamless sleep.
my god, the baby’s kicking. that is great. although i…kind of wish i-i would have been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.
well i got stuff going on in here (rubbing his belly) if you want to feel.
look, i-i do not want to miss anymore baby stuff. so…here. here is my new pager number, okay? anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I will be there! okay? i do not care if it is three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
wow! can i get a copy of that?
(calling from her room) are you under the sheet?
yes.
(in a soothing voice) great, let us begin. (she starts the massage.) how is the pressure?
nice! wow phoebe you are good!
stating the obvious, but thank you. and it is not weird is it.
no. ooohh…
that is right, you just enjoy.
(in a sexy voice) oh. oh yeah! ohhhhh! ohh! oh yeah!
(getting uncomfortable) okay.
oh god phoebe!! (phoebe covers one ear.) oh that is it! that is it! right there! oh! (tries to cover the other ear.) ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)
i was not trying to open your closet! i was not trying to open your closet! i swear! (running into the kitchen and sees its joey.)
whoa, monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. what are you doing?
monica has a secret closet and she will not let me see what is in it.
why not?
i do not know! what could she possibly be hiding in here that i can not see?!
i do not know. ooh, i bet it is richard.
why would monica be keeping richard in here?
well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she is having her cake and eating it too. you being the cake and richard being the too. or!
and here we go…
i saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. y’know it would not kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy! (he walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.) stupid closet full of bugs!
joey. joey, something feels weird and not good weird. i do not—whoa!! (winces in pain.)
oh hey whoa-whoa, do not worry. okay. when my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
really?
absolutely. but, we are going to stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I will page ross on the way. come on.
okay. oh god—ow!—oo!
okay rach-rach-rach look at me, look at me, everything’s going to be fine, trust me. okay. take my hand. here we go. (rachel grabs his hand.) oww crushing bones!
hey! so?
hmm, mild discomfort. so i take it you have had one of these braxton thingies?
so but everything is normal.
and-and there is no danger to her and the baby?
thank you doctor. (dr. long exits.) (to joey) oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
calm?! i was not calm! I have never been more scared in all my life!
but wait you said everything was going to be okay.
well what do i know?! I am not a doctor!
but i—but everything is okay. I am fine!
you sure?!
yes! yes! i got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. mild discomfort, what is he talking about?
(seeing ross) oh hey-hey!
(rushes in) is everything okay?
yeah, everything’s fine!
your page said come to the hospital, what? what was it? what happened?
something called braxton-hicks contractions.
oh. oh. thank god, most women do not even feel them.
okay, no uterus, no opinion.
hey uh, what is with the candy?
oh when you beeped me i was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
oh you went to the movies by yourself?
no i—mona!
oh, i got to go back in there.
what? why? what is wrong?
no, everything’s fine. i just got to go back…
no really, you tell me what is up.
i-i forgot my underwear. (ross let us her go.)
(to joey) so, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
oh hey, do not worry about it man. do not worry about it, no big deal.
yeah but still, i mean it should have been me. I am the dad.
oh uh, hey. not as good as this guy! (grabs ross around the shoulders.) he brought twizlers!
there has got to be a way!
easy there captain kirk. oh, do you have a bobby pin?
yeah. (checks his hair.) oh no wait, I am not an nine-year-old girl.
then why do you throw like one?
maybe monica has a bobby pin.
sure. "monica."
so, how is the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming?
uh, really good. really good. yeah, i should be ready to kill myself any day now. (chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to joey.) wow, you sure found that quick. (he tries the pin in the lock.) i just—i wish i did not feel this way about rachel anymore, y’know? i wish things could go back to normal. i mean, i love living with her and god, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now i think…i think ross feels left out. y’know? when i had to take rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought i was the father. god… you should have seen the look on ross’s face. (pause) by the way, i have no idea what I am doing here. for all i know I am just locking it more. oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
that is a good idea.
yeah.
okay. (they switch places and chandler gets out a credit card.) so uh, ross is kind of bummed huh?
oh, i just…i feel terrible.
well, it is not your fault. what are you going to do? not take her to the hospital? y’know? you are doing nothing wrong. (pause) except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (he loses his card behind the door.) richard? if-if you are in there, could you pass me my credit card?
hey.
hey.
i got to tell you, yesterday was amazing. that massage felt so good!
no-no, i got that.
so umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
okay. okay but you should know though, I have raised my rates to $200 an hour.
okay.
i mean $500.
what?
600.
what is going on?
oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
what? (laughs.)
yeah, and it really freaked me out! and after a while i even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
what?! you are crazy! there is nothing sexual about the noises i make!
really? there is nothing sexual about this? (sexily) oooh. oo god! ohh. ohhhh. ohh. (some cute guy is watching closely.) (to him) what are you looking at?! (pause) i mean hi.
oh my—this is so embarrassing. oh my god, I am never going to get massaged again!
no, you can not let this stop you from getting massages! no look, i have, i have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
really?!
well not clients, lovers. but let us just y’know, try it again. come back and-and we will work through it.
are you sure?
yes.
i guess.
great! okay, if you will just excuse me. (to the guy) so, did you hear something you liked?
hey ross! check it out! i learned a new trick!
hey uh, i brought you some lunch.
ohh! that is so sweet of you! oh yum! (takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) did you put pickles on this?
well yeah!
oh ross!! (runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
what?! what?! rach what?!
what is going on?
i made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
pickle? pickles make her sick. giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
(to rachel) i-I am sorry rach, i did not know. are you going to be okay?
yeah, I will be fine. but could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when i get out there?
I am on it! (takes a bite out of the sandwich.)
i can not believe this! i should not be the one making her throw up!
dude relax! it could happen to anyone.
yeah? not to you, because you know this stuff. i do not know any of it and I am the father. i wish I would be more involved y’know.
(entering) well, if anyone is keeping score, i no longer eat tuna.
hey uh, can i, can i talk to you guys for a second?
yeah.
what is up?
uh, sit down. i want to talk about our situation.
(gasps) are you breaking up with us?
the thing is…because i live with rachel I am here for a lot of the stuff, okay? (to rachel) and ross…ross is missing everything. so…
yeah?
maybe you two should live together.
are you asking me to move out? do you not want me here?
oh no-no, no-no i love living with you. it just seems that…if you are going to have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.
but joey, i do not think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. i mean—(ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—or he does.
no i-i-i would love to be around for you and the baby. and we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
but ross, its you and me!
so? sure! but it-it would not be anything romantic. and I am-I am dating mona—damnit mona! i was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! what is wrong with me?!
all right now, so? what do you think?
i do not know. is it crazy?
no! no it is not. joey, this is a smart idea.
well, i was due.
okay, let us do it. I will move in.
really?
yeah.
oh rach that is great. that is great. (they hug and joey breathes a sigh of relief.)
not to shabby, i got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (he takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what is behind the green door! it is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) oh my god!
(entering) (gasps) how did you get in there?!
(laughs) you are messy.
oh no! you were not supposed to see this!
i married fred sanford!
no chandler, you do not understand! (chandler starts singing the theme for sanford and son, an old tv show starring redd fox.) okay! okay! okay! fine! now you know. okay? I am y’know…I am sick.
no, honey you are not sick! look, i do not love you because you are organized, i love you in spite of that.
really? you promise you will not tell anyone?
yes! and look, now that i know if i got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
well…it is just umm…I am afraid you might mess it up.
hey.
hey.
so rachel’s all moved out huh? how are you taking it?
well uh, i wanted to have a few beers, but uh, i got rid of those because rachel could not stand the smell of them. but i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. and uh, it is a couple weeks past it is expiration date, so it is got a bit of a kick.
are you okay?
are you kidding me? I am great! yeah, I am uh; I am better than great. i am good. and now that she is gone, i can uh, i can do all this stuff around here that i could not do before. y’know? like umm, i can walk around naked again. y’know? i can uh, i can watch porn in the living room. right? this is uh, this is good for me. y’know? i like being on my own, I am uh, better off this way. I am uh, a lone wolf. y’know? a loner. alone. all alone. forever. what is a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (chandler rushes over and hugs him.)
ohhh.
that is it. just relax.
ohh. oh! ohh!
come on more!
oh god!
yeah, you like that do not you?
oh yeah right there!
you want it there? you take it there baby!
uh phoebe?
yeah, say my name. say it! (she stops when she realizes what she is doing.) and now I am going to cover you back up, and umm we are never doing this again.
okay, pick a card, any card. (monica picks one) all right, now memorize it. show to everybody. got it?
um-mm.
all right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.
real magic does exist.
wow.
wow. joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?
i can not tell you that, no.
ah, somebody is at the door on the ceiling.
noo, that is our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
he took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
why do not you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’
i have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that i go up there to yell and then i end up apologizing to him.
ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I will go up there, I will tell him to keep it down.
all right, be my guest.
good luck.
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really want to know how i did it, I will show ya. when you handed me back the card, what you did not see was, i looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) i just did it. (does it again) i just did it, again. here, I will slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)
(muffled through the floor) yeah, look i was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and i am sick and tired... (i tired but the rest is unintelligible).
(muffled) oh, thank you.
(entering) hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
honey, what is the matter?
i just saw janice.
yeah, she was at rockefeller center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. i almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.
man, i remember the first time i saw that girl katherine, after we broke up. she was just walking with her friend donna, just laughing and talking. god, it killed me.
yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
sorry, i just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
hey chandler, there is a party tomorrow, you will feel better then.
oh, y'know what, I am going to be okay, you do not have to throw a party for me.
it is joey’s birthday.
oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
sush!! i cannot believe she is still up there.
okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. y'know, it is supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
(jumping up from reading her magazine) yeah, right away mr. kaplan.
i know!
op.
oh, you got me.
oh, that sounds great.
oh thank you so much mr. kaplan, thank you so much.
oh god, i hate my job, i hate it, i hate my job, i hate it.
i know honey, I am sorry.
oh, i want to quit, but then i think i should stick it out, then i think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it is remotely related to the field they are interested in.
(gives her a look) gee, i do not know rach. order up!! i got a yentel soup, a james beans, and a how do you hold the dowdy!
oh honey, come on, I am sorry, i did not.... i do not mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am i going to learn about fashion by walking mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
(to him) hi! is my misery amusing to you?
it is not funny, this is actually my job.
oh well then, so I am just going to go back to talking to my friend here. and you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
yes?!
(looks at monica) (to him) do you want my pickle?
hey gunther. hi. (to phoebe) i mean you are going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
well, he is very charming.
i know, he is too charming, but if you two start going out, then it is just going to make it so much harder for me to hate him.
well, you are just going to have to try.
joey, where are the jell-of shots?
i do not know, chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘them around...
chandler!
hello-dillillio!!
oh, somebody is feeling better.
(to chandler) stick out your tongue.
(to monica) take off your shirt!
oh my!!
oh my god! how many of these things did you have? these are pure vodka.
yeah, jell-of just like mom used to make.
(entering, to ross) the most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
hi!
hi! so I am out having lunch at monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. so i gave him my phone number and he is going to call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
wow!
i know!
what, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
uh-huh!
and he is, he is a total stranger?
yeah! his name is um, mark something.
huh. sounds like mark something wants to have some sex.
what!?
well, I am just saying, i mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
to be nice.
hey, joey. are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
no, only for sex.
thank you. (to rachel) so did you ah, did you tell mark something about me?
i did not have to, because i was wearing my ‘i heart ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.
uh-huh.
hey!! hey-hey-hey!
(to monica) okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
how hammered are you? huh? these, these are joey’s sisters.
hi joey’s sisters!
(to one of his sisters, cookie) hey!
well, i have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
wow. okay, i do not know how to talk to you.
oh, I am taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
no-no-no-no, no, it is a good thing. why must we dial so speedily anyway? why must we rush through life? why can not we savor the precious moments? (to one of joey’s sisters) those are some huge breasts you have.
hi.
hi.
yeah. so um, i-i heard about this ah, mark guy that ah, rachel met today.
is not that great?
oh yeah! so ah, kind of pretty, pretty good. he sounds like a nice, good guy.
oh, he is. and he is so dreamy. i mean, y'know what, when he left i actually used the phrase, ‘hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)
that is excellent.
(to rachel) so, he is just a nice guy. you really think this mark does not want anything in exchange for helping him?
well, i assume I will have to take showers with him, but y'know, that is true of any job.
how ya feelin’?
well, my apartment is not there anymore, because i drank it.
where did you get too? we lost you after you opened up all the presents.
yeah.
yeah, i ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’
why, what happened?
ah, i fooled around with joey’s sister. (phoebe gasps) well, that is not the worst part.
what is the worse part?
i can not remember which sister.
(to rachel) you see what men do! do not tell me men are not nice! (points to chandler) this is men!!
are you insane? i mean joey, is going to kill you, he is actually going to kill you dead.
okay! you do not think i thought of that?
how can you not know which one?
i mean that is unbelievable.
i mean, was it gina?
which one is gina?
dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
no, no, no, that is dina.
(to monica) you see you can not tell which one is which either, dwha!!
we did not fool around with any of them. dwha! dwha!
veronica. look, it is got to be veronica, the girl in the red skirt. i definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
that was me.
look, when I have been drinking, sometimes i tend to get overly friendly, and I am sorry.
that is okay.
that is all right.
that is okay.
(angrily entering, to chandler) can i talk to you for a second?!
hey, joey.
hey. (they all walk away from chandler)
come on!! (motions for chandler to come with him)
why can not we talk in here? with, with, witnesses.
i just got off the phone with my sister.
ah, which, which one?
mary-angela.
mary-angela.
yeah.
y'know which one was she again?
why do not you ask chandler, ‘because he is the one that fooled around with her. she told me you said you could really fall for her. now is that true? or are you just gettin’ over janice by groping my sister.
it is got to be the first one.
really? that is great! you and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.
yep, I am in a tree.
did he call? did mark call?
no honey, I am sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.
oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) oh my god, is that phoebe?
i guess they are back from their date.
music. very nice.
oh my god!
so, how are you?
i am good. i finished my book.
oh yeah, what is it about?
i do not remember. do you want to take a walk?
yeah, i do. (they both run out)
dear mary-angela. hi. how is it going. this is the hardest letter I have ever had to write. (to chandler) what the hell’s a matter with you? how do you think joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
well, that is the part where you tell him that i moved to france. when actually I will be in cuba.
all right, look, look, you have got to do this yourself, okay in person. at least you know her name. you just go to the house and you ask for mary-angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
what if mary-angela comes to the door and i ask for mary-angela?
where in cuba?
(shocked) joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry. what about you?
I am here to see mary-angela.
you are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘because my grandma does not know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. she was like the sixth person to spit on mussolini's hanging body. yeah.
where is mary-angela?
she is right in there. (motions to the living room)
i can not believe mark did not call. it is sunday night, and he did not call.
bummer.
(to ross) yeah, right. look at you, you are practically giddy.
no, I am genuinely sorry the mark thing did not work out. look, rach, i want only good things for you.
wait a minute, why do not you just call mark. (they both look up in shock) i mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you have got to make stuff happen.
but, you, you do not want to seem too pushy.
(to ross) honey, it is not pushy, he gave her his home number.
(to rachel, as she gets his number) what, he gave you his home number? as in like, to, to his home?
yeah, and you do not mind if i call, because you only want good things for me.
that is right good things, that-that is what i said. (glances at monica)
(on phone) hello, mark? hi, it is rachel green. (listens) oh no, do not you apologize. (listens) yeah, I will hold. (to monica and ross) he left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
that is so made up!
(on phone) yeah, oh my god, tomorrow! that, no, it is perfect. oh god, thank you soo much. great! bye! (hangs up phone) i got the interview!
yay!
there you go.
he even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
oh, that is amazing!
yeah well, if i know mark, and i think i do, I would expect nothing less.
i got to figure out what I am going to wear.
high collar and baggy pants say I am a pro.
yeah! right! okay, I will see you guys later. (starts to leave) woo hoo!
you go get ‘them. (to monica) what did i do to you? did i hurt you in some way?
what?
‘why do not you call him?!’ well, thank you very much! y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
are you crazy?!
am i! am i! am i out of my mind! am i losing my senses!! this dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
what?! ross y'know this is not even about you! i mean this is about rachel and something wonderful happening for her. i mean you know even if you are right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
no.
i mean do not you trust her?
well, yeah!
then get over yourself! grow up!
(shyly) you grow up.
this teramisu is, is excellent. did you make it mary-angela?
well, it is, it is yummy. so mary-angela do you like it?
so um, mary-angela, what is your second favorite?
would you just please....give me the receipt ‘because this is great. it is top notch.
so will i.
oh no-no-no i was just squinting. that does not mean anything.
will you excuse me i have to um..... (walks to the hall)
(startled) hey!
look, i may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) um, i just got out of a relationship and I am not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
ahhhh, you are not mary-angela.
this is so bad. if-if you are not mary-angela, then-then who is?
oh, this is soo bad. (does not see mary-angela)
no joey! no joey! do not joey! joey!
what is going on?
(pats him on the shoulder) you are it! now run and hide!
what?! how could you do that, how could you think she was mary-angela?
i was not sure which one mary-angela was. (all of joey’s sisters gasp) look, I am sorry okay, i was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to joey) are ya?
well, that is usually what i would do. but i just never thought you would be on the receiving end of it. how could you do this?!
joey if you want to punch me, go ahead, i deserve it. but i just want you to know that i would never soberly hurt you or your family, you are my best friend. i would never do anything like this ever again.
no! no! no! no, I am not going to punch chandler.
no you will not. look he knows he did a terrible thing and i believe him, he is sorry. but, (to chandler) you have got one more apology to make, all right, you have got to apologize to mary-angela.
okay, absolutely!
all right.
you have got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still does not know which one is mary-angela.)
cookie, now you can punch him!
what?! (cookie punches him)
(getting of the elevator and noticing ross) hey!
hi!
what are you doing here?
ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so i... (gives her a flower)
oh.
hi. (kisses her)
hi.
how did did it go?
oh well, the woman i interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank god mark coached me, because once i started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and would not shut up.
I am so proud of you.
me too!
listen, I am ah, I am sorry I have been so crazy and jealous and, it is just that i like you a lot, so...
i know.
yeah.
yeah.
yeah. (turns around) hi mark!
oh, i did!
(to ross) oh my god!! (she turns around and hugs mark, not ross)
congratu!! (sees her hug mark) -lations-lations.
so ah, phoebe, how was your date?
oh well y'know. (laughs)
yeah, i do know.
ick, you were eavesdropping.
eavesdropping. pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
oh, I am sorry. but i really like this guy. and i think he really happens to like me.
maybe he is just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
all right, that is it! he cannot do this to phoebe. (gets up) this guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! (stops and turns around and asks rachel) but, is he a big guy?
ah, we will all go. (motions to chandler) come on. (the guys leave)
thanks you guys! thank you.
do not worry.
god, i hope they kick his ass!
honey, I am sorry.
y'know if it is any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. (rachel nods in agreement)
hey guys!
hi!
hey!
we need to talk to you about something.
yeah. we do not feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.
hey!
are you kidding?
well, it is just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just do not feel like we have the energy. plus, we do not think it is fair that every year the burden falls on us.
(skeptical) that does not sound like you... that is monica talking!
no, no! we made this decision together.
she is putting words in your mouth!
do not you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
i can not believe this! this is emma's first thanksgiving!
no, it is not!
it is not? (whispering to ross) when was she born?
well, personally i think it is great you are giving yourself a break.
thank you, pheebs!
sure. it is just as well... i mean, last year was not very good. i think she is losing her touch.
what? you are way off, lady!
am i? really? am i? well, why do not you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! well, think about it, think about it, you will be trying to top than you did last year. you would be in competition... with yourself.
that is my favourite kind! okay, we are doing this!
do not let yourself get manipulated this way!
hey, stay out of this, chandler! this is between me... and me!
we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you?
hey!
hi! happy thanksgiving!
oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
you guys, i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleecker. could you pick them up for me?
you are not making the pies yourself?
no, no, no, i do not make chocolate pies. when i was younger i-i enter in this pie-eating contest. i ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
did you at least win the contest?
2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! okay, i see you guys at 4.
can not wait!
this dinner is going to be so great! in your face, last year "me"!
hey rach.
yeah.
what is emma doing today?
well, let us see... uh... i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. why?
well, i want to enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
oh my god! that is the creepiest thing I have ever heard!
okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she is a real dog!
oh! phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
(sarcastic) oh... okay.
phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, i mean, you know, and judging who is cuter just for a trophy...
and a thousand dollars.
...is something I am very interested in! oh please, do not tell ross. he still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking ross) what is in the inside is important...
okay, oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
where am i going to get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving?
well, i was thinking...
oh, take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch kid.
yeah!
(chandler's laughing) did someone drop the baton again?
why come all the way from kansas to do that?
(she tastes what she has cooked) i do not get older. i just get better!
you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
you do not know that.
somebody is going to pick us.
yeah, but we have not heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
I am telling ya! it is going to happen. next year it is going to be you, me and the little hemingway bing. (pause) what, he is my favourite author!
name one of his books.
(after a long pause) "the firm"?
ok, let us see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year.
oh, chandler, that is sweet. but you do not have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do.
I am serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
ok, let us see... oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
tell me more.
okay, I am going to go check on something across the hall. you start by washing these (she gives chandler a bowl with cranberries. then, while she is going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) not with soap!! (she leaves)
you obviously have not tasted my palmolive potatoes!
hey! hey, guess what joey has!
three tickets to today's rangers game!!
dude, i wanted him to guess.
oh.
oh my god!
yeah, they are great seats too!
guess where they are?
center ice.
did i do something to you?
hmm, the game's at one.
so?
dinner is at four, we will never going to make it back.
so we will leave before it is over, we will be back in time.
you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
dude, two times that happened!
look, monica has been working hard all day, she did not want to host this thing in the first place, we should not go!
he is right, man.
right, i guess. alright, so see you at four.
okay. (pause) and get ready to taste my very special cranberries. or should i say... chanberries!
that is some gentle comedy, dude. (he and ross leave)
we are still going at the game, right?
yeah!
yeah.
hey.
oh phoebe, listen. well, i think we got to go. this place is really freaking me out. I have been watching this guy over there, i do not think he came with a kid!
we can not leave now! there was this one baby, haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! this competition just blew wide open, folks!
phoebe, i think... it is just too weird, i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
oh, i know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) it is okay. now, the way i see it, our real competition now is cameron. oh my god, they just took her sweater off. look at those arms! hello michelin man.
oh, phoebe! come on! you know what, it is already three of the clock and they have not even gotten to emma's group yet. we got to go, we got dinner!
(panicking) but emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
phoebe, you have to calm down.
okay. rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now! i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma!
really?
yeah!
you heard them say that?
yeah!
all right, okay. alright, let us give to these babies something to cry about!
good! oh yay! let us get down to business! emma needs some makeup!
no, what?
well, she is going to look all washed out next to the other contestants!
no phoebe, i am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
why not!
because i already did!
oh, bob, get off the guy!
oh! what a game, huh?
i know, yeah.
i can not believe chandler is missing this!
yeah. i am sorry he is not here too, but i got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where chandler should have been) i am really enjoying nacho chair.
yeah, I would probably enjoy it more if you did not keep batting my hand away.
ohhhh! these seats are great!
i know, i know! when i was here for holidays on ice (joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) i was sitting so far away michelle kwan could not read my banner!
(looks at the time) wow, hey, we would better get going. if we do not leave right now, we will be late for dinner.
oh, but it is a kind game! so we are a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let us stay just for one more goal.
i do not know...
one more fight!
okay.
okay.
where is everybody? they are forty-five minutes late!
i can not believe they are not here! i slave and i slave for what? they have ruined cranberry day!
how late are we?
forty-five minutes.
wow (he opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
(handing him his coat) here!
okay. rachel and phoebe are already there, okay? so they probably started without us. we could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there is a rangers foam finger)
you may want to lose the foam finger!
oh, no, no, no, no, no. you just want to put it on your hand!
hey!
oh!
you are not at thanksgiving?
no...
no, we are late!
what are you doing here!
we are late too! (rachel screams)
we figured we could be late because you guys were going to be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)
do not point that thing at me, tribbiani!
so, nobody's here? monica's going to kill us!
yeah, where were you!
yeah, yeah, what is with the trophy!
uh, we were at the spelling bee!
and i won!
you won an adult thanksgiving day spelling bee.
yes! (spells it) y-e-s. yes!
let me see this... (he takes the trophy from rachel's hands) grand supreme little darling, new york division.
yeah. that is me!
you entered emma into a beauty pageant?
and it looks like she put makeup on her!
wait a second, wait a second, where have i seen that cowgirl outfit before...
i can not believe this, she is our daughter! that you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
she won a thousand dollars!
so this is an annual thing?
(realizing) oh! that is alicia mae emory's outfit!
you guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
yeah. what are we going to do?
well, i do not know, you guys figure it out, i got to put emma down for a nap.
all right. hey rach, while you are in there, throw something on alicia mae.
alright, what are we going to say?
ooh, we will say that we were mugged! you can not get mad at someone who is been mugged!
oh, good, that is good, but you do not look like you were mugged!
no. here (he tears off the pocket from ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
(to joey) hey!
do you hear something? (chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
(peeping) they are out there!
ohhh! let me see! oh god, i can not believe this! they are an hour late and they are just staying out there, talking!
(peeping) everything is so distorted! looks like joey has a giant hand! which says "rangers" on it. they went to the game!
(gasps) oooh! they are in for a world of pain!
(looking through the peephole again) ross' shirt is torn.
oh! they are late and they are sloppy!
alright, emma is napping... (then to ross) what happened to your shirt?
i got mugged. and they stole my pocket.
we are just... we are trying to figure out an excuse. hey! ooh! how about this: we can say that monica told us 5 of the clock, not 4 of the clock. that way we are right on time! (others start to agree but she continues) or... or, we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her.
(sarcastic) that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around.
you know what, we just say that she said it was 5 of the clock. we will just act casual. we are not late, we are right on time. (when she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under monica's and chandler's door, into the hall. ross picks it up and reads it out loud)
(reading the note) we know you are out there. (rachel gasps)
(whispering) who do you think its from?
oh, god. this is bad. this is so bad.
well, let us just go in there and face them.
well, I am not going in first. i bet that vein on monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
i hate that thing, it is like a... bolt of lightning.
oh, hey, i have an idea. why do not we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and rachel has paper, phoebe and ross both have rock, while joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. they all look a him confused).
(smiling from ear to ear) ah-haah! i win!!
what is that?
that is fire. beats everything.
oh, really? does it beat water balloon? (she places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).
ooh! well played, phoebe buffay, well played.
alright, enough, enough, come on. let us just all go in at the same time.
it is locked.
wha...? oh sure, now they lock it, but when they are having sex on the couch, its like: "come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) alright, you guys. we are so sorry we are late. please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
no! everything's cold. the turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
yeah, and there is a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?
(rolling her eyes) nothing. it is fine.
(relieved) oh thank god!
come on you guys, we are sorry, alri...? our subway broke down.
(looking through the peephole) that is a lie, you went to the game, i can see joey's hand.
(to joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) for the love of god take it off!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
you guys, come on, it does not matter why we are late. we are all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (a slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)
i had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (ross picks it up)
that is all the turkey you are going to get.
how are we going to decide who gets this?
(holds his fist up) water balloon! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to ross)
what are we going to do? I am starving.
(gasps) oh, i just remembered. we do have something to eat. monica put something in our oven this morning.
oh yeah!
hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
guys, I would listen to her. the vein is bigger than I have ever seen it. (monica looks at chandler)
huh... oh my god it is brussels sprouts. (they all look appalled)
that is worse than no food.
ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts!
stinky?!
please let me stay on this side of the door.
oh, i know... i still have my old key! (she goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) we can just unlock the door.
well, i do not know if that is such a good idea. they clearly do not want to be with us.
you know what? i do not want to be with them either, but it is thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (goes to unlock the door)
(to ross) just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? look them in the eye. i know i can get them to forgive us.
i do not know...
I am telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. he stares at ross like this without blinking) i can do it.
(staring back, and then breaks off) (to phoebe and rachel) yeah, he can do it!
oh!
oh! it all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
the cranberries...?
oh! enough! a monkey could have made  them!
(still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at monica and chandler as he did with ross earlier in the hall) hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
he is doing that weird eye contact thing. do not look at him, do not look at him! (they both look away)
come on you guys, we want you to know we are (his eye widen even more) very very sorry. (monica and chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) right guys?
i feel terrible.
(smiling) now let us not ruin this day. you worked so hard. let us move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
the floating heads do make a good point.
yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
so bad.
so bad.
(gets up) okay, okay. you two (to phoebe and rachel) go get the dessert. and I will let you in.
dessert?
yeah, i asked you and phoebe to pick up the pies. you did remember, right?
pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with emma's trophy in her hand). here! (gives it to monica).
grand supreme little darling?
congratulatioooons!
oh my god! you forgot the pies? well, i cannot believe this. you force me to make dinner, then you are an hour late and you forget the one little thing that i asked you to do.
really girls, not cool.
well, you manheads are not any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
hey! I am getting a little tired of this okay? we said we are sorry. it is thanksgiving for pete's sakes! a day of forgiveness!
it is a day to be thankful.
(to ross, mouthing) do not make me come up there!
it is too late for apologies.
fine! let us just go. i do not need your stupid dinner.
that would be a lot more convincing if you were not drooling.
ewww, is that what that is?
sorry!
come on you guys, let us just do our own thanksgiving.
yeah! I will cook!
yeah! let us go out.
hey!
yeah! you three have a nice thanksgiving.
the three of us?
yeah! you, chan, and the vein!
ha!
oh-oh! I am stuck!
joey, that is not going to work.
no seriously... I am really wedged in here.
I will pull you through.
okay.
(in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh stop! stop! I am worried about damaging my head.
a little late for that.
alright, hurry up, you got to do something.
alright, well, this does not change anything. (to chandler) okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
uhm, we have got turkey grease.
bring it.
i just want to say that I am sorry i referred to the vein as a seperate person...
here you go!
oh, that smells good!
okay.
okay, try it.
it is not working.
alright, we are going to have to unscrew the chain.
well hurry, i can not feel my ears!
can you ever feel your ears?
interesting...
chandler, where are your tools?
(sarcastically) oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i do not have tools!
i do, but rachel borrowed them.
i lent them to ross.
i gave them to joey.
i left them at the park.
oh!
(looking at joey's butt) I am finding it really hard not to mess with him.
I have already stuffed a bunch of brussel sprouts down his pants.
nice!
okay, i have to get that. now when i get back, i want you and your friends to be gone. thanksgiving is over. the vein has spoken.
it is really starting to hurt.
okay, look, I am going to pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? okay, so push!
just a sec., we are kind in the middle of something here.
ooh! stop putting things down my pants!
come on guys, push!
yeah! come on!
my cranberries!
(looking at himself) man, I have got food all over me.
argh! i can not believe what you did. monica's going to kill you!
(to monica) look! look! look what the... look what... look what the floating heads did!
(very emotional) i do not care.
what is going on?
that was the adoption agency...
and?
we are getting a baby!
are you serious? (they hug)
there is a pregnant woman in ohio, and she picked us!
I am so happy for you!
this thanksgiving kicks last thanksgiving's ass!
to monica and chandler... and that knocked up girl in ohio.
I am just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
i know. have you considered pageanting?
i can not believe they called, and we are actually getting a baby. (she kisses chandler)
oh, i know how you feel...
really?
sure. i went through the exact same thing with alicia mae emory... the waiting, the wandering... then one day... i get that call from toys "r" us... she was in stock!
that is the exact same thing.
wait a minute, wait. you are telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who did not want you back?!
yeah! oh my god! (to chandler) is this what it is like to be you?
wow, you are really crazy about her, huh?
oh, you have no idea. and-and when we are on stage i get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it is like somebody is ripping out my heart!
oh, it is so great to see you feeling like this!
(entering) hey!
monica, uh dad called this morning and ah, aunt silvia passed away.
yes!! yes! yeah, yeah, yeah!
we were all pretty shaken up about it.
wait, am i missing something though? ‘because i thought death was something that is supposed to be sad, in a way.
well ah, aunt silvia was, well not a nice person.
oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! (ross gives her a look) (to ross) and I am sorry she died. did dad say i get the dollhouse?
you get the dollhouse.
i get the dollhouse!
wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! when i was kid, i had a barrel.
uh, pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
no, just a barrel.
y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
really?! really?!
any time you want. y'know, when i was younger, all i wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! it was to be looked at, but never played with.
my grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
hey, sophie!
hey.
thanks for lunch, chandler. y'know, you did not have to walk me all the way back up here.
oh, that is-that is okay, no problem. (he starts to look around her office.)
honey um, honey, you do realise that we do not keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?
yes, i realise that.
summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)
that is the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
(introduces them) joanna, this is my friend chandler bing (to chandler) joanna.
thanks, it is ah, gaelic, for ‘thy turkey’s done.’ so ah, I am going to go, nice, nice meeting you.
bye, chandler.
oh, nothing, he is just goofy like that, i actually, hardly notice it anymore.
no!! no! he is not married, or involved, with anyone!
well, I will ask him for you, if you want me too?
look at it! ohhh! wallpaper’s a little faded, that is okay. carpet’s a little loose. hardwood floors!!
(entering) hey!
hello.
oh! ooh! oh monica! it is so beautiful.
i know!!!
so, I am here, ready to play.
okay.
i brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. ha-ha. (she removes this large ceramic dog that comes up to the second floor and places it next to the house.)
what is this?
that is a dog, every house should have a dog.
not one that can pee on the roof.
well, maybe it is so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
(holding a tissue) and is this in case the house sneezes?
no, no, that is the ghost for the attic.
i do not want a ghost.
well, nobody wants a ghost. but you have got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient indian burial ground.
wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient indian burial ground? that would never happen.
okay, obviously you do not know much about the you.s. government.
(entering) hey!
i need to talk to you!
sure, what is up?
oh, sorry. i meant chandler.
i-i know. well if something comes up... (walks away)
oh, I am glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
okay, my boss, joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? dug my action, did she? checkin’ out the chan-chan man!
(looks at him) that was (pause) surreal. okay, what do think? are you interested at all?
yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I will do it.
oh thank you, chandler, this is so great, she is going to love me.
(holding a dinosaur) okay, dinosaur attack!! quick, everybody into the house!! ahh-ahh! (the dinosaur starts attacking the house. she starts to bark like a dog.) roof! rrroof-roof-roof!
okay, phoebe, y'know what? that-that is it, that is it, all right? no dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? they are not the right size, they are not victorian, and they just do not go.
okay, (starts to pack up her stuff) fine. come dinosaur, we are not welcome in the house of no imagination.
uh, pheebs, while we are hovering around the subject. i just have to say dinosaurs, they-they do not go, rrroof!
the little ones do.
hey, kate!
listen, i ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
(to himself) and i ate the food, i had the fish, it was good, yeah. it was good, yeah...
oh, hey! joey tribbiani.
(looks at her, shocked) what?!
get out of here, really?!
yeah?
they gave me the shaft all right.
well ahh, (he sees kate and the director kissing) yeah! yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
all right.
hey!
look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
wow!!
look, look! (she lifts up the roof, and the front panel falls revealing the interior.)
hey, what is this?!
oh, okay, it is the slide instead of stairs. watch this. (she slides a doll down the slide)
it is very interesting, phoebe.
what is this?
the licorice room, you can eat all the furniture. and, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
this is the coolest house ever!!
hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? (lights some incense)
all right!
i would!
hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
watch, watch. (she turns a strand of christmas lights strung around the house.)
and, and! (she turns on a bubble maker.)
(entering) hey, my father’s house does that!
(to chandler) of-of-of-okay, how did it go? tell me everything.
well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there is nothing like a cool, crisp new york evening.
hmm.
of course, i did not get to enjoy any of that, because joanna’s such a big, dull dud!
what?!
oh, i....
oh, i know...
come on baby, do not go. please? what do you say?
(to kate) that guy’s like a cartoon. what do you see in him anyway?
hey, I am not interested in her sweater! it is what is underneath her sweater that counts. and besides, since ah, since when do you care who I am going out with?
do you want me to want you to care?
what?
come on baby, do not go. please? what do you say?
hey, it is going to be all right.
what?
oh, yeah, with the mug painting. yeah. i was so listening to that. but ah, y'know what, i think i kind of need to work on my stuff tonight.
okay. (he gives her a peck on the cheek)
okay.
(to kate) ah, are you okay?
i do not know.
how do you mean?
maybe he could slip her the tongue.
yeah, yeah, and then adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
and then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
something like that?
yeah.
(to ross) hey.
hi.
(to monica) hey.
hi.
hey.
it is a little early to be drinkin’.
no-no, things ah, finally happened with kate.
ohhhhh!
you are kidding?! that is great!
oh, it was so amazing. after the (pause) love making...
oh my.
yep. i just, i just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. and then i knew she was dreaming ‘because, ‘because her eyes keep going like this. (he closes his eyes and moves them around, kind of like he is been processed by the devil, or something.)
(entering with rachel) I am telling ya, joanna’s got it all wrong. okay? all i said was, ‘this was fun. let us do it again sometime. I will give you a call.’
ohh, gee. i wonder why she thinks you are going to call her?
that is what you say at the end of a date.
you can not just say, ‘nice to meet you, good night?’
to her face? look it is the end of the date, I am standing there, i know all she is waiting for is for me to say ‘I will call her’ and it is just y'know, comes out. i can not help it, it is a compulsion.
come on rach, when a guy says he is going to call, it does not mean he is going to call. has not it ever happened to you?
well, they always called.
hmm, bite me.
no. sorry.
okay, okay. umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
well...
no. i...
(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) call her! call her now!
multiple, so many paper cuts.
why has not he called rachel? why? why? i do not understand. why? he said he will call. why? why? chandler I am telling you she has flipped out, she is gone crazy!
(sarcastic) oh, well give me the phone then.
come on, this is not funny. she thinks it is my fault that you have not called her. you have to call her!
look, you can not call somebody after this long just to say, ‘in case you did not notice, i do not like you!’
well then you are going to have to take her out again.
nooo!! she is really dull! and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
i do not care! i do not care! you are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it is actually ended. and, i do not care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
all right! fine! but it is just a lunch date, no more than an hour! and from now on i get my own dates, i do not want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
that is fine!
that is just a lot of big talk, y'know.
i know.
mon?
(from the bathroom) I am in the shower!
oh, fire! there, there is a fire! fire!!
hey.
so i ah, talked to lauren, kind of told her how things were with us. did you ah, did you talk to marshall?
y'know, about what happened with us.
what are you talking about? it was a big deal. i mean, come on you can not tell me last night did not mean something to you. i-i was there, you are not that good an actress.
nooo.
hi, lauren.
sorry i ah, i scared you in there.
oh, that is okay. by the way, i was just checking the shower massager.
yeah.
(entering) hey!
(runs over to her) i tried to reach you at work. there is....been a fire.
what?! oh my... (sees the remains of the house) oh my god!! what happened?!
well, we believe it originated here. (he uses a pointer and points to the point of origin.) in the aroma room.
all right. did everyone get out okay?
well, the giraffe’s okay. and so is the pirate.
ohh. what is this? (she sees a tissue covering something, and moves to remove it.)
no phoebe, do not look! you do not want to see what is under there!!
(she pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) ohh, the-the foster puppets!
it is not a big deal. it is, just it is right here, (points to his eye) and it is all the time.
(he looks over at rachel, who nods her head) yes, this, this was pleasant.
the food there was, was great.
so take care.
well, this was great. I will give you a call. we should do it again sometime. (rachel is disappointed)
sophie’s desk.
(whispering) chandler!! are you going to call her!
noo!
chandler!!
look, I am sorry. okay? I am weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
okay, you are going to tell her and you are going to tell her now. (she grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)
ahhhh—I am not going to call you.
I am sorry. I am-I am-I am sorry that i said i was going to when I am not. look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? and this is not rachel’s fault. it is me. i have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. i have issues with commitment, intimacy, (pause) mascara goop. and I am really sorry, it is just that this is not, this is not going to work out.
yeah, of-okay.
well this is great! I will give you a call! we should do it again sometime!
(on phone) well, so anyway beth, what I am saying is i should have considered your feelings before i went home with you that night. I have ah, I have recently learned what is it like to be on your side of it, and I am sorry. so, do you think you can forgive me? (listens) great. thanks. okay, bye. (he sits down and crosses out something, and dials the phone again.) hello, jennifer? (listens) oh hi, mrs. loreo, is jennifer there? (listens) oh, she is not home huh? (listens) well ah, actually i kind of need to talk to you too.
hey!
hey! wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
(not amused) ha-ha. (she sits down on the couch.) no, it is just I am so pregnant that i—my guitar does not fit anymore. so i thought ‘til I am not, I am just going to play all my songs on this drum. it sounds really cool!
all right.
listen. listen. (she starts to play and sing.) smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?
wow, pheebs! that sounds great!
i know! i know, and I have only been playing for like an hour!
hey! what are you doing here?
oh, well, do not tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
would not that be frank the iii?
wow! that is so great! oh! oh! cougar.
hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? twice?
hey, uh, you can ignore that.
uhh, believe me when he is older, he will understand.
I will be right there. (he goes over and opens the door to carol, susan, and ben.) (to ben.) hello! (to carol.) hello! (to susan.) hey. uhh, emily, this is carol and susan.
look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…
oh come on! that is-that is… true.
hi!
hey!
hey! do we have a baby name yet?
ugh! no! this is so hard! i went through this whole book (holds up a book) and found nothing! i want a name that is really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? like-like exxon.
well, it certainly worked for that valdez kid.
ooh-ooh, pheebs, you want a strong name? how about, the hulk?
no, I am-I am not sure about hulk, but i like the idea of a name starting with "the."
oh, want a good name, go with joey. joey’s your pal. joey’s your buddy. "where is everybody?" "well, they are hanging out with joey."
hey, y’know what, if you are going to do that, if you are going to name him joey, you should name him chandler. (phoebe does not think so.) oh, come on! chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he is very loveable, once you get to know him.
oh well, hey, joey’s loveable too! but the thing about joey is, if you need him, he will be there.
well, chandler will be there for you too. i mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he will be there. and he will bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you are really hot.
what do ya say? what do ya say?
well, i, i like the idea of naming him after someone i love, and joey and chandler are great names. (they both stare at her.) but, all right, i do not—maybe I will just name him the hulk.
i knew i should not have mentioned it! that is what i wanted to name my kid!
hey, mon, if you were hoping to sleep with joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (she is holding two frilly, lace nighties.)
y’know what? it really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.
sorry. I am so exited! I have been waiting for this for months! i got my hair coloured! i got new sheets! I am making him a very fancy meal.
um-hmm.
what am i making him by the way?
well, you are making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
i thought i was making him filet mignon?
yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. and then you realised if you (points at rachel) bitched about it, then you (points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (points at rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke.
wow, i really get crabby when i cook.
hey!
hey!
hey!
so uh, emily called last night…
and now you are giving me the message!
turns out them emily is just crazy about susan. yeah, they are going to the theatre together! they are going to dinner! they are going horseback riding!
god, susan is so fun!
look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? for like, for like six months before carol and i spilt up, all i heard was: "my friend susan is so smart. my friend susan is so funny. my friend susan is so great."
you actually think that something can happen between emily and susan?
hey, they are going to the gym together! two women! stretching! y’know they-they take a steam together! things get a little playful—did not you see personal best?
no, but I am going to!
hi! hi! you are crazy! okay? this is emily. emily is straight.
how do you know? i mean we thought carol was straight before i married her!
yeah, i definitely. i do not like the name ross.
what a weird way to kick me when I am down.
no! no! i-i meant for the baby!
oh. what is wrong with ross?
well, it is just y’know that something like this would never to like the hulk, y’know…
actually that-that is not true, in the incredible hulk uh, no. 72, dr. bruce banner found… (sees everyone staring at him and stops.) y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (leaves.)
so, i decided I am definitely going to go with either joey or chandler.
oh! oh-oh, you got to pick joey! i mean, name one famous person named chandler.
raymond chandler.
someone you did not make up!
okay, there are no famous joey’s. except for, huh, joey buttafucco.
yeah, that guy really hurt us.
well, how about a compromise then, okay? what if it is like y’know, chanoey?
okay, look, joey! come on, think about it, first of all, he will never be president. there is never going to be a president joey.
all right look man, i did not want to bring this up, but chandler, is the stupidest name i ever heard in my life! it is not even a name; it is barely even a word. okay? it is kind of like chandelier, but it is not! all right? it is a stupid, stupid non-name!
wow, you are, you are right. i have a horrible, horrible name.
I am sorry man, i did not—I am-I am sorry. I am sorry. (goes over and comforts him.)
okay.
so i guess it is joey then!
ohh, please! cooking soothes me. (they kiss.) ahh. so, dig in!
(taking a bite) hmmm!
oh i know, my god, this is so—this rice is so—i am so good.
(sees the chick and the duck) oh, yeah, I am sorry. they used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
yeah, sure, okay. okay.
(answering the door.) hey, how did you do that?! come on in. (he brings them inside.)
all gone! so, farm birds, huh?
oh.
okay. so, can i serve you a little of—what? what? what? (she sees that joshua is not relaxed.)
but, they are across the hall! i mean that is two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? i mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.
your parents’?
ohh.
yeah that works.
(opening the door.) hey!
well, i asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "no." i asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "no." i asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "no." so, he is sweeping. (we see ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)
so umm, any word from susan?
uh-huh. uh-huh. uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, i do not know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
y’know, the kind of fun, you and susan had when we were married.
am i?!
am i?!
uh-huh, carol, so were we. all right, just-just imagine for a moment, susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. y’know? say-say they are coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they are laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… there is electricity, it is new. it is exciting. are you telling me there is not even the slightest possibility of something happening?
oh my god!! i did not really believe it until you just said it!!
wow! this place is fabulous!
whoa-whoa, there is two living rooms? god, growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. want to make out?
that sounds like a plan. umm, is there a place i can go freshen up?
ah.
hi you!
i know, i can do more than cook.
ohh! it is so nice to meet you. (she goes over and shakes their hands.) hello.
hello.
what? this-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that is-that is not what it is. see, see, okay, i work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. it is-it is, they are-they are wearing it in milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then i see how people respond, and then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdale’s, so… and obviously in uh, in-in this case, (she grabs a pen and paper) i am going to report back, "usa not ready."
yes!
well, we were going to do that after—i mean umm, next.
oh, yeah, well… yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.
yes.
dude, i am sorry about what i said!
no, no, you are right, it is a ridiculous name!
it is not that bad.
yes it is! from now on, i have no first name.
so, you are just bing?
i have no name.
all right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, clint.
no way are you cool enough to pull of clint.
okay, so what name am i cool enough to pull off?
umm, gene.
it is clint. it is clint! (he heads for his bedroom.)
see you later, gene.
bye, gene.
it is clint! clint!
what is up with gene?
so, you wore your nightie to dinner?
oh, yeah. and uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, i jumped up, and my boob popped out.
oh my god!
oh, no!
no, it is all right. i got nice boobs. (phoebe and monica nod there heads in agreement.)
(returning from the phone.) so, i just picked up a message from emily, she and susan are going to a poetry reading together!
so?
so! poetry? susan’s gay! they are being gay together!
emily’s straight.
oh, wake up!
wow, carol really messed you up!
excuse me?
yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. (they all look at her.) all right, so i do not know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
look, i do not know what you are talking about, i am not a crazy, jealous person.
huh.
what?
she is totally right! when we were together, you got all freaked out about mark and there was nothing going on.
this totally makes sense!
it does not!
oh, sure it does! in high school, you were not jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
all right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, carol left him and bamn! paranoid city!
absolutely! absolutely!
this is so much fun!
this is not fun!
look, all we are trying to say is, do not let what happened with carol ruin what you got with emily.
yeah. the ’92 ross would not.
well, i still think i was right about that whole mark thing.
what—yeah—what, y’know what? i hope emily is a lesbian.
drum roll.
(entering) okay. okay. all right. help! am i a mark, or a john?
nah, you are not tall enough to be a mark, but you might make a good barney.
all right look, am i serious, okay? tomorrow at 3:30 i am going down to the courthouse.
you are actually going through with this?
hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. okay, it is probably why kids picked on me in school, and why i never do well with women… so, as of 4 of the clock tomorrow, I am either going to be mark johnson or john markson.
you got problems because of you! not your name! all right, this has got to stop! chandler is a great name! in fact—yes, (to joey) I am, I am sorry. i know you really wanted me to name the baby joey, but eh, so, I am-I am, I am going to, I am going to name the baby chandler.
(pleased) really?!
yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
okay. thanks.
okay!
you want to hug it out?
yeah!
yay!
yay!
yay—oh—yay! okay, i got to go tell frank and alice! right now!
okay!
ooh, uh… (she grabs her coat and runs out.)
bye, pheebs!
okay, bye!
ha! ha! ha!
ohh! (realises it was all a trick to get phoebe to name the baby chandler.)
nice luggage.
hi!
oh, i missed you too.
(to carol) no tongue. (and gives her the thumbs up.)
no-no-no-no, we are done.
aunt syl, stop yelling! all I am saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, i would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
ross, did you really read all these baby books?
yup! you could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and i can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (joey grimaces)
and, we are done with the yogurt. (sets yogurt down on table)
(softly) sorry. (camera pans back to monica, still on phone)
aunt syl, i did this as a favor, i am not a caterer. what do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to aunt syl on phone, looks shocked) nice talk, aunt syl. (in new york accent) you kiss uncle freddie with that mouth?
hey ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) this is your baby. (in baby-like voice) hi daddy!
(waves) hello!
(in baby-like voice) how come you do not live with mommy? (pause; shows ross less than amused) how come mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; ross still looks less than amused; joey smiling) what is a lesbian? (playfully hits ross)
honey, you can say it, poconos, poconos, it is like poc-of-nos (touching paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
so, did i hear poconos?
yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
yeah, that is a big step.
i know...
(to ross) ah, it is just a weekend, big deal!
was not this supposed to be just a fling, huh? should not it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
i mean, we are way past the fling thing, i mean, i am feeling things that I have only read about in danielle steele books, you know? i mean, when I am with him, I am totally, totally...
...nauseous, I am physically nauseous. what am i supposed to do, huh? call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) i could call immigration!
i love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
ok, you are going to have to stop that, forever!
need a new table.
you think?
hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses carol) i brought all the books, and monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
(pauses) I am pretty sure that it is...
(making flinging gestures with hands) oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
oh, that is great, that is great! (hugs and kisses carol. then picks up a picture frame)
hey, when did you and susan meet huey lewis?
(surprised, chuckling nervously) of course it is your friend tanya. (looks up frightenedly)
(chuckles nervously) the sex? (chuckles) um, I am having enough trouble with the image of you and susan together, when you throw in tanya (miming washing hair, that is the best i could think of), yaw...
oh, you know the sex of the baby? oh, oh-oh-oh!
no, no, no, no, no, i do not want to know, absolutely not. i think, you know, i think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) or is not...
susan...
yes, we did, everything's a-ok!
(flailing arms in protest) oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who does not want to know, standing right here!
ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
(interrupts) no, no, no i do not want to know, do not want to know. ok, you know, i should probably, i should probably just go.
no problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses carol's stomach, then punches susan's shoulder) susan... (ross leaves.)
(on intercom) uh, never mind, i do not want to know. (carol and susan laugh)
ok, so it is just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one?
that is the rule.
what rule? there is no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
how did you get to that?
well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio
you knew about that?
well, let us just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
ok, ok, how about if we split it?
what do you mean, like, buy it together?
yeah
you think we are ready for something like that?
why not?
well, it is a pretty big commitment, i mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
why, are you moving out?
I am not moving out.
you would tell me if you were moving out right
yeah, yeah, it is just that with my last roommate kip...
aw, i know all about kip!
it is just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me?
aw, do not do that
ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)
oh, paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
well, racquela's right, yeah!
oh, okay, i do not know what you just said, so let us get started.
um, that is really your decision, i mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! you are being naked!
(to ross) i can not believe you do not want to know. i mean, i could not not know, i mean, if, if the doctor knows, and carol knows, and susan knows....
and monica knows...
wha, heh, how could you know, i do not even know!
carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, i asked, she told me.
so what is it going to be? (monica whispers in joey's ear. ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)
wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and i do not know!
I am sorry, I am just excited about being an aunt!
or an uncle...
hi pheebs!
pheebs!
fine!
phoebe, what is the matter?
nothing, I am sorry, I am just, I am out of sorts.
oh, right, that is me!
hey, chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
fine. (joey and chandler walk towards the door)
phoebe, what is it?
all right, you know paolo?
I am familiar with his work, yes...
well, he made a move on me.
whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
more coffee over here, please!
well, what happened?
well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (a flashback starts paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up phoebe's legs.)
my god.
are you sure?
oh yeah, I am sure. (flashback resumes with phoebe doing a voiceover.) and all of a sudden his hands were not the problem anymore. (flashback continues: paolo rolls over, phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)
was it...?
oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
"ooo," what?
uma thurman.
oh!
the actress!
thanks rach.
so what are you going to do?
you have to tell her! you have to tell her! it is your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, i think it is a feminist issue! guys? guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)
oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
feminist issue. that is where i went!
she is going to hate me.
sympathetic yet...) yeah, well...
will you pick one, just pick one! here, how about that one? (points to a table)
that is patio furniture!
so what, like people are going to come in and think, "uh-oh, I am outside again?" of course!
(gesturing towards another table) what about the birds?
i do not know, birds just do not say, "hello, sit here, eat something."
you pick one.
all right, how about the ladybugs?
oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
not like that, i will not! (pauses) kip would have liked the birds! (joey turns and gives chandler a dirty look)
hey!
hi pheebs!
are you moving out?
no, these are not all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to phoebe) this one's paolo's.
um, um, rachel can we talk for a sec?
well, sure...just a sec, though, because paolo's on his way over.
oh! (sits down) ok, um, ok, um,
oh, pheebs, pheebs...
ok, um, (clears throat) we have not known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. one, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, i never lie, and three, i make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (phoebe opens a tin and offers rachel a cookie)
(taking cookie) ok, thanks pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) oh my god, why have i never tasted these before?!
oh, i do not make them a lot because i do not think it is fair to the other cookies
all right, well, you are right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had.
which proves that i never lie.
i guess you do not.
paolo made a pass at me.
so, what do you think?
i think it is the most beautiful table I have ever seen.
i know!
so how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
who cares, we will eat at the sink! come on, let us play!
heads up ross! (monica scores on chandler and joey) score! (points at chandler) you suck!
are you okay?
i need some milk.
ok, I have got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) here you go... (rachel drinks straight from thermos) oh!(rachel finishes thermos) better?
no...oh, i feel so stupid! oh, i think about the other day with you guys and i was all "oh, paolo, he is so great, he makes me feel so..." oh, god, I am so embarrassed!
I am so embarrassed, I am the one he hit on!
pheebs, if i had never met him this never would have happened!
no, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
i do not know...right, he is the pig!
such a pig!
oh, god, he is such a pig,
oh he is like a...
he is like a big disgusting...
...like a...
...pig...pig man!
yes, good! ok...
(voice wavers) oh, but he was my pig man...how did i not see this?
(raises hand) oh! i know! (rachel startled) it is because... he is gorgeous, and he is charming, and when he looks at you...
ok, ok, pheebs...
the end.
oh, god...
should i not have told you?
no, no, trust, me, it is, it is, it is much better that i know. uh, i just liked it better before it was better...
i think she took it pretty well. you know paolo's over there right now, so...
we should get over there and see if she is okay. (switching places with ross) just one...second! score! (monica scores, high-fives with ross) game! come on. (monica and phoebe leave)
(wiping his brow) ah...ooh! well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
no-no, she kicked our butts. you could be on the olympic standing-there team.
come on, two on one.
what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it is time for you to swoop in!
what, now?
yes, now is when you swoop! you got to make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she is got to know that you are everything he is not! you are like, like the anti-paolo!
my catholic friend is right. she is distraught. you are there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross! (ross and chandler look off into the distance. joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
(entering) how is it going?
do not stare. now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there is just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), ok, that is either, "how could you?" or, "enormous breasts!" here he comes!
ooh!
oh, ok bye-bye.
paolo, i really hate you for what you did to rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but i still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
paolo, i-i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
oh, just look at her... (girls move toward rachel on the balcony)
oh you guys, i-i really think just one of us should go out there so she is not overwhelmed...
oh, you are right.
(pulls monica back) ...and i really think it should be me.
hey.
hey.
you all right?
ooh, I have been better...
come here. (he hugs rachel) listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, i mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
oh, ross...
what?
i am so sick of guys. i do not want to look at another guy, i do not want to think about another guy, i do not even want to be near another guy. (ross crosses arms)
huh.
oh ross, you are so great!
ohhhh (hugs her and sighs)
ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
oh...
you ok?
...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
yep!
see, rach, uh, see, i do not think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. i really do not. i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
no. i just need to be by myself for a while, you know? i just got to figure out what i want
uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a paolo.
no, i know, i know, and I am sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
(astonished) what?
what?
i-I am, I am having a boy?
uh...no. no, no, in fact, you are not having a boy.
wha-I am having, I am having a boy! (babbling) huh, am i having a boy?
I am having a boy! oh, I am having a boy!
wha-
wha-
I am having a boy! i-I am having a boy!
hey!
hey!
I am having a son. um...
yes! and that would be a shut-down!
where are you guys going? come on, one more game!
uh, it is 2:30 in the morning!
yeah, get out!
you guys are always hanging out in my apartment! come on, I will only use my left hand, huh? come on, wussies! (joey and chandler pick her up) all right, ok, i got to go. I am going, (they throw her out) and I am gone.
(to joey) one more game?
oh yeah!
joey? are you in there?
(hearing rachel and jumping up with his plate) oh god! that is rachel!
joey, you have to talk to her!
no-no, i can not! i can not! not after the other night, it is just it is…too weird, okay? do not tell her I am here! (turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) do not eat that! (runs to the bathroom as rachel enters.)
hey!
hey!
hey rachel!
is joey here?
i do not see him. (to monica) do you see him?
i do not see him. hey! maybe he is in the sugar bowl! (opens the sugar bowl) joey? nope! (closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)
well, at least you make each other laugh.
what is up?
well, i have not seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… i do not know, i think he is avoiding me. why is that bagel on the floor?
we were playing a game.
ew, was chandler naked? sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
sure.
what?! no! no!
all right. well listen, if you see joey will you just tell him uh…tell him i miss him. (exits and joey enters.)
(to joey) okay, did you hear that?
yeah, a naked bagel game? (picks up his dropped bagel.) (to chandler) dude, i do not know. that is a pretty small hole.
honey, you got to talk to her.
i can not! y’know? you guys do not know what it is like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
(incredulous) i do not know what that is like?! up until i was 25 i thought the only response to, "i love you," was, "oh crap!"
hello? no rejection? i got shot down at fat camp! boy, kids are mean when they are hungry.
all right so, so what do i do?
this is rachel. i mean, what are you going to do, never going to talk to her again? i mean i know it is weird, it is awkward, but you got to at least try.
yeah. okay. (goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) whoa! (stops.) i almost forgot this was on your…
(interrupting him) we did not play it!!
okay, so when you are done with your tea I will look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
i did not know you read tea leaves.
oh yeah, I have done it for years. i actually stopped because i was so accurate. y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it is-it is wondrous unpredictability. y’know? and also tea tends to give me the trots.
okay, I am done. read mine.
okay. (looks at the leaves.) ooh, i see a ladder. (checks the book) which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
(stunned) i-I am the head chef. i-i can not get promoted.
uh-hmm. uh-hmm, who is next?
okay, I am done. do mine.
okay. (reads the leaves) umm, oh! okay, i see a circle.
ah.
oh! (checking the book) which can either mean you are having a baby or you are going to make a scientific discovery!
well, i have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
what does yours say pheebs?
umm… wow, all right. (checks the book.) wow! yay! ooh, I am going to meet a guy! and really soon! and he is going to be the man of my dreams. probably not the guy i had a dream about last night. (points at chandler.)
(entering) hey! has anyone seen my shirt? it is a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
you mean your pink shirt?
faded salmon color.
no, i-i have not seen your pink shirt.
great! great. then i must have left it at mona’s. i knew it!
well, I am sure you get another one at ann taylor’s.
that is my favorite shirt! okay? i love that shirt!
well just ask mona to give it back!
i do not know. i mean i-i guess i could. it is just that we did not really end things such good terms. and if i go over there I would be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (walks away.)
(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I have been that guy everywhere i go. we take the same bus. we go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he is the tea guy. (he gets up to leave, and smiles at phoebe.)
phoebe, did you see that?! he totally checked you out! he is so cute! (looking at his tea.) mine has a picture of the village people, what does that mean?
hi!
hey.
hi.
hi.
tea gives phoebe the trots.
so i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out, but it is not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
i know it is tough now, but things will get better.
how do you know that? what if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can not even be in the same room with each other?!
I am not great at the advice, can i interest you in a sarcastic comment? some cheese?
honey, what is the bruce springsteen cd in the kat stevens case?
let us just say if i can not find the right cd case i just put it in the nearest one.
okay, where is the kat stevens cd?
in the james taylor case.
where is the james taylor cd?
honey, I am going to save you some time, 200 cds, not one of them in the right case.
okay. no need to panic. deep breathes everyone. okay umm uh, we are just going to have to spend some time and put the cds in the right cases.
well, if we are going to do that we should come up with some kind of order. y’know alphabetically or by genre?
hmm, i do not know. we really have to talk this through.
oh my god!! you guys have such problems!! i feel so terrible for you!
okay, i-I am sorry. you and joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
oh yeah. that makes sense.
yeah, like i do not know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
ooh, i can do that.
good. (to chandler) uh honey, the miami vice soundtrack? really?
they were just giving those away at the store (off monica’s look) in exchange for money.
(entering) hey!
hi.
uh i really do not know what to tell you rach, i really do not. i mean, maybe joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
what?
yeah joey she is…rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. wow! (to chandler) y’know what, if we are going to make dinner we are going to have to leave. yeah. (she and chandler exit.)
so you uh, have a…big work problem?
yeah it is umm… yeah it is uh… it-it is y’know—it is nothing.
huh. okay. (awkward silence.) so uh, i think I am going to take off.
yeah—no wait! joey no wait it is. it is something. it is-it is umm…it is my boss.
yeah?
yeah, and umm my baby.
yeah?
my boss wants to buy my baby!
what?! oh my-oh my god!
i know i told you, it is a really big problem.
what he wants to buy your baby?!
can you believe that?!
that is crazy!
that is what i told him!
okay, how did this even happen?
well I will tell ya! (pause) see uh my-my boss and his wife—they-they can not have children. so umm, and that—we were at the christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "rachel, i want to buy your baby."
man! when you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby i figured it was something about maternity leave.
ohh! yeah! (pause) yeah that-that would have been a much simpler problem.
oh hello.
oh jim, jim nelson I am phoebe, phoebe buffay. we certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
well, maybe we will. (starts to walk away.) oh! (she turns around and the exchange information.)
mona? (there is no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. he reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. he looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. after dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter mona’s apartment.) okay, if i were a salmon shirt, where would i be? (he hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)
oh my god, honey we are so meant to be together. we both have copies of the annie soundtrack.
honey, both yours.
(entering) hey! great advice on that joey thing!
yeah? the work problem?
oh it was perfect! i mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
what problem did you tell him you had?
oh that is not important. the point is, i really—i think everything’s going to be okay.
do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
is not it funny how we kept running into each other? it is as if someone really wants us to be together.
oh, witty banter. well done.
oh okay, well I am a masseuse, and i used to work at this place…
i-i-i like, i like parties.
yeah i guess, a little.
(a little freaked out) so! umm, anyway i-i lived in new york, someone wildly i guess, for umm—well since i was fourteen.
oh stop it.
okay. umm look, you are coming on a little strong. but I am going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. so, why do not we just start over okay? and you can just tell me about yourself.
okay.
what?!
oh my god!
wow! you do?
all right. (gets up and walks out.)
(singing) the sun’ll come out…tomorrow! bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow… (the girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) …there will be sun.
(entering) hey!
hey! oh joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. that really meant a lot.
not a problem. oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
(worried) what?
let us just say i took care of it.
whoa-whoa-whoa, let us say more!
do not worry! do not worry. i just told him, very nicely, "you do not go buying people’s babies, so back off!!"
what?!
no! no, no-no-no joey he does not want to buy my baby! i made that up!
what?! why?!
so that we would have something to talk about! so it would not be awkward!
and you could not think of anything else?!
you said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
(to joey) i can not believe that you yelled at my boss! I am-I am going to lose my job! what am i going to do?!
you can always sell your baby.
oh joey, i can not believe you brought my boss into this! I am going to get fired!
you lied to me!
well, she told me too! (points to monica and joey glares at her.)
chandler has two copies of annie!
hello!!
not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
morning. you wanted to see me?
okay look mr. zelner…
yeah. (motions for him to continue.)
oh god.
well, as long as we are clear about that. (exits smugly.)
oh there it is.
that is not your regular dry cleaners.
i know, but that creep that i went on that date with goes to there so i have to find a new one. i also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…
what?!
a new grocery store. the universe said i was going to meet a nice guy and that is what they gave me? (looks up) when i get up there I am going to kick some ass.
do not worry phoebe, you are going to meet someone. if i can meet a great guy, so can you.
yeah, we both can. and we both will.
oh, you did not have to come in with me.
are you kidding? this is where they get out stains! okay? this is like disneyland for me. I am-I am going to be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. (she points to and walks over to the electric clothes rack they have.)
okay.
what?
oh yeah well, I am sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
a little. (she turns around and looks up.) (to the universe) now you are talking.
i-i-I would love to. let me just tell my friend.
(to the clerk) ooh, an ink stain! hey, can i watch how you get this out?
(looking around) she must have left.
hi.
so? what-what-what happened?
it is all going to be okay. they are just so happy that I am not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. so long as i understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child i should bear.
wow, ralph lauren is really going out of there way to show they are not in the baby buying business.
chandler, can you give us a minute?
oh I am sorry, you are kicking me out of my own living room?
yeah.
I will be in there. (goes into the bedroom.)
joey, I am really sorry that i lied to you. i was just trying to make things…
i know. i know.
it kind of worked. i mean y’know, i do not know about you buy i have not thought about our thing since all this.
hey you are right. yeah, it is kind of been like us again a little bit.
yeah i know! i miss that.
me too. i mean i…have not thought at all about how i put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you did not feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
my gynecologist tried to kill me.
(on phone) item j437-a, color: winterberry. (there is a knock on the door as he hangs up the phone. he answers it to mona.) hi umm, listen come here, come in. (she does so.) I am so-so sorry about yesterday. i-I am really sorry. it is just that i… (he picks up the pink shirt.)
you do?
(faking starting to cry) oh god you are right.
(laughs) no. (takes the shirt back.)
(to joey) what is so funny?
oh, nothing, no. it is an acting exercise, I am practising my fake laugh.
oh. (she laughs)
what-what is so funny?
oh come on man! at least let me finish this last one.
okay.
no-no, why do not you hang on to that one.
okay, that is like the least fun game ever.
well, I am really sick of your smoking, so i brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)
oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) nope, that patch is no good. (joey and monica both do their fake laughs.)
come on, it is a hypnosis tape. this woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she has not smoked since.
pffhah.
(to ross) what is your problem?
nothing, it is just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
ross, i watched you get hypnotised in atlantic city.
hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! okay.
oh right, ‘because you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
all right, y'know forget hypnosis. the way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
or what my father called thursday night.
here you go.
oh, y'know what, i did not want cinnamon on this.
sorry. (to remedy that, ross scoops the cinnamon off of the top with his hand.)
oh my god!!
frank! hi!
what are you doing here?
what happened?
but, also, what happened between you and your mom?
your getting married?!
my little brother’s getting married!!
do i?
yeah, i do, yeah.
y'know, i would have bet good money that he would be the first one of us to get married.
yeah, is not it fantastic?
yeah, ah, but pheebs do not you think he is a little young to get married?
what, he is 18.
exactly, it will be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
always illegal joe.
yeah, I am a big surprise.
so, um, how-how did you guys meet?
if that does not keep kids in school, what will?
and so now you guys are going to be married?
oh my god!! great!
wow, kids. frank, are you sure you are ready for that?
oh good! okay. ‘because you were acting like you did not.
and y'know what, i just realised, in the last year I have only gone out with two guys, richard and julio. you got to help me out here, you got to set me up, you got to get me back in the game.
well, that should not be a problem. i mean i work in fashion and all i meet are eligible straight men.
(to a customer) pete, can i get you something else?
have not you and i covered that topic?
aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that i serve you food.
(laughs) well, i mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? i mean that are not a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what i mean. that wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
i mean really, think about it.
no, i know, i know, that this is frank’s life, (walks behind them, they turn around in the leather chairs to face her) y'know. y'know, i do not want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it is sick and wrong!
pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
no-no, oh, I am fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it is tongue down my little brother’s throat!
pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
but, i mean, do you think he is going to enjoy it when he is up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! this is not fair to frank, (she walks behind them again, and hey again turn to follow her) and it-it is not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it is not good home economics.
well, have-have you told him how you feel?
yes. not out loud.
pheebs, if you do not tell him, soon he is going to be married, and then you are going to hate yourself.
yeah, but if i do tell him, then he is going to hate myself. i mean look at him and his mom, i can not. (pause) but, you guys can, please you got to talk him out of it.

i think you should definitely go out with this guy.
nah, he does not do anything for me.

hey mon, let us give pete a chance come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
what check thing?
as a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. his number is on the check, he just did so I would call him.
(reading the check) pete becker. pete… (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) is this him?
that is bill clinton.
who is he huggin’?
oh my god! that is pete! but why is bill huggin’ pete?
this guy invented moss 865! every office in the world uses that program!
we use it!!
there you go!!
oh my god, monica’s going to go out with a millionaire.
I am not going to go out with him.
oh my god, i can not believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
or incredibly offensive.
oh yeah, sure, that too.
(to the girls who are staring at him) what?
all we are saying is do not rush into anything.
yeah, come on, think about it. you are 18, okay, she is 44, when you are 36, she is going to be 88.
look, the point is, there is a lot of women out there you have not even had sex with yet!
yeah, he-he is right, he is right. this is your time y'know, yeah, you are young, you are-you are weird, chicks dig that.
yeah, in a poem maybe.
no the man’s right, that is what i had with rachel.
no, i ah, i slept with someone else.
it did not.
now, wh-what, what is that like?
yeah, yeah.
(to ross) why can not i find that?
do not ask me, i had it and i blew it!
well, i want it!
i do not know, maybe i can not. i mean, maybe there is something wrong with me.
oh, no! no!
then you hold on to it!!
all right, congratulations you lucky bastard! (hugs him)
(to joey) you are frank’s best man?!
i could not help it, there love is so pure.
well then, (to ross) what about you?! huh?!
I am the ring bearer.
hi! oh, alice, hi! thanks. I am so glad you could come, ‘because I have got a real umm, home ec emergency. (points to the table cloth, which has a huge mustard stain on it.)
yeah, i know. it is a real mustard-tastrophe. can you help me?
y'know what, forget it. it is ruined.
or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother frank.
what the hell is this? (holding up the check)
seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
you are supposed to double the tax. not double the tax of romania. i mean, what is-what is the deal? are you, are you trying to buy me? is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
what?!
okay, umm, you are a loon.
i do not know.
‘because i do not want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
okay. whoa, sorry. why were you just like all in the dark?
oh, yeah, sure. so, how was your day?
what umm, what happened?
oh no. did umm, did she say why?
yeah, yeah, no, i do not, i do not know. but, y'know what, maybe it is just all for the best?
oh, sweetie, oh. (hugs him)
uh, well i can tell you why. it is, it is because of me. but, y'know what, i only did it because i love you. okay?
umm, well i, i kind of had a little chat with alice, and i sort of made her see why you two should not be together, y'know. and you are going to see it to, one day, you really, really will.
okay.
okay, but.
oh my god! the millionaire’s here!
(in a feminine way) oh my god! (and he jumps all around)
guys, please, I am just going to have dinner with him. okay?
okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
i know!!
okay, then get the lobster!
(opening the door) (to pete) hey!
hi!!
hey!
hi!
hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?
and that is why, I am not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) bye.
just one drink?!
(in the hallway) so, where do you want to go?
oh, that is sounds great.
oh come on, it is only fair, you paid for the flight. now is, is that enough lire?
why, how much is that?
every night!!
hey, frank. look, okay, i know that you think i did like this totally evil thing, but i so did not. there is someone here who can explain this better than i can.
yeah, but not just that.
none the less.
that is right, exactly. (sees them) all right, it is a good bye kiss, that is good. (frank picks alice up and they move to the couch) bye-bye. (they both lie down on the couch and start to make out.) okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I am saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. (they ignore her) okay, I have decided I am going to let this happen! okay, can i just get my purse? (she reaches in and alice moans) okay, all right, good. (leaves).
(he is recorded his voice on the tape) joey’s your best friend. you want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. (he laughs) and you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
hey! ready to go?
oh yeah, let me just finish this.
hey ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, i can not do that!
what are you doing?
have you seen this? it is a new alumni website for college! it is cool! you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you are up to.
great, a faster way to tell people that I am unemployed and childless .
it is actually kind of interesting to find out what people are doing... remember andrea rich?
the tall girl who would not sleep with you?
uh uh... well, her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
bet she would sleep with you now...
no... i already e-mailed her.
let me see what you wrote about yourself: "doctor paleontology, two kids... " (pause) you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you have one very similar interest!
you know what? I am going to finish this later, ok? let me just grab my coat.
hey! (he throws the basketball against a table again)
(he picks up the ball) what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? (he enters another room)
maybe we finish this for him! (he sits down on the sofa and he start typing on ross' computer) "also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she is now my girlfriend. i do not care what society says. it is the best sex I have ever had"... aaand send!
(he stops chandler from posting the message) no, no, no... what do... you can not do that to him!
(he comes back) alright, let us go!
dude! (he opens his arms to receive the ball from ross' hands)
i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
(after ross leaves the room) aaand send! (he hits the send button)
hey! how was basketball?
oh, it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye!
oh, no! who did that?
chandler... hey... (he goes towards his room but he stops near emma's cot) rach... what is hugsy doing in the crib with emma? (he looks puzzled)
she was just crawling around and she found him, so i just let her sleep with him. that is all right? is not it?
(still very puzzled) oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it is a stuffed animal... you know... it is for kids... not for adults... i know that!
joey... are you sure? i mean, i know how much you love him!
rachel... let us be clear on this, ok? i do not love hugsy. i like him a normal amount...
all right... oh, emma loves him!
why would not she? he is a wonderful person!
hi.
hey phoebe... how you doing? you feelin' better?
breaking up sucks! oh, i really miss mike!
oh, I am so sorry!
oh god, i tried everything to make myself feel better. i even tried writing a song about it... but... i can not think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh!! (pause) hey monica, i really need your help getting through this...
you are not going to need my help?
well no, when i get to the point where... you know... I am ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike... I am going to come to you.
oh good, because I have already thought of 3... 4! I have just thought of a fourth (he goes towards the counter)
ok. i mean i know i did the right thing. you know, mike never wants to get married and i should not be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I am going to miss him so much. I am going to want to see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
ok, you got it!
(after a pause) unless... maybe it is too crazy about this... alright so... you know, there is no future... but that does not mean we still can not have fun. you know what? forget what i said.
really? if that is what you want...
that was a test and you just failed.
damn it! rookie mistake!
(yelling at chandler) i have sex with dinosaurs??
i believe i read that somewhere!
that only is not funny, it is physically impossible! ok? depending on the species I would have to have a six foot long... (pause) it is not funny!!
i respectfully disagree.
i can not believe you put that on my alumni page!
who cares? nobody reads those things
you would better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today.
i do not have a page.
oh oh oh! i respectfully disagree!!
look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. (he picks up hugsy) it is okay, emma, you stay asleep. (emma cries)
(threatening joey with a scrunchy): step away from the crib, i have a weapon!
it is okay, it is okay rach, it is me. put down the scrunchy.
what are you doing?
well, i heard emma stirring, so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy.
oh, oh thanks. alright well, now that I am up I am going to go to the bathroom.
(placing hugsy back in the crib) there you go sweetie... (to emma) this is not over.
alright, wait a second, why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... (reads from the screen) "gay as the day is long"?
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
but that is clearly a joke. this could easily be true. (phone rings)
would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.
(on the phone) hello? no, he is not here. yeah, this is his wife. yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. i guess i should have known. yeah, i mean, he just kept making me watch moulin rouge.
hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie! (monica hangs up) I am so going to get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go (starts typing something).
what are you doing?
oh, you will see my friend.
(visibly upset) I am dead?
(faking sympathy) and so young.
posting that i died? that really is not funny.
well, how you died was funny.
oh please, hit by a blimp?
it kills over one americans every year.
unbelievable, my classmates are going to think I am dead, my professors, my... my parents are going to get phone calls. you are messing with people's feelings here.
you want to talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i would not be able to go with him to key west!
you have really crossed the line here, but that is okay, it is ok because I am on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. that is right! your coming out is about to get real graphic.
god, i wish mike were here.
okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
what are you, animals? it is 4 of the clock in the afternoon!
i got to call him. just to talk to him, there is no harm in that.
phoebe, that is how it starts. i do not need to eat the cake, I will just smell the icing... why do not i just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. and next thing you know, you are 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. phoebe, honey, i know this is hard. look, if you talk to him, you are going to want to see him. and if you see him, you are going to want to get back together with him. i know that is not what you want. (pause) give me your phone.
here.
and now your cell.
okay (she takes a huge, clearly obsolete cellphone she keeps in a closet and gives it to monica)
this is your cellphone?
yes.
this is your current cellphone?
yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
phoebe, where is your purse?
no, no! give it to me!
you can not have it.
give it to me!
no (tucks it in her pants)
I will go in there.
(disbelievingly) oh yeah.
phoebe come here
haha!
damn you monica geller hyphen bing!
hey, look who is here! it is joey, and he brought home a friend.
joey, emma's right here! you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
no, no, it is not a girl, it is... a brand new hugsy!
oh that is so great, now emma has two hugsy's.
no, no, emma has one hugsy, the new hugsy, huh? the other hugsy, i do not know, i guess I will just take it back.
oh you know what? when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton. oh i loved her so much, i took her everywhere, i would braid her tail...
make the transfer! (she does so)
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can not find it?
oh, no do not worry about that, i swallowed that years ago.
oh, i do not think she likes the new hugsy.
but he is the same.
yeah, i think she wants the old one back.
but he is the same.
joey, come on!
he is the same!
(to the new hugsy) you are not the same!
haha!
you know, it is a lot less surprising to do that after I have buzzed you into the building.
so phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
those are my shoes.
oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me, but I am actually feeling a lot better. yeah, i just kind of want to be alone right now.
who is that? (goes to open door)
i ordered chinese food.
what are the chances? 1 billion chinese people and they send mike!?
(to mike) what are you doing here?
phoebe!
I am sorry, i broke down... i wanted to see him.
damnit phoebe! how did you even call him?
there is a speakerphone on the base unit...
base unit! think monica! think!
(to mike) this does not concern you!!
look, guys, you can not do this, it is just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
not if nothing happens. why can not... why can not we just hang out as friends?
sure! if you are just going to hang out as friends, then maybe I will join ya. you know, I am your friend (to phoebe) and mike's friend (mike is sceptical).
sit down.
oh wow wow wow!! make room for your friend! (sits herself down between them)
I have been pretty good!
thanks, you look good too.
oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. keep it clean!
so how is the piano playing going?
I have missed you too.
you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up. and then a pigeon ate it!
hey, ross, i just wanted to apologize... (­looks at laptop screen)..do not tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
uhu uhu, check this out. (chandler sits down and looks at laptop screen)
huh! so that is what i would look like if i worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. you are not actually going to send these out are ya?
eh..actually no, i do not need to because your little "ross is dead" joke did not work, ok, there were no responses. nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I am dead. (silence) oh my god! nobody cares that I am dead!?
no, come on, you know that is not true.
what are you talking about? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! i did not get one response! and I am dead!
well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
i can not believe this. not even my geology lab partner? and i carried that guy! (gets up from his sofa)
alright look, let us think about this, ok, do you really think that people are going to stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are going to post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you are dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
you are right. there is not a decent outlet.
right, i mean, come on, I am sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
exactly!! (sits back down at his laptop and starts typing)
ross, what are you... what are you... what are you doing? (looks at laptop screen)you are having a memorial service for yourself!?
no! that would be stupid! you are having it for me!
ross, do not press send, do not press se... !
oh, too late, too late! it is sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
I am trying to put emma down for a nap, have you seen hugsy?
original or crappy?
original.
no, sorry have not seen him.
then what is that big lump under your covers?
it is monica, ok?
that is not monica!
alright!! fine! it is original hugsy! no, now i know that emma wants him but he is mine and i need him..
(to herself) oh god.
... she is being unreasonable!
(yelling) joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much (joey covers hugsy's ears) oh do not cover its ears! (stops yelling) it is because it reminds her of her uncle joey!
it does?
yeah! and she is comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much.
really? she... she loves me?
oh yeah! but you know what? if you need hugsy, do not worry. emma will totally understand. i will not... but whatever (she leaves the room).
ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, i mean rach, i mean if if... . if hugsy means that much to emma then... well she can have him.
oooh... you are sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up. (turns to face emma in the the playpen) look emma, look who is baaack!
look forget it forget it... i can not do it.
are you going to... you are going to take hugsy away from a little child?
how do you think i got him in the first place?
alright you two, I am going to go to the bathroom. now i do not want anything going on while I am gone. here is a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it.
i know, i want that too, but is that going to make it too hard?
(running back into the room) kiss him, you fool!!
what?
did not you hear that speech? if you do not kiss him then i will!
oh, i missed you so much! (she kisses mike)
who is this?
hi, that is what I am doing for phoebe!
excuse me?
hey, at least i knew where my guy was.
you did not hear the speech!
hey, it was very moving! you are just heartless!
you are... weird!
oh (realizes her pants are undone and zips them up)!
damn it!
and i blame you too.
it is been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! i tell you, when i actually die some people are going to get seriously haunted!
there you go! someone came!
ok, ok! I am going to go hide! oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner! (he hides in the bedroom and closes the door)
hi, glad you could come.
(in a mournful voice) please, come in.
oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps (he goes in the bedroom)
who is he?
some guy, tom gordon.
i do not remember him, but then again i touched so many lives. (they press their ears against the door)
so, did you know ross well?
(a bit surprised) yes, he is. me.
(entering, very upset) ok tommy, that is enough mourning for you! here we go, bye bye!! (he shoves him out the door)
ok! (shuts the door behind tom)
(coming in) I am dead and no one cares?
i look like a man??
please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
it is not ridiculous, look around! no one's here!
you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it is probably the way you stand!
yes, you are right. still somebody must have seen it... i mean, i went to that school for 4 years, i did not have an impact on anyone?
oh, that is not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it is 15 years later and we are still best friends. does not that count for something?
(sceptical) yeah...
I am sure it is somebody for you. now, go hide. (ross hides in the bedroom again)
kori? kori weston?
wow! you look amazing!
chandler, chandler bing. I am not gay, I am not gay at all.
you are married though.
do not listen to him, he is in a really bad mood! (let us her in)
i did not know ross and you were so close.
I am sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, I am sure he is pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
(he bounds into the lounge room) but you did not! I am still alive!! kori, i know this is a big surprise for you. it is a long story but the things you just said really made my day! i mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
did you hear that? kori weston had a crush on me!!
(on the phone) no mum, I am not dead. i know it is not something to kid about. it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it is over, ok? (pause) actually no, even if i had died, you would not be left childless. (pause) monica?hey!
I am sorry I am late, did i miss anything?
joey stuffing 15 oreos in his mouth. (joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)
15? (joey nods again) your personal best! (ross takes an oreo and joey mumbles, no!)
where were you?
oh, on a date. yeah, i met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
oh, yeah! how did you meet her?
oh, which museum?
(just phoebe) no, answer his.
okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and i sat near the door, so she would have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. she was totally at my mercy.
were you so late because you were burring this woman?
no, I am getting back down ‘because she lives in poughkeepsie. she seems really great, but she is like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
how can she be great if she is from poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) that joke would have killed in albany.
done! i did it! heh, who is stupid now? (he smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)
hey, look at this! (holding a newspaper) they are lighting the big christmas tree tonight.
umm, that paper’s two weeks old.
all right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! i really wanted to take kathy to this, i can not believe i missed it.
hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! i hate being alone this time of year! next thing you know it will be valentine’s day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they are lighting that damn tree again. ohh, i want somebody! (hearing this, gunther moves in) y’know, i want a man!! (gunther leaves depressed) i mean, it does not even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.
really?! i did not think girls ever just wanted a fling.
well, believe me, it is been a long time since I have been flung.
well, i know what I am giving you for christmas.
y’know what? there is some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?
yeah! wait a minute, it is been a long time that I have been single. how come you never offered this before?
well, i have a girlfriend, I am-I am happy. so, i no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
okay! no accountants. oh, and no one from like legal. i do not like guys with boring jobs.
oh and ross was like what? a lion tamer?
what is wrong mon?
ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
oh.
i thought i was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, i get off work and i find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chef’s hat. (the hat says ‘quit, bitch’)
hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘quiet, bitch.’
hey, honey! what is the matter? (monica shows her, her hat.) fine, i was just trying to be nice! whoa!
i mean i have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (joey laughs and monica glares at him.)
ohhh!
i mean they are trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, i would. but this is something I have been waiting for my whole life.
well, wait a minute, you are the boss! why do not you just yell at them? or, fire them?
i would love too, but i can not! i mean i just can not, you know that I am not good at confrontation.
hey, you know what you can do? i remember reading about this director, i think it was orson wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. then they would all know, who is boss.
hey, mon! I am not doing anything, why do not you fire me?
that is a good idea! wait, do you know how to waiter?
good enough to get fired.
all right, you are hired!
hey! that must be why i got fired last week! does this orson wells guy direct burger king commercials?
(he glares at him for a while) yes.
i say, drew! are you seeing anybody right now? (drew looks at him) og-ee-op, I am not asking for me, I am… i mean… no, I am-I am not gay, I am not asking you out. I am not-I am not-I am not gay!
see my friend-my friend, rachel, she wants to be set up.
oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with rachel.
(to drew) oh, by the way, that is her full name.
oh well, that is uh, a little later than i uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
well, i do not really know what that is, but let us!!
hey! you guys, I am writing a holiday song for everyone. do you want to hear it?
(singing) happy chanukah, monica! may your christmas be snowy, joey! happy new year, chandler and ross. spin the draddle, rachel!
pheebs, that is great!
oh, yay!
but y’know umm, rachel does not rhyme with draddle.
i know but it is so hard! nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
what are you talking about? lots of things rhyme with rachel. bagel. mail. jail. bail. able. may-pole.
all good, thanks. (to rachel) do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that is easier to rhyme?
did not your dad used to call you pumpkin?
oh yeah!
pumpkin? yeah. but did he ever call you like, budolph?
(entering) hello, children!
(to rachel) have i got the 50 guys for you!
really?!
oh yeah, i just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! they are buying me drinks! they are giving me stuff! (to joey) knicks tonight?
sure! where are the seats?
wherever! I have got like 20!
so, will i like any of these guys?
y’know what, I am going to uh, play the field just a little more.
chandler!
guys are signing over their 401-k’s to me?
(shocked) you work with robots!!
(pause) yes. (to rachel) okay, there is this one guy, patrick, i think you are going to like him, he is really nice, he is funny, he is a swimmer.
ohh, i like swimmer’s bodies!
yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
op, i like credit cards!
see, I am not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
well, so what does he do?
oh, he works in the fine foods division.
your company has a fine foods division?
it is a big company, i do not—if you—i…
now, wait a second! you make food and robots?
no! no, the robots just work for them.
(getting up) all right, I am going to go to work. does anybody have a problem with that?
yeah, lady, i do! i got a problem with that!
you want a problem? I will give you a problem!
oh, what are you going to do? you are going to fire me?
you bet your ass, I am going to fire you! thank you.
oh, wow! i should get going. i-i got a date tonight.
oh yeah! with who?
you know that girl i told you about who lives up in poughkeepsie?
yeah.
not her. yeah, this is someone else i meet, and i-i can not decide between the two of them. y’know the one from poughkeepsie, even though she is a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. but this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. y’know she is, well she is-she is just as pretty, i guess she is smart, she is not fun.
if she is no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
well, i-i want to give her another chance, y’know? she lives so close. and, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. on the other hand, if she was not kidding, she is not fun, she is stupid, and kind of a racist.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey, man!
hey! ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
(checks his watch) damn! (runs out to work)
(entering from the dining room) hey.
hey.
hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? (sees there is a burn spot on it)
they baked it. i can not take this anymore. I am going to call a meeting tonight, I am going to fire you tonight.
you got it! oh-oh! (he starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)
what are you doing?!
it is still a tiny bit on fire there.
thanks. (joey’s still patting the burn spot) i think you got it!
(entering) chandler!! you have the best taste in men!
well, like father, like son.
patrick and i had such a great time last night! i mean i think this could maybe turn into something serious.
really?! i-i thought you were not looking for something serious? i thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
well, y'know, possibly. (pause) you did not tell him that, though? right?
ummmmmmmm, no.
you told this guy that i was looking for a fling?! you do not tell the guy that!
why not?! I would be thrilled if i heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh i see.
oh, between you telling him that i wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he is so going to get the wrong idea.
hey, joey, could you pass the cheese?
yeah. listen uh, I would prefer it if you did not call me joey. since i do not know anyone here, i thought it would be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
(opening an envelope) there is like-there is like 300 bucks in this one!
okay. could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? okay, first there is a chilean sea bass prepared with a mango relish on a bag—why is nobody writing these down?
because your all going to make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
okay, forget the specials for a minute. umm, all right here is the thing, for the last two weeks i have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…
(louder) a positive atmosphere! but i-i-i have had it up to here. (she holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) from now on, it is going to be my way, or the highway! all right? does anybody have a problem with that?!! (joey looks at the money he is holding, and does not speak up.) hey new guy! i said, does anybody have a problem with that?!
no madam.
what the hell happened?!
i am so-so-so sorry. i was going to do it! really! but i was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and i was thinking, "wow! it is been a long time since i had… (tries to do the math in his head, but can not) 327 + 238 dollars!"
joey, we had a deal. that-that is why you are here! I have got to fire you!
and i got to pay rent! look, how-how about this? you do not fire me, instead i stay here, i gain their trust, and they will start listening to all the nice things I have been saying about you.
what kind of things have you been saying?
well nothing yet, they really hate you and i want to fit in.
(singing) happy, happy chanukah, chandler and monica. very merry…
(interrupting) oh, y’know, y’know what pheebs?
what?
I am not jewish, so…
so! ross does not really decorate his tree with floss, but you do not hear him complaining do you? god! (phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up ross with a start.)
bad dream?
i was not sleeping.
oh yeah, then uh, what was phoebe’s song about?
the one with the cat. i got to go, I have got another date.
so, did you pick one yet?
no, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. but it was a different joke than i thought—it was not that funny. so I am still torn.
well look, you do not really like the one from uptown and you are too exhausted from dating the one up in poughkeepsie, so i say you just end them both. okay? you take a train up to poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. and then by the time you get home tonight, you are done!
y’know, you are right. thank you.
umm, well i had a similar problem when i lived in prague.
prague?
there is sooo much you do not know.
chandler! patrick just uh, ended things with me. did you or did you not tell him that i was looking for a serious relationship?
i did! i absolutely did!
you idiot!!
I am sure you are right, but why?
you do not tell a guy that you are looking for a serious relationship! you do not tell the guy that! now you scared him away!
oh, man. I am sorry, I am so-so sorry.
y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!
i know! i know!
oh! see just I am right back where i started! aww, this sucks! being alone, sucks! (she sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)
well, y’know, you are-you are going to meet somebody! you are a great catch! y’know when i was telling all those guys about you, i did not have to lie once. (he sits down on the arm of her chair)
really?
yeah! you graduated magma ku laude, right?
no.
oh, it does not matter. (kisses her on the top of her head.) hey, y’know what, I have got two tickets to tonight’s rangers game, you want to come with me?
cute guys in little shorts? sure.
well, actually it is a hockey team, so it is angry canadians with no teeth.
well that sounds fun too. (they hug.)
have you ever been with a woman?
what?! chandler, what is the matter with you?!
so there is no good time to ask that question.
i need more swordfish. (to one of the assistant chefs) can you get me some more swordfish?
you did a minute ago!
fine!
okay! very funny! somebody let me out please?! come on, I am cold! (she spills something.) and covered in marinara sauce! come on! let me out! (the door opens)
that is not funny.
(starting to cry) I am a good person. and I am a good chef, and i do not deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…
(interrupting) hey! chef geller! y’know that little speech you made the other day? well i got a problem with it!
you do?
you bet i do! i just ah, was not listening then, that is all.
well if you want a problem? I will give you a problem!
what are you going to do? you are going to fire me?
you bet your ass I am going to fire you! get out of my kitchen! get out!! (joey leaves) all right! anybody else got a problem? how ‘bout you chuckles? you think this is funny now?
how about if i dance around all covered in sauce? huh? you think it is funny now?
good! now, take those salads to table 4, (to the kitchen worker from earlier) and you! get the swordfish! (to another assistant chef) and you! get a haircut!
(waking up) what? (notices that there is now a beautiful woman sitting next to him)
what?
(now fully awake) are we really in montreal?!
coffee sounds great. (they get up) wait, so, so you live in montreal?
well i guess i should have thought about my wife and kids before i talked back to chef geller!
thanks.
yep! looks like it is going to be a leeeeean christmas at the dragon house this year.
enough!
(leaving) lean-lean-lean!
(singing) "went to the store, sat on santa's lap.
so, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
this bottle opener. (she grabs it off of the freezer door.)
and?
and it is a magnet!
look at that!
how weird is that? y’know? you are moving in with me and have the one thing i do not have. it is like uh, in a way you-you complete me (phoebe glares at him) kitchen.
what?!
(in an australian accent) you complete me kitchen, matey!
ross, i know what you are thinking.
what?
that she is going to move in with you and maybe then she will fall in love with you and then when she finds out you are already married, she will just be happy. y’know? you are just, you are very sad.
oh…my…god! i-i see what this is! you are in love with rachel!
what?!!
of course! it all adds up! i mean you you are obsessed with her. it is always, "ross, what are you going to do about rachel?" "ross, why-why are you moving in with rachel?" "when are you going to confess your secret marriage to rachel?" you want her!
no! (ross’s phone rings.)
(answering it) uh-oh, saved by the bell. (on phone) hello?
hey rach, are not these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?
no-no, i bought those.
ohh! yeah, i forgot.
yeah. (rachel walks away.)
(under her breath) that you are a liar. (hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)
(on phone) no-no-no, that is great! I will be there monday. and thank you again! (listens) okay. (hangs up) (to all) umm, that was the head of the paleontology department at n uh, y, uh you!
wow! uh what, did he uh, say?
well remember that paper i had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? they loved it.
well, who would not?!
i know! anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! i mean it is temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. how great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "professor geller."
yeah, professor and mrs.
and mrs.?!
oh! yeah, y’know you and ross are still married.
what?!!
just kidding!
ohh! oh god! (laughs her way into the living room.)
(to ross) saved your ass.
hey!
hi.
hey!
oh, what is the matter?
well, you know that psychic i see?
yeah?
well, she told me that I am going to die this week, so I am kind of bummed about that.
what?!
yeah, and i know you guys do not know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
phoebe that is crazy!
i can not believe she would say that too you.
yeah honey you do not believe her do you?
i do not—she said y’know that I would have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black.
just out of curiosity did she tell you how you are going to go?
no, ‘because she did not tell me i was going to die until the very end of the session, and i was not going to waste a whole another hour there! i mean I have only got a week left, y’know? I have really got to start living now! (so she picks up the latest copy of car and driver (a you.s. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)
(entering) hey everyone!
oh hi!
hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and i kind of wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
(he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) "there are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…"
oh, this is it. this what is going to kill me.
(continuing) "…subcategories. the first of these subcategories is…"
(interrupting him) uh ross! are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
no! why?
well, I have just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that did not have naked chicks on it.
ohh! okay! okay. (resumes reading word for word from the card) "there are three (pauses and looks at joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (pauses and darts his eyes between chandler and rachel.) (rachel starts laughing) each of these theories (glances at phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at chandler) into…"
why do not you open with a joke?
open with a joke? it is a university, not a comedy club!
wait a minute, hold the phone! you are not talking about chuckles university?!
(gets up) okay!
ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
thank you!
some uh, some visual aides.
oh-ooh-ooh! y’know what is a good visual aide?
please do not say naked chicks.
why not?!
i-i-i do not even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it. y’know what? I am just going to do it on my own with no naked chicks.
that is the way i did it ‘til i was 19.
hey.
hey! any good mail?
yes, you got something from the screen actor’s guild.
ooh, it is probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I am kind of….
(opens and reads it) "benefits lapsed."
hmm that is weird. i do not remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
okay, it is not a check. they are saying your health insurance expired because, you did not work enough last year.
let me see that!
all right.
(reads it) oh, i can not believe this! this sucks! when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? and it would not matter. now i got to be careful?!
I am sorry man, there is never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
all right well, i guess i got to go get a job. I am going to go see my agent.
okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
(mocks him, in a whiney voice) …look both ways before you cross the street. (turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)
hey!
hey pheebs, you are still alive! how are you doing?
ugh, it is so exhausting waiting for death. ohh, by the way, do you think you could—(groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)
pheebs, what-what are you doing?
i was preparing you for my—did not you think i was dead? did that not come off?
oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. i thought we would lost you forever. pheebs, you lie down?
yeah, thanks. and listen, can you do me a favor? could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.
monica!
hmm? (rachel holds up the candlesticks.)
did-did you take these back?
no-no, i-i just, i liked them so much that i went out and bought some for myself.
oh yeah, they are really great! are not they?
i loved them!
yeah. (monica walks away) nice try! (rachel puts them in a box.)
(entering) hello!
hey!
hey!
how did the lecture go?
it went great! and i did not need any jokes or naked chicks either!
wow, that is great ross, I am sorry we were not more supportive before.
i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself. everyone is all, "ross you have to be funny and sexy." well, i proved them wrong! and now, I am going to pass the news onto joey and chandler.
that you are not funny or sexy?
that is right!
(entering) hey estelle, listen…
what are you talkin’ about? i never left you! you have always been my agent!
yeah!
estelle, you got to get me some work. i-i lost my health insurance.
why?
bastard!
hey!
(in obvious pain) hey! so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I will have my health insurance back in no time.
that is great, but should not you be on the toilet right now?
what?!
what is wrong with you?
nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, have not been able to stand up since. but um, i do not think it is anything serious.
this sounds like a hernia. you have to—you-you go to the doctor!
no way! ‘kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it is going to be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (rolls over and shows chandler.)
that is a hernia.
why did i have to start working out again? (looks at the weights he was using.) damn you 15s!
well, we are a little early, the lecture does not end for 15 minutes.
yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.
yeah, we could. oh hey look! there is some kappa kappa deltas! i was a kappa. (to them) hey sisters! (they ignore her.) (to monica) wow, we really are bitches.
(to the class) right! so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! what he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. imagine his consternation when—(sees monica and rachel.) oh bloody hell.
what the hell are you doing?!
look, i was nervous! you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring! i got up there and they were all like staring at me. i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out.
yeah, and not a very good one.
will you-will you please?
oh.
(in his british accent) I am sorry, I have got plans with my sister.
(in an irish accent) monica gellerrr. (she rolls her ‘r’)
(in accent) right, will you excuse us for one moment? (takes monica aside.) (in his normal voice.) what are you doing?
(normal voice) oh, you can have an accent and i can not?! (to an exiting student in accent.) top ‘of the morning to ya laddies!
just please stop!
(in an indian accent) yes, yes, bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
hey, will you grab me a cruller? (joey starts to groan and get up.) sit down! will you go to the hospital?!
dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides it is getting darker and more painful, that means it is healing.
i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and let us just get that thing…pushed back in.
thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i do not want that hanging over my head. okay? besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want! yeah, I am thinking I will probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
hey!
hey.
hey!
what is going on?
oh joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that is nothing a little laser eye surgery will not fix!
look, I am telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here (he puts his hand down his pants, like al bundy on married…with children always used to do.) it does not hurt that bad.
hey! maybe you will die!
sure, now I am scared.
no, we can go together! just do not wait too long though, okay? ‘because I am outta here sometime before friday.
yeah, but i do not want to die!
no-no, it will be fun! we can come back and we can haunt these guys!
give me ‘them!
no! they are mine!
you stole them from me!
you stole them from me!!
give me them!
you just want to each take one?
yeah that seems fair. we never use them.
(entering) look, i really need some help, okay? why? why did i have to speak in a british accent?! what do i do?
well…
why do not you phase it out? yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you are, y’know, that you are adjusting to life in america.
yeah, i mean, come on ross, no one will even notice. i mean they are probably not even listening!
they are not listening too me?
of course they are listening to you! everybody listens to you.
monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing?
i think you look fine.
(in a gravely, painful voice) okay. "hey, timmy, I have got a surprise for you."
oh yeah, sure, no problem, I will just—hold on one second. (he turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (in a relaxed voice.) "hey timmy, I have got a surprise for you!"
so that is why i feed my dog purina one! pick up a bag today! (he turns, looks at the bag and realizes he will not be able to pick it up.)
exactly.
or, i could just point to it! huh? blah, blah, blah, purina one, point to a bag today. (she just looks at him.) i did not get it, did i?
yeah, okay. (leaves)
hi. I am joey tribbiani; I am here to audition for (groans) man.
yes!
okay, come on, do it one more time!
really? really?!
yes!
okay! (picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (in an irish accent) "hello ross, this is dr. mcneeley from the fake accent university, we would like you to come on board with us full time! (hangs up.)
(entering) hey!
hey!
listen to this! my reading was wrong, I am not going die!
really?! how do you know?
because my psychic is dead! she must have read the cards wrong!
oh, I am sorry.
eh, better her than me! hey, let us bake cookies!
listen, I am really glad you got the part.
(barely audible through the pain) thank you.
but are you sure you can do this?
yeah! and hey, thanks for coming with me. and thanks again for helping me take a shower.
now, is that never talking about it again?!
(to the director) hiya!
hi alex! (to the director) and uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (holds them both up.)
"take could care of your momma son." (alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "take could care of your momma son." (alex does nothing.) "come on son! your momma’s good people!"
ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if i, if i scream right up until you say action?
okay. (starts screaming.)
(he stops screaming at action) "take good care of your momma son." (again alex does nothing.)
I am sorry! hey-hey joe, why do not you uh, lift up your shirt? (he does.) take a look at this kiddo. (alex finally starts crying.) we have a crying child! roll the damn cameras!
(answering it) hello?
uh no, he is not. can i take a message?
ross got married again—nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
(in his head) all right, keep going. we are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. so without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the british way) the team would never have identified (british) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (british). were there any questions at this point? (one student raises his hand.) yes. (points to him.)
(british) come again? what is-what is this nonsense? (giggles.) (american.) all right, I am-I am not english. I am from long island. i was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. I am sorry. so, if we could just get back to the lecture. umm, were there any questions? (everyone raises their hands) about paleontology. (they all put their hands down.) all right, look i was just trying to make a good first impression. obviously, i screwed up. but what you guys think of me is really important because I am-I am hoping to get a permanent job here. so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…
ross!! are you crazy?! i am still your wife!! what, were you just never going to tell me?!! what the hell is wrong with you?!!!! ugh, i could just kill you!!!!
(in the accent again) well, hello rachel!
have you really done this before?
yeah! yeah! yeah! you just take a big, big swing. now, do not hold back. (he dons his protective helmet (why, i have no clue.) and phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as chandler and monica enter.)
hey!
hey-hey-hey!
what are you doing?
we are just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.
oh, all right.
hey!
yeah! yeah! ok! sure! look! can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who ever
ok you...you really do not know what i am talking about?
no!
ok! last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
our balcony? seriously? that is so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said
right that is why i came over to talk about. hum...i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,
so are you going to...talk to her?
why...why should i? i mean if she wants to move on, that is fine!
you know when "that is fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
no I am serious. i mean she wants to date people? fine! i do not care but...at least she could have told me. you know
no no no. good. so you are moving on? do you have any idea where you are moving?
i do not know. i mean i have plenty of opportunity. just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
dude, do not rub my face in your crazy single life!
well, and how about this? there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
why did i get married?!
hey! let me ask you guys something. i have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks i
well it depends.
on...?
on how far along he is in the sex change process!
no i totally disagree. no i think it is fine for a guy to do something like that. such you an actor. not that you need to,
ok! stop it you guys! stop staring! you are freaking me out!
your knuckles are kind of hairy too...
oh man! i have to get those done too?!
wow! talking about high maintenance
hey hey! you dye your hair!
I am a woman!
arghhh! double standards!
oh before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight?
only if i do not have to get up and sing.
but everybody sings. it is so much fun! last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out
it is just, I am not good at singing.
oh! what is the matter? are you scared? you are afraid I am a better singer? you are afraid I am going to beat you at singing?
no no, it is not working on me. wow! i must be growing up!
ok fine! please come and support mike. you do not have to sing.
so i do not have to sing and i can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
while drinking...
I am there!
hi guys! listen i really need your help. i think i did something really stupid.
well yes rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
no not that. i kissed gavin last night.
oh my god.
you kissed him?
yeah. it was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
wait wait wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i missed that?
it was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
oh yeah...so how did you end up kissing?
you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
i thought you hated him?
you know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
so are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
i do not know. it is so complicated. i work with this guy, you know, i have the baby, and i have ross, and i just...i do not
sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to gavin, and you definitely should talk to ross
or...i could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
wow! five-month maternity leave, you are back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
hey. I am here for my eyebrow appointment.
chandler bing.
ok thanks.
thanks. do you get a lot of guys in here?
oh good...
all right let us just do this.
please i have an extremely high threshold...holly mother of god! my face! my face!! I am all right! I am all right!
hey it is the most eligible man in ny. how is the moving on going?
not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
well maybe you are going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,
that is funny...do you think you will ever work again?
what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!
i can not believe rachel just moved on and did not say anything to me
maybe she did not move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
no no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
did she go out with him?
no. when he called, i...i threw the message away.
ah! the high road...
you know what? enough! enough talking! i have to get moving! hey check out those two blondes over there!
are you trying to get everybody divorced?
you do not have to do anything. it will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? you...you break the
i thought i had to make the jokes!
do not you have to be at work?
oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here is my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you are up for it.
hum...so...hum...oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in europe? here�s a question: "would you...
we still got it!
who is it?
why?
oh! right! yeah! hold on, I will be just clean up in here a little bit! hello gavin
i a not going to lie to you, I am pretty sick
oh no no no
so did i
it is just a cold
what? what is the matter?
oh he is dusting me with a fossil brush. he thought it would be funny.
oh you are not. you are not going to get in the middle of anything, do not worry about ross really, really.
i lied! and I am not sick! just stay behind the curtain!
oh! molly! you are not ross.
right, right, yes!
what?
no! that is ok! that is ok! that is ok! no no no no! this is my business associate gavin. he is just being silly.
ok.
i thought it was ross.
there is not. there is totally is not.
all right. look. gavin...i...i guess i felt guilty that you were here, which i should not. you know ross and i are not in
yes
people keep saying that. oh I am sorry gavin
so seriously...rodeo clown?
"no time for losers, because we are the champions of the world...!" thank you!
hi hi...oh you have got to sing.
no i told you i can not.
but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
what have you heard me sing?
all the time when you are cooking.
what?
yeah you are always singing "yummy yummy yummy, I have got love in my tummy"
yeah i do rock that one.
ok so is not there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
just a little but...it is just so scary! i do not even know what i would sing...
"delta dawn"
hi! i could help not notice, but that is an unusual necklace
right, so that is a firm "no". i cannot believe this, i just keep striking out.
i do not get it neither, i mean you are obviously desperate, you are asking women how they want to be killed
this is great. rachel's going to keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I am going to die alone.
by drowning or...?!
well...
i know! (he stands)
wait wait! i can not sing in front of all these people.
just pretend they are not even here! it is ok monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you will not see anyone
hi! I am monica and I am going to be singing "delta dawn"
can you totally see through her shirt ?
"to take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
hey, i need your help.
wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?
look, I will get new headshot taken, all right, so i want to get my eyebrows shaped
i am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
you may be a sissy but I will still (pound you out on ground). all right, it hurts so bad, i could only let her do one
it�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
all right, look, you got to help me out, ok? look, i have the magic marker, i want you to fill in the skinny one so
ok. first of all, this is green!
what the hell am i supposed to do!
all right, i will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what i am about to tell you.
what, what.
ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mine
oh my god!
yeah, well, i guess you don�t need my help victor victoria!
ok all right, no, no, no, no, i do, i do, i do, i need your help, but chandler i don�t know if i can take anymore
oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
"take me to the mansion in the sky-y". i am sorry, the song is over. did you see me out there?
every little bit of you!
i can�t believe i did this. i can�t believe I am singing for the people, and they liked me! hey, did you hear that
mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...
good? didn�t you hear them...i was great! thank you so much for making me do this. that�s is the best gift ever.
but, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
uh-ah!
(pfew). good choice ross.
oh, hey! hi, there you are, i�ve been looking for you everywhere!
oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here i am.
listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine of� clock. so i was hoping you and i could have a
oh, yeah, yeah that�s michelle.
who?
oh, just this woman i�ve been seeing.
you�ve being seeing someone?
yeah, didn�t i mention that? yeah, i mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this
how great is this? you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. oh, i am sorry michelle, that�s
hi, and i am also emma�s mother.
i told you about my daughter.
and done!
oh my god! i didn�t feel a thing ! hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around
thanks. you want to see what it looks like?
yeah, yeah. hey, they totally match! they look great! they look great! how you doing!
yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right about
thank you so much.
no problem.
listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
yeah.
comb my eyelashes.
ok, for my next song i think i�ll sing something a little more upbeat. all right? oh, how about the pointer
oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
i am sorry i am late. you�ll understand when you�ll see joey.
honey, you�re just in time, i�m about to sing another song!
really? in front of all this people?
and they love me!
oh my god!
yes, she gives the people what they want.
all right, watch!
"tonight's the night we are going to make it happen, tonight we will put all other things aside. give in this
are those my wife�s nipples?
oh? isn�t that funny? i did not see that before, i would not have let her go up again.
i got to stop this.
oh, who cares, they still love me! "i am so excited..."
you, touching yourself, out!
wow. she does that a lot!
what, what, wait a minute! you haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? how long have you known her, like
i told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
are you kidding?
we�ll see.
ok, ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
i don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
how do you know about that?
through the magic of sight! i was here, putting our child to sleep...
when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know, for what? a week?
oh, that�s what this is all about? did you bring her up here to get back at me?
ok, michelle, it�s time to go.
ok.
you know, if it�s meant to be, i�ll guess it. bye, bye.
score.
oh, i am sorry, did you not like her, because i was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
oh god, i can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. it was one kiss, one guy, one time!
oh, really!
yeah.
oh, really!
oh yeah.
what about the guy from the bar?
what? who?
the guy you gave your number to.
whoa, how do you know about that?
because he called here looking for you. so don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,
why didn�t i get that message?
what?
from the guy in the bar, why didn�t i get that message?
because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket. do you...do you not look there?
ross?
i never gave it to you.
why?
i don�t know.
oh god. you know what? who you think you are? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get?
who am i?
yes.
i am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
oh my god, i cannot believe this. you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you
none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! that�s not the point. ok? the point is you...you are the one
oh, ross, this is just so messed up! what�s wrong with us? you know when people hear about our situation they
uh, clearly.
and you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. an maybe this, you know,
yeah, maybe not. so what you want to do?
hey!
hi. can emma and i live here for a while?
ha, oh, of course.
thank you.
your eyebrows look weird.
�jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped him
(talking to a pineapple in his hand) god, you are beautiful...why are we fighting this?you know you want it to happen as much as i do.
i want you.i need you.let me make love to you.
i do not want to stand in the way of true love or anything, but i think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
oh, ehm...I am...I am rehearsing my lines.they gave me a big romantic story on days of our lives. it is the first time my character's got one. I am so nervous, you know, i really want it to be good!
woow!i have not seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were going to be with a real talking dog!
yeah, that was a disappointment...(pause) oh, hey!d'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I am doing ok?
(excited) are you serious?
yeah!hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
hey, that was an honest mistake!
right!(he starts to ape her)"oh my god, is this the men's room? oh, i feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?" (he inclines his head as if to look at a man's private parts)
yeah, that was an awesome day!
hey!
hey!
hi!
so, do you guys want to come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
sure!
I would love to!
well you can not! we are booked solid for the next month!
well, i can not give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
phoebe, what happened?
well, it was an accident...you know, it is a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
(to monica) have i got a surprise for you? pack your bags!
oh no!you guys are not supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
what? no, I am taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont (shows them a brochure)!
oh, good!ok, good for you!try to recapture the magic!
so, what do you say? can you get out of work?
oh, honey!i can not. i was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
are you really that busy?
yeah, I am sorry. i really am.
oh, that is ok.I will just try and reschedule. (on the phone) "hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there and i need to change it (pause) oh, what do you mean it is not refundable? can i just come some other time? (pause) oh, can not you make an exception?"
tell them I am a chef in a big new york restaurant!
and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
(on the phone) "look, this is ridiculous! I am not paying for that room! ok?" (pause) "oh, thank you very much!" (hangs up) yeah, I am going to vermont...
oh, do not worry about it! just use your travel insurance.
i do not have travel insurance.
well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
why do not you take ross?
uh, do not you think that would be a little weird? i mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
no, not if their room has two beds!
(browsing the brochure) i guess...it still seems a little...(enthusiastically) moonlight boat ride!!
hey joey, is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity?
i do not know, but one of the extras sure did! (pause) hey, listen rach. thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
oh, please!honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I am...oh my god!is that christian sanders?he is so gorgeous!
also so gay!
oh, in my head he is done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
well, at the christmas party him and santa did some definitely gay stuff!
oh, wish me luck!
ok, not that you need it but good...god!is that chase lassiter?he is straight, right?
rach, i got to say...if you were not here wondering if these guys were gay i do not know if i could do this!
oh, I am sorry, you are right.I am sorry, good luck! (they hug)
(watching a television where the scene is shown, startled) oh!
ssshhhhttt!!he is asking her a question!!
no! (pause) or, cut!you know, that is your call!
thank you!
thank you!(she looks at the 3rd customer waiting for a compliment) you have not said anything...
oh..please!i-i welcome criticism.
what musician?
(playing guitar and singing) and there is a country called argentinaaaa, it is a place I have never seeeeen. but I am told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. humaaan spleeeeen. oldè!
what are you doing here!
well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so i am here to entertain!
great!
yeah! it really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! yeah, "you suck" and "shut up and go home".
listen phoebe...
yeah.
you know how much i love listening to your music, you know, but...
but what?
this is kind of a classy place.
(pause) ok, say no more.
(with a fancy dress, still playing and singing): it was not just that she was fat, the woman smelled like garbage! everyone! it was not just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage! (to monica, showing her dress) classy, uh?
hi, chandler bing, i have a reservation.
new york.
(in a strange voice and eating candies) the big apple!
I am sorry, he is a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
yeah, i ate all my gifts for everybody.
well, that is impossible, can you check again, please?
(high pitched voice) check again please!
not there.
let me get this straight. i called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and i was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we do not have a reservation?
(mumbling) she does not know what to say!
just give us the cheapest room you have.
that is insane!
totally insane. dude, let us drive home, we will hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they are closed maybe we will tap a tree and make some ourselves.
does that room have a closet i can lock him in? (pause) we will take it.
(aside, to ross) what!? they are totally ripping us off!
dude, do not worry 'bout it! i know how we can make your money back! this is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! like those apples. instead of taking one, I am... i take six!
great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we are there!
c'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we will make our money back in no time!
dude, you are shaking!
i think it is the sugar, could you hold the apple?
hi!
hey!
joey, i got to tell ya, I have been thinking all day about that scene you did, i mean, you were amazing!
oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they are not as good as me!
god, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
ow, I am just going over the script now! you want to read lines with me?
me? oh, no, i am not an actress.
oh, all right, i can ask monica.
oh screw her, that part is mine!
right... (pause) ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
okay. (pause).(acting) hello drake, I am surprised to see you here.
(pause) kiss me.
what?
kiss me.
ah, rach, it does not say that!
no, I am saying...
but, but..
just... do not talk... (she kisses him)
(waking up) ehhh, aw! (pause). well, that is new!
(on the phone) hi, this is ross geller in suite 206. it seems you forgot a couple of things. could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? (pause) thank you! ok. toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and i feel like i am forgetting something... is there anything else you have that i have not asked for already? (pause) yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
what did you get?
usa today
nice, put it with the others.
and i also got... two more apples.
we are four short of a bush-of (pause). god i feel so alive, i love being in the country!
i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
oh, that is not cool.
no, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. for example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. (pause) now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt (he opens the salt shaker and pours the salt into his hand) i wish I would thought this through.
i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs (goes to take the bulb)...oh, you already got that.
not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
ok, how about this (picks up the remote control)?
no, no, no, you can not take the remote control!
yes, but the batteries...
thank you, thank you very much!
let us celebrate with some maple candy!
no!
at least tell me where you hid it.
can i ask you a question?
yeah.
have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
let me think. oh, when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese, and on our wedding night i ate his head.
ok, well this is like that...in no way. i had a...i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey.
wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
oh yeah! i mean, that was pretty intense.
what do you think brought than on?
i do not know! i mean, maybe that is something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday.
a love scene? with who?
olivia.
olivia? i thought she was marrying connor! (pause) oh right, real life more important.
so do you think that my dream means anything?
i do not know. i mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you do not have a thing for joey, maybe you have a thing for drake.
ah! well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream...
of course it was! trust me, when it comes to psychology i know what I am talking about. i took two psych classes in college.
you took the same class twice.
it was hard!
hey!
here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant (she dons a top hat) uh, huh wait! (she raises a pair of spectacles to her eyes) right? i mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
oh...phoebe? maybe i was not clear before. i really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
right, yeah, ok, I will ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
phoebe, it is not what you wear. it is sort of your songs... i just do not think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
oh, ok. fine, I will just, I will take the hat back (she puts the hat in a bag and she crushes it angrily on the floor with her foot).
hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
my songs are not good enough for your restaurant?
ok, we are still on that.
i did not say your songs were not good enough.
then what is wrong with them? would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
tiny portions?
yeah well, "excuse me, i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but (peering through her spectacles) i can not see it, i can not see it"!
phoebe, it is not about quantity.
well...it is not about quality.
oh really, you want to talk about quality? have you heard of a key? it is what some people sing in.
well at least all my songs do not taste like garlic. yeah, there are other ingredients monica.
ok, so that is what we are doing. you know, when I am in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I am wearing ear plugs.
ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
you know what? i take back what i said before. you keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
what are people having, the garlic martini?
oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
oh, i did not factor in the room tax.
oh dude, do not worry about it, i found an unattended maid's car. we are way ahead of the game.
oh my god.
what?
there is something new in the bowl.
look, we have enough, just walk away.
no, but i want...i want the pinecones!
there is a forest right outside.
it is not the same.
ok, go quick!
(to the receptionist) thank you for a delightful stay.
oh, my maple candy!
(singing) food here at 'javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'javu' ...will kill you..
thank god, it is just you! i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
you would better get back in that kitchen monica, the garlic is not going to overuse itself.
ok, you have to stop playing now.
why? the only person my playing is bothering is you!
oh yeah? ok, let us settle this, come on!
(while monica drags her in the restaurant) get your garlic-peelers off me!
(to the restuarant customers) excuse me, excuse me, hi, I am monica geller..I am the head chef here.. (pauses as if waiting for something).. ok, i was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? (a few people raise their hands)
ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? (a few people raise their hands) ha!
alright, let me ask you this question: how many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? (a few raise their hands again).
ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? (a few raise their hands)
ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? (all raise their hands).
excuse us! (then to phoebe) alright here is a question: who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? (raises her hand)
oh...who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! (raises her hand)
I am sorry...
I am sorry too... (they hug)
ooohh... hey! want to stick around and I will whip you up some dinner?
yeah! as long as it is free! food here is ridiculously over-p...
(smiling, raising her hand) who is hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you will not hate me?
hey!
hey!
joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
(touches the back of his head and licks his fingers) oh man! i thought i got it all!
(looks puzzled) how...how...?
i was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
uh-huh
and i could not find this little plastic thing (holds up plastic thing) that goes on top of the blender...and i thought...well... how important can that be, right...? turns out very!
(to herself) wow...definitely just drake...
what?
what...how is it going with drake?
oh...i do not think it is going very well...
what...that scene i saw was so good!
well, I am feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you are bad so I will give you a compliment?
a little. yeah no, i really am worried, you know, i mean i have to make it convincing that I am in love with olivia.
so?
so...I have never played that!
ooh! honey, it can not be that hard, i mean, you have been in love before?
uh...well...just once...with you...
ok...this could be a little awkward...I am just going to blow past it... well can not you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
(looks at her for a moment) what the hell are you talking about??
(shakes her head) alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you are playing the scene.
(approvingly) oh! ok, yeah, i think i can do that. yeah ok, there is this party scene coming up.. and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can not... and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you did not know so i would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
(looks touched) joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
well.. hey, you know what else i could use? there is a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom, and she does not know he is there - which never happened with us! and he knows he should not be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? (in a romantic voice) and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when i would think to myself, my god, she...is... beautiful... (rachel looks very moved) and it hurts so much, cuz i knew i could never tell you (pauses, while looking at her with sentiment) but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
(excited) thanks dude!!!this is great!! (leaves rachel very touched on the couch and goes into his room)
i got you something from vermont! (sits down at the table)
(without looking up from what she is doing) besides tampons and salt? (then looks) ooh! my god! maple candy! that is so sweet of you. (opens the box) that is weird...it is empty!
(sounds excited) hi you guys! what is going on, you... you guys want to hang out...or...? (looks around the room nervously) do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?guys, hurry up! the flight leaves in four hours! it could take time to get a taxi! there could be traffic! the plane could leave early! when we get to london, there could be a line at customs! come on!! (she runs back to her apartment.)
six-hour trip to london. that is a lot of monica.
passport, check! (as she puts away each item, she says check.) camera, check! traveller’s cheques, check!
who are you saying "check" too?
myself. y’know for remembering to pack a thing. yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) my mom does it, i never realized it was weird.
yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. well, actually, she only did it the one time. but it was pretty weird.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey! are you ready yet?
yep! you got the tickets?
oh! got ‘them right here, (pats his coat pocket) check!
it is all london, baby! here we go. (he takes a picture of a less than enthused chandler and starts towards the girls’ apartment.)
you got your passport?
yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. you do not want to lose that.
ohh!! (runs to his room.)
there it is.
okay, if you need the vacuum, it is in my closet on the left-hand side. ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…
okay, okay, but rachel’s going to be here too, can not i just ask her this stuff?
yeah, okay, give that a try!
(entering, with joey) all right! let us do it!
woo-hoo!!
yeah, cheerie-of!
london baby!
okay, ‘because that is not going to get annoying.
(louder) london baby!!
hey, y’know what? i was wrong.
well, we are all here! i guess we should get going!
ohhh, i want to come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but i do not—can not get up.
oh, I will-I will come hug you.
great! yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
yeah. (he does so and phoebe hugs him.)
oh, have a great wedding!
thanks.
oh, hey, chandler i want to hug you too!
hey! (trots over)
oh, and great! you might as well bring me my book, it is on the counter in your apartment.
oh. (goes and gets phoebe’s book as rachel comes in from her room.)
(to rachel) so, we are off.
have fun!
thanks! (they hug.) ugh, i can not believe you are not going to be there!
oh, i know.
so-so come! why do not you come?
what?!
to london! come to london. please? it will mean so much to me.
yeah, well, i got to work, I am sorry.
why-why can not you take a couple of days off?
because, i can not! ross, i told you, no. i can not.
this is my wedding.
all right, y’know what? we really are late! let us go! let us go! let us go!!
fine. you will-you will watch it on video when we get back.
(entering, with phoebe’s book.) here you go phoebe! here you go phobo! phewbedo! phaybobo.
(laughs) thank you.
thank you. (she pats him on his head.)
all right, let us go! bye, pheebs!
bye, pheebs!
london baby!! (and rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)
oh, do you need a hug? you do not have to bring me anything!
come on! do something!
i am, I am ignoring you.
okay, here! (gives him the camera.) i want to be the on camera guy. all right, first stop, westminster abbey. (joey folds out his "pop-up" map of london. all of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)
oh, what the hell is that?
it is london, baby! all right, the hotel’s here. (points to the map.) wait. no, we want to go… no. i know. (sets the map down.) I am going to have to go into the map. (so joey literally steps into the map.)
okay, if you see a little version of me in there? kill it!
i got it! (picks up the map and starts walking.) here we go.
okay. listen-listen, we are not going to have to walk this way the entire time are we?
shhh! (pause) man, you made me lose it! (he goes into the map again.)
whoa-whoa-whoa! emily, (gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?
what?! no! no! that is-that is time-out!
sweetie, you got to relax. everything’s going to be great, okay? come on. come on.
chicken kiev?
um-hmm! does not that sound delicious at the last minute?
yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. and, you would not have to worry about the salmonella. (ross pushes her.) so, i can not wait to see this place you are getting married!
yeah. yeah. yes, this place is beautiful. emily’s parents got married here.
it is nice.
it is all right! everything’s going to be all right.
uh-huh, i see that.
(entering) okay, i talked to the guy with the shovel and i found out what happened.
what? what?
they torn it down a few days early.
all right! westminster abbey! hands down, best abbey I have ever seen. hey! (pushes chandler in front of the camera.) okay. what do you think of the abbey, chandler?
i think it is great. it is great. y’know, they are thinking of changing the name of this place.
really? to what?
to put the camera away!!!
man, you are westminster crabby. (he starts chasing chandler towards the abbey.)
oh. oh.
oh, honey! do not get up! what do you need?
oh, no. oh, nothing.
come on! i am here to take care of you! what do you need? anything.
okay, i have a wedgie.
okay, that is all you.
so-so, what do you want for lunch?
oh, i do not know. i guess we have to eat.
yeah, i do. what is the matter?
I am just bummed about the way i left things with ross. i should not have lied to him about having to work. he seemed so mad at me.
eh, do not be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was getting married…
(interrupting) still in love with?!
yeah!
I am not in love with ross!
oh. no. no. good! yeah, me neither.
phoebe, I am going to ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. not because, I am still in love with him! i mean, hey, y’know, i like ross as much as the next guy, y’know? clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings do not mean love! i mean, i still have loving feelings for ross. yeah! but, i have, i have continuing feelings of love, but that does not mean that-that I am still in love with him. y’know? i-i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love him—ohh! oh my god! oh my—why did not you tell me?!!
we thought you knew!
we?!
yeah, we all know! we talk about it all the time!
you all know? does ross know?
oh no, ross does not know anything.
oh, i can not believe you did not tell me!
well, because we thought you knew!! it is so obvious! god, that would be like telling monica, "hey, you like things clean."
hey!
check this out? huh? (joey has this big tall hat with a british flag on the front of it.) yeah. that is the stuff. what do you think?
well, i do not have to buy that, "I am with stupid" t-shirt anymore.
well, i like it. here you go. (he pays for the hat.)
all right, look, you are not really going to buy that are you? do not you think you have embarrassed me enough for one day?
oh, i embarrass you?
how can i answer that when I am pretending i do not know you?
oh really? then how come no one here is wearing them?
all right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you are going to spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
oh yeah? (puts the hat on.) if you are going to make me choose between you and the hat? i choose the hat.
thanks.
okay, wait. all right, that is it, okay, I am out of here. i am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (he trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
hey! i just spoke to your dad, and you know what? he seems to think we will be able to find a new place for the wedding.
whoa-whoa-what? you found a place?
she said what?
postpone it? emily, do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (he puts his pants on backwards.) this is not right.
i can not ask people to do that? would you ask people to do that? (holds out his pants)
the only thing i understand is; postponing it is not an option. this is when we are getting married.
no. I am saying it is now. (he starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)
there is no ‘or’ in mind. what is wrong with these pants?!!
(chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. his got them on right now.) no, wait! emily! no, wait, stop! emily, please—(he catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)
hey!
(depressed) hi.
so, did shopping make you feel any better about ross?
manhattan does not have enough stores.
well, i think i can help you get over him.
you can?
yeah. i just need you to bring me some photos of ross.
um-hmm.
and a small piece of chocolate.
okay.
and a glass of tepid water. (she gathers up all of these things.)
ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
uh, only if you have the hiccups too. yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. i just did not feel like getting up. okay, I am going to show you a picture of ross. okay? and you are going to remember all of the bad things about him. all right? really focus on his flaws.
i can do that. i certainly did it when we were going out.
okay. umm, before we get started, i just want to say for the record that i love ross, i think he is such a great guy. here. (hands her the picture, rachel grabs it out of her hand.) okay, now, close your eyes. and imagine that you are with ross okay and imagine that you are kissing him. and you are-you are running your hands all over his body. and then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it is some kind of grease, it is—uck! hah?
i do not know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
okay, this is going to be harder than i thought. umm, let us try some uh, aversion therapy.
okay.
okay?
all right.
so uh, now look at the picture…
okay.
all right, and umm… (she grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.)
ow!
okay, how do you feel now?
well, i like you less!
hey.
hey. (he nods at the hat.)
oh. (takes off the hat.) sorry!
no-no-no, y’know what? i really should not have said that you were embarrassing me, i mean that really was not cool. and if it makes you feel any better, I have had a really lousy day.
me too.
yeah?
noo!! I have had the best day ever! dude, check this out!
(entering) hey!
sh-shh-shh! (he motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
(on tape) okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
(on tape) oh, chandler.
that is… that is was…
oh my god!
that is fergie baby!!
how did you? how? how?
well, i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace, right? so, I am in my map and-and…(ross enters) hey!
hey!
hi. i understand you had a little talk with emily.
(laughs) yes, i did! and you are welcome!
am i?! and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
umm…
I am going to go to the bathroom.
wait up! (they both run to the bathroom.)
hey-hey, since you are the ‘fix-it’ lady, here is a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she does not want to have the wedding at all?
she said that?!
yeah.
why?!
i do not know, i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
oh my god. you are even dumber than i am!
excuse me?
ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
i do not know. a month?
emily has probably been planning it since she was five! ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. that is what we did! we dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (starting to cry), with the little people on top. (ross gets thrown a box of kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) thanks. but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
i had no idea. and that-that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
sometimes we were.
come on. you got to help me figure out what to do. okay?
okay.
come on. (they leave and chandler sticks his head out.)
that was pretty intense huh?
yeah. (pause) hey, i hope ross did not think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
(glares at him) i hope he did!
hello.
(on phone) hey, pheebs! it is joey!
hey, joey! hey! ooh! ooh! i just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. and i was going to go over and say ‘hi!’ but then i figured, he does not care if he looks like you.
that just cost me four bucks. but uh listen, i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
ohh, they are having a great time with their aunt phoebe! aunt rachel has not been helpful at all. so, do you miss me?
kind of, but I have just been having way too much fun.
so you are not homesick yet?
no, i do not think so.
all right, the seven of us miss you.
who is seven?
y’know, me, rachel, the birds, the babies…
ahh, the babies miss me?
ooh, the pizza guy’s here!
what? you ordered pizza without me?!
yeah. but y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the joey special.
two pizzas?!
yep! okay, got to go, talk to you later.
wait, well, where did you get it from?!
you will see.
okay? but-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? and-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…
and the musicians, look, they can go over here (points to a little alcove), okay? and the chairs can face this way (points), and… (points to ross) you go.
but-but, if you do not love this, we will do it in any other place at any other time. really, it is fine, whatever you want.
and, i do not know, if it starts to rain…
ohh. and i do not even have a date.
pheebs?
yeah?
do you remember where the duck food is?
yeah, it is in the guys’ apartment under the sink. why?
(enters with a bag packed) because I am going to london.
what?! what do you mean you are going to london?
yeah, i have to tell ross that i love him. now honey, you take care, you do not have those babies until i get back. (kisses her stomach.)
i—rachel, you can not go! ross loves emily!
yeah, i know, i know, i know he does. but i have to tell him how i feel! he deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
that is not why you are going! you are going because you hope he is going to say, "yeah, i love you too, rach. forget that british chippy."
ohh—do you think he will?!
no! because he is in love with the british chippy! look, rachel, if you go, you are just going to mess with his head and ruin his wedding! y’know, it is too late! you missed you are chance! I am sorry, i know this must be really hard, it is over.
y’know what? no. it is not over until someone says, "i do." (exits)
i do! i do! i do! (chases her into the hall, but rachel does not stop.) i do! (gives up.) ugh, like i can really chase you. I am carrying a litter.
oh...yes..is this..umm..emily’s parents’ house.
(in a british accent) this is phoebe buffay. i was wondering, please, if-if it is not too much trouble, please, umm, might i speak to miss emily waltham, please?
no no no, I will be nice, i swear!!!   could you just give me the number for where they are?
ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. and i have to warn somebody, alright. so if you do not give me that number then I am going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to new glocken..shire.
hello, hello. ohh, ohh, she knew i could kick her ass.
hey.
(ross hugs his mom and dad)hi. mom. dad.
ha ha, a joke that is funny in all countries.
what is in it?
(looking up at the waiter)that is not food...no, i do not, no...(taps chandler on the shoulder.) everything's different here...i want to go home. i...i miss my family. i miss the coffee house. i can not even remember what phoebe looks like.
joey, it is been three days, okay.. your just a little homesick, okay. would you just try to relax. just, just try to enjoy yourself.
(pointing  at chandler.) your different here too. your mean in england. (chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. they walk away from each other.)
what is up, dad?
(holding him back.)dad, dad, please. look i do not want anything to upset emily tonight. alright, she is had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (picks up the bill.) now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
(looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) and I am going to go get drunk. (gets up to get a drink.)
(running to the ticket counter) ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. (slightly out of breath) hi.
(faking cheerfulness.) hello. umm, when is your next flight to london?
ohh, good.
ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
(looking through her wallet.) ohh, i just do not think i have enough left on my credit card.
ohh, okay, how about five. (she hands her all the credit cards.) ohh, thank you.
(looking through her purse.) okay, you know what? i do not have it, but i can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. but you know what? i have my drivers license and i have a twenty. (she slides it across the counter.)
look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. now i might be able to get you the new lawn.
i go back there with lawn ornaments, he is going to laugh in my face.
(running to her room.) hi, pheebs.
(looking relieved. she puts down the phone.) oh thank god. oh, you changed your mind. oh, look i know you probably want to be alone, and you do not want to talk about it, that is fine. i just want you to know, i think you are doing the right thing and...
(running back out the door with her passport.) bye, pheebs.
(trying to get up.) wait!! where are you going?! what are you doing?! no!! wait!! (not able to get up.) god!! why am i always pregnant when she does that?!
I would like to toast, ross and emily. of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or melba toast, if you will. (no one in the room laughs. he starts to get flustered.) okay. i known ross for a long time. in fact, i knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. (ross looks embarrassed.) and i thought things were going to work out for him..until the day he over inflated her. (he laughs. jack looks at judy and no one in the room laughs.) ohh, dear god.. (a cellular phone rings.)
oh, hi, mrs. waltham. i need to speak with ether one of the best men, or ross’s sister monica.
oh, I am phoebe buffay. I am one of ross’s best friends.
yeah, um, i can not fly. I am having my brother’s babies.
no..umm, could i talk to one of them? it is very very important.
ohh! okay, I am going to have to kick her ass too.
(continuing his toast.) and I am sure we are all very excited that ross and emily are getting married at montgomery hall. i mean to think, my friend getting married in monty hall. (no reaction from the people.) ohh, come on!! monty hall!! let us make a deal!! come on, you people!! all right, forget it!! congratulations, ross and emily. (he sits down.)
hey, best man number two, joey tribbiani. now I am not good with the jokes like chandler here. boy...but ahh, i just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. i first met ross in this coffee house back home...home...new york city...where everybody knows my name. well anyway, i love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) but not as much as i love america. (looking at chandler.) could we please..go home now?
(putting his arm around her.) I am not going anywhere, sweetheart.
i was laughing. (patting him on the knee.)
out loud?
well i did not want everyone to think i was stupid.
so how are you doing?
my mother’s driving me crazy, but ross is getting married. I am happy. (a drunken man approaches.) I am not going to let anything spoil that.
well, thanks, we like him.
look, were down to just one point. could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
the guy was hammered, okay? there is no way, you look like ross’s mother.
then why would he say it?
because he is crazy. okay? he came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in titanic.
oh, my mother’s right. I am never going to get married.
ahh, you know what? that is....who would not want you?
ohh, please?! I am a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!
hi, I am back. listen, i need to...
hello. i need to get on the 11 of the clock flight.
okay, you know what/ you are going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.
sure, you know what? come on, we will just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".
look, if i do not get to london!! he is going to marry that other girl!!!
all right, you know what? i am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (she pounds her hand on the counter twice. the ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)
(screaming) I am getting married today!! whoo-hoo!!
(with the covers pulled up to his chin.) morning, ross.
I am getting married, to..day!!
yeah you are!!
ahh, whoo-hoo!!(he runs back out the door.
(comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) do you think he knew i was here? (chandler quickly looks at monica not knowing what to say.)
well I have-I have never done that with you before.
(in am uneasy voice.) nope. (she chuckles uneasily.)
so, ahh, how are ya? how ya...how ya... you okay?
yep, yep...you?
yes...yes..uh-huh, you?(looking over at her. she looks back.) we did you.
well...I would better get going.
oh yea yea, absolutely.
(scoots towards the side of the bed.) could you not look?
i do not want to look.
ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.)
yeah?
oh. I am sorry. I am very sorry. sorry. (she hums and sighs happily.) it is just, I am ahh, I am kind of excited. I am, ahh, going to london to ahh, tell this guy that i love him and... (he puts his headphones on to ignore her.)
hello?
(angrily.) hey, were the hell have you been?!
hey. i spent the night out. i met this cute bridesmaid. she is so...
i do not want to hear about her!!
ahh pheebs, you know you are still my number one girl.
no! no, we have an emergency. okay? rachel’s coming to london.
ohh great!!!
no it is not great. no, she is coming to tell ross that she loves him.
(confused.) but, he loves emily?
i know that!!! you have to stop her!! she is going to ruin the wedding!!
okay.
all right, so, okay...
hold on. hold on. (picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) rachel coming. do...something.
okay, so I am done my part, okay. it is your responsibility now, okay. the burden is off me, right?
right!
so tell me about this girl?
hey.
hey.
have you seen monica?
(very defensive.) I am not seeing monica.
(with a confused look on his face.) what?
what?
look we have got to find her. phoebe just called!! rachel’s coming to tell ross she loves him!!
oh my god!
i know! that is why we got to find monica!! you know where she is?
no!! okay!! what is with the third degree?! why do not you just shine a light in my eyes?! (joey looks totally confused.)
...and so then i realized. all this stuff i had been doing. proposing to joshua, lying to ross about why i could not come to the wedding. was all just a way of...
ehh, pardon me?
but he has to know how i feel!
(sighing) well i-i think your wrong.
well, i love it. i only hope my wedding looks this good.
(angrily.) you can let some of them go by!(judy and andrea go to the front of the chapel. joey approaches monica.)
(whispering.) pisst, monica. alright, we really need to start looking out for rachel. I will cover the front door. you watch that big hole at the back of the building and i got chandler covering ross.
(awkwardly.) why would i care where chandler is? you know uhh...you know sometimes i do not even like chandler.
okay. (they both walk off to watch for rachel.)
(using a slightly different inflection for each.) i do. i do. i do.
oh yea, your right. it is the second one.
(very nervous)really?
hey, felicity.
yeah.
(in a new york accent.) fuggetaboutit. (she giggles.) how you doin?
oh, yeah.
dad!! (emily comes running in.)
nothing, nothing. everything's under control.
(stepping in between them.)okay! okay! that is it!! parents!! parents!! back away!! all right, this is our wedding day!   from now on everyone gets along, and if i hear one more word. no grandchildren! (pointing at his mother.) that is right!!
(sighing.) it was...this disagreement over...(she sighs. ross notices her in her wedding dress.) my god. you...you look beautiful.
you know what, i think we have had all the bad luck we are going to have. (he hugs her.)
my god. rachel! (he walks towards her, grasps her hands and kisses her on the cheek.) your here. i can not believe it. (she giggles.) what happen? why are you here?
well i just came...(she touches him near his heart. she is almost in tears.) i just needed to tell you...(looking into his eyes. she takes a deep breath.) congratulations. (he hugs her. she can barely hold back the tears.)
mrs. waltham. hi. it is phoebe again.
yea. can i please, please, please talk to one of the best men? this is going to be the last time i promise.
(smiling.) ohh great!! (putting the phone to his ear.) hello. (he begins to escort her down the aisle.)
did you stop rachel?
no, but it is okay. she just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
so nothing got ruined?
no.
oh that is so great! ohh, so what is going on now?
ah, I am-I am walking down the aisle...still walking. (mrs. waltham takes her place.) I am about to pass the bridesmaid i hooked up with last night. (looking at the bridesmaid.) hey! (talking to phoebe.) i told her "hey." and now I am at the front with ross. it is phoebe. (he shows ross the phone.) he looks pretty mad. uh...I would better go.
no!! wait, wait, wait!! oh please, hold it up so i can listen. (joey looks at ross and holds the phone above ross’s shoulder.)
what we did last night was....
stupid.
totally crazy stupid. (he nods his head at the people seated.)
what were we thinking?
I am coming over tonight though, right?
oh yeah. definitely.
i ross...
take thee, rachel...(all his friends have looks of shock on their faces. he realizes what he said. quickly he says.) emily. (a slight chuckle.) emily.
how could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
i have no idea. but look how much they spent!
monica, would you calm down? the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
i know. it is just such reckless spending.
i think when someone steals your credit card, they have kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.
that is me.
oh! the yuk! ross, he is doing it again! (points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa)
marcel, stop humping the lamp! stop humping! now marcel, come back- (marcel runs toward rachel's room) come here, marcel-
oh no, not in my room! I will get him.
ross, you have got to do something about the humping.
what? it is, it is just a phase.
well, that is what we said about joey...
would you all relax? it is not that big a deal.
(out of shot) stop it! marcel! bad monkey!
what?
let us just say my curious george doll is no longer curious.
oh, monica. you are not still going over that thing.
this woman's living my life.
what?
she is living my life, and she is doing it better than me! look at this, look. she buys tickets for plays that i want to see. she, she buys clothes from stores that I am intimidated by the sales people. she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
you are not an artist.
yeah, well i might be if i had the supplies! i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i do not.
oh, monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
oh really? okay, let us compare, shall we.
(yawning) oh, it is so late for 'shall we'...
do i go horseback riding in the park? do i take classes at the new school?
(yawning) nooo...
this is so unfair! she is got everything i want, and she does not have my mother.
how about joey... pepponi?
no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that is more neutral.
joey... switzerland?
plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like I am, i dunno, this big. (waitress looks at him funny) which I am not.
joe...joe...joe...stalin?
stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.
well, it does not ring a bell with me...
(writes it down) joe stalin. y'know, that is pretty good.
might want to try joseph.
joseph stalin. i think you would remember that!
oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof.
hey.
hey.
hi. (on the phone) hi, uh, yes, this is monica geller. um, i believe I am taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were.
what are you doing?
(hushes her) alright, great. thanks a lot. (hangs up) I am going to tap class.
what, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
this woman's got my life, i should get to see who she is.
go to the post office! I am sure her picture's up! ...okay, monica, y'know what, honey, you are kind of losing it here! i mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
this is madness. it is madness, i tell you, for the love of god, monica, do not do it!! ...thank you.
what d'you think?
lotsa things.
which one do you think she is?
oh, no thanks, we are just here to observe.
what does she mean?
i think she means (imitates) 'you dance a dance class'. oh, c'mon, c'mon. (they put on some spare shoes)
okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
she could be you.
okay, I am not getting this!
(dancing in a swirly, phoebe kind of way) I am totally getting it!
did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
what? you just click when they click.
okay. and, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I am with rachel.
great. it is gym class all over again.
why do not i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
oh. monica! ...hi. I am mo- ...nana.
yeah. it is dutch.
um, pennsylvania dutch.
(mortified) hi.
where have you been?
at the vet.
she is not going to make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase. apparently he is reached sexual maturity.
(to chandler) hey! he beat ya.
she says as time goes on, he is going to start getting agressive and violent.
so what does this mean?
I am going to have to give him up.
i can not believe it, ross. this sucks!
i do not get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?
i know. i know. i mean, one day, he is this little thing, and before you know it, he is this little thing i can not get off my leg.
is not there any way you can keep him?
no, no. the vet says unless he is in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he is just going to get vicious. I have just got to get him into a zoo.
how do you get a monkey into a zoo?
i know that one! ...no, that is popes into a volkswagen.
well, we are applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he is out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that is a possibility.
yeah, but that is like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it is a total party zoo.
hey. we found her, we found the girl.
what?
did you call the cops?
nope. we took her to lunch.
ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
what?! are you insane? this woman stole from you. she stole. she is a stealer.

because... I am monica geller. it was my credit card you were using.
i want you to know, it was not me who turned you in.
no, thank you! you have given me so much! i mean, if it was not for you, i would never have gotten to sing memories on the stage at the wintergarden theater!
i just can not believe you are in here. i mean, what am i going to do without you? who is going to crash the embassy parties with me? who is going to take me to the big apple circus?
well, not... worried, just... wondering.
not necessarily...
um, I am not actually amish.

yeah, but at least I am doing it!
okay. good-bye, little monkey guy. alright, i wrote you this poem. okay, but do not eat it 'till you get on the plane.
aww. thank you, aunt phoebe.
oh!
okay, bye, champ. now, i know there is going to be a lot of babes in san diego, but remember, there is also a lot to learn.
i dunno what to say, ross. uh, it is a monkey.
just, just say what you feel.
marcel, I am hungry.
that was good.
(brings marcel a teddy bear) marcel, this is for you. it is, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
uh, if you guys do not mind, I would like to take a moment, just me and him.
marcel, c'mere, c'mere. (he sits down and marcel jumps down and sits beside him) well buddy, this is it. there is just a coupla things i want to say. I am really going to miss you, and I am never going to forget about you. you have been more than just a pet to me, you have been more like a be- (marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg) okay, marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! marcel, would- okay, just take him away. just take him.
hi, uh, I will be reading for the role of mercutio.
holden mcgroin.
guys? there is a somebody I would like you to meet.
w-wait. what is that?
'that' would be marcel. you want to say hi?
no, no, i do not.
oh, he is precious! where did you get him?
my friend bethel rescued him from some lab.
that is so cruel! why? why would a parent name their child bethel?
hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass!
ross, is he going to live with you, like, in your apartment?
yeah. i mean, it is been kind of quiet since carol left, so...
why do not you just get a roommate?
nah, i dunno... i think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kind of pathe- (realises) ....sorry, that is, that is 'pathet', which is sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
so you guys, I am doing all new material tonight. i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
might want to open with the snowman.
so, how did it go?
ahhhhhh, i did not get the job.
how could you not get it? you were santa last year.
i dunno. some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. he is not even jolly, it is all political.
so what are you going to be?
ah, I am going to be one of his helpers. it is just such a slap in the face, y'know?
hey, do you guys know what you are doing for new year's? (they all protest and hit her with cushions) gee, what?! what is wrong with new year's?
nothing for you, you have paolo. you do not have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! man, I am talking loud!
well, for your information, paolo is going to be in rome this new year, so I will be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
yeah, you wish!
it is just that I am sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. i say this year, no dates, we make a pact. just the six of us- dinner.
y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
phoebe, you are on.
oh, oh, good.
(into microphone) okay, hi. ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, miss phoebe buffay. wooh!
(takes mike) thanks, hi. um, i want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (shakes bell as an introduction) (sung:)
(sung)
(sung)
well, c'mon, if it is important enough to discuss while I am playing, then i assume it is important enough for everyone else to hear!
(quietly, to the others) that guy's going home with a note!
could you speak up please?
okay, we are going to take a short break. (goes over to their table)
hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
come here, marcel. sit here. (marcel wanders off)
pheebs, i can not believe he has not kissed you yet. i mean god, by my sixth date with paolo, i mean he had already named both my breasts! ...ooh. did i just share too much?
just a smidge.
david's like, y'know, scientist guy. he is very methodical.
i think it is romantic.
me too! oh! did you ever see an officer and a gentleman?
yeah!
well, he is kind of like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he is smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just- i just want to be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you are going to ask him to new year's, are not you. you are going to break the pact. she is going to break the pact.
no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just?
yeah, because i already asked janice.
what?!
c'mon, this was a pact! this was your pact!
i snapped, okay? i could not handle the pressure and i snapped.
yeah, but janice? that-that was like the worst breakup in history!
I am not saying it was a good idea, I am saying i snapped!
hi. hi, sorry I am late.
too many jokes... must mock joey!
nice shoes, huh? (he wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
aah, y'killing me!
ross! he is playing with my spatulas again!
okay, look, he is not going to hurt them, right?
do you always have to bring him here?
i did not want to leave him alone. alright? we- we had our first fight this morning. i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i did not mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
y'know, if you are going to work late, i could look in on him for you.
oh, that would be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you are there to see him, okay, and you are not like doing it as a favour to me.
okay, but if he asks, I am not going to lie.
okay, alright, i have a question, then.
um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
sure.
oh, david, i, i think you are a sweeping sorta fella. i mean, you are a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
oh, yeah, oh, I am sure of it. you should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
oh yeah, right now.
okay, now you are just kind of tidying.
i can hop. (she hops onto the table)
so tell me something. what does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
I am sorry, okay. it is just that chandler has somebody, and phoebe has somebody- i thought I would ask fun bobby.
fun bobby? your ex-boyfriend fun bobby?
yeah.
you know more than one fun bobby?
i happen to know a fun bob.
(brings joey a mug of coffee) okay, here we go...
ooh ooh ooh ooh, there is no room for milk!
(glances at joey and then sips his coffee) there. now there is.
okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
uh, four.
four.
five.
five. (buries his head in his hands)
sorry. paolo's catching an earlier flight.
yeah, and i met this really hot single mom at the store. what is an elf to do?
okay, so I am going to be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
oh, c'mon. we will have, we will have a big party, and no-one'll know who is with who.
hey, y'know, this is so not what i needed right now.
what is the matter?
oh, it is-it is marcel. he keeps shutting me out, y'know? he is walking around all the time dragging his hands...
that is so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night.
really.
yeah, we played, we watched tv.. that juggling thing is amazing.
what, uh... what juggling thing?
with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that.
no.
y'know, it was not that big a deal. he just balled up socks... and a melon...
oh, hi max! hey, do you know everybody?
no, no, he has not been around.
minsk?
i know where minsk is.
so when, when do you leave?
hello?
hi.
um, well, max told me about minsk, so (puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! this is so exciting!
oh, you are not going? (fake disappointed voice) oh, why?
so-so you are really not going?
oh do not do that.
oh no no.
oh, but i can not do that-
it is your thing, and-
okay, um, stay.
stay.
getting so good at that! (she hops on)
you remember janice.
vividly.
hi.
sandy! hi! c'mon in! (she enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...you brought your kids.
par-tay!
that thing is not coming in here.
'that thing'? this is how you greet guests at a party? let me ask you something, if i showed up here with my new girlfriend, she would not be welcome in your home?
I am guessing your new girlfriend would not urinate on my coffee table.
okay. he was more embarrassed about that than anyone. okay? and for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
alright. just keep him away from me.
thank you. (she walks off) c'mon, marcel, whaddya say you and i do a little mingling? (marcel runs off) alright, I will, uh... catch up with you later.
oh my gosh! rachel, honey.. are you okay? where-where is paolo?
rome. jerk missed his flight.
and then... your face is bloated?
no. okay. i was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. something about how it was her cab first. and then the next thing i know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! so I am blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I am going to get into a cab she tackles me. and i hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (to monica) are people eating my dip?
wow, that is, uh, dirty.
hey, kids...
(watching marcel play with phoebe. to chandler) look at him. I am not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
(imitating) but you found me!
kill me. kill me now.
hey everybody! it is fun bobby!
(approaching) hey fun bobby! whoah! who died?
alright, janice, that is it! janice... janice... hey, janice, when i invited you to this party i did not necessarily think that it meant that we-
I am sorry you misunderstood...
oh, will you give me the thing. (snatches the camera)
hi, max!
are you alright?
you are going to minsk.
oh, you are so going to minsk. you belong in minsk. you can not stay here just because of me.
oh yes, yes, yes you can. just say, um, 'phoebe, my work is my life and that is what i have to do right now'. and i say 'your work?! your work?! how can you say that?!'. and then you say, um, 'it is tearing me apart, but i have no choice. can not you understand that?'. and i say (hits him) 'no! no! i can not understand that!'.
ooh, sorry. um, and, and then you put your arms around me. and then you put your arms around me. (he does so) and, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you will never forget me.
and then you say that it is almost midnight and you have to go because you do not want to start the new year with me if you can not finish it. (they kiss) I am going to miss you. you scientist guy.
there y'go, kids.
(to a woman who he has clearly just met) and then the peacock bit me. (laughs) please kiss me at midnight. (she leaves)
you seen sandy?
ooh. uh, i do not know how to tell you this, but she is in monica's bedroom, getting it on with max, that scientist geek. ooh, look at that, i did know how to tell you.
vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
the bll is drrbing!
and the moment of joy is upon us.
looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
everybody looks so happy. i hate that.
not everybody's happy. hey bobby!
y'know, i uh.. just thought I would throw this out here. I am no math whiz, but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (makes kiss noise)
i dunno. i do not feel like kissing anyone tonight.
i can not kiss anyone.
so I am kissing everyone?
nonono, you can not kiss ross, that is your brother.
perfect. perfect. so now everybody's getting kissed but me.
alright, somebody kiss me. somebody kiss me, it is midnight! somebody kiss me!
alrightalrightalright. (kisses him. ross takes a photo) there.
(watching marcel and talking to rachel) i wanted this to work so much. i mean I am still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he is just phoning it in. just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much does not love you back.
...i think that bitch cracked my tooth.
(laughing and turning off the tv) so, what did you guys think?
(on phone) hello? (listens) hold on please. joey, it is your mom. (hands him the phone.)
it is your mommy. it is your mommy.
ohhhh…
that is nice.
(on phone) mom, so what did you think? (he walks away allowing the gang a chance to figure out what they are going to say.)
well that was umm…okay.
it was not the best.
that was one of the worse things ever. and not just on tv.
wh-what are we going to tell him?
well, the lighting was okay.
ohh no you do not! you got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
and i have costumes.
oh great! that means I am stuck with, "so, we were watching you in there (points to the tv) and you were sittin’ right here! whoa!"
what are you going to do pheebs?
i do not know. i do not know. i can not lie to him again. oh no i—no! I am just going to press my breasts up against him.
and say nothing?
uh-huh, yeah that is right.
(hangs up the phone) wow! well, my folks really liked it! so what-what did you guys think? (phoebe smiles, walks up to him, and presses her breasts against him.) it was not that good.
phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
what? you mean behind my back?
(entering, excitedly) oh! hi you guys, oh my god! you will never going to believe happened to me today! i am sitting in my office and…
(entering from bathrooms excitedly) you guys! you guys! you are not going to believe what my agent just told me!
joey! kind of in the middle of a story here!
ooh, sorry. sorry. you finish, go.
okay, so anyway I am sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.
I am going to be on two tv shows!
joey!
oh, you were not finished?
yeah! guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. (to monica and phoebe) it was ralph lauren! (monica and phoebe gasp) ralph lauren walked into my office!
uh rach, if you are going to start another story, at least let me finish mine.
it is the same story.
(groans in disgust) wow, it is really long.
(ignoring him) anyway, ralph just came in to tell me that he is so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
still get a discount on wedding dresses?
yeah!
I am so happy for you!
well, these really are the days of our lives.
what?!
well, since you ask. they want me back on days of our lives!
(gasps) oh god!
i got—i get a big pay raise!
oh hey!
I will be playing drake remoray’s twin brother, stryker!
oooh!
i get to hire my own assistant!
(jumps up) well—i got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
(reading the resume) and you were at this job for four years?
okay, well this is all very impressive hilda, um i just have one last question for you. uh, how did i do? was this okay?
I have never interviewed anyone before. I have actually never had anyone work for me before. although when i was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this is not the same thing.
no. yeah, and i know that. all right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
all right. (hilda exits) I am a total pro!
(seeing him) wow! h-umm! hi! yes, uh I am sorry the models are actually down the hall.
really?! (taking his resume) okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. umm, so what is—what is—what is your name?
uh-huh, go on.
that is your whole name, okay of course it is! okay, well let us-let us just have a look-see here. (looking at his resume)
oh come on, what are you talking about? you have got three years painting houses. two whole summers at t.g.i. friday’s, come on!
okay, hold on just a second. (she grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) I am sorry, it is for human resources, everybody has to do it. could you just stand up please?
no-no-no-no. (waves him away as monica and phoebe enter whispering to each other.) hey! (monica shushes him.)
(to monica) anyway, i should go. okay, bye.
(to chandler) hey sweetie.
hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?
i can not tell you. it is a secret.
secret? married people are not supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.
awww. (kisses him.) but still no.
no I am serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you.
really? okay, so why do not you tell me what happened to ross junior year at disneyland?
oh no-no, i can not do that.
if you tell me, I will tell you what phoebe said.
okay.
okay.
so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, we are on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.
oh my god. he threw up?
no, he visited a little town south of throw up. (monica laughs hysterically.) so what was phoebe’s secret?
oh, nancy thompson from phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.
that is it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?
that is right! you lose sucker!! (pause) please still marry me.
chandler, you have an assistant right?
(angrily) did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!
no, i-i just do not know how you decide who to hire. i mean I have got it narrowed down to two people. one of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there is this guy…
what about him?
i love him. he is so pretty i want to cry! i do not know what to do. tell me what to do.
come on you know what to do! you hire the first one! you do not hire an assistant because they are cute, you hire them because they are qualified.
uh-huh. no, i hear what you are saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can i just say one more thing? (takes out his picture.) look how pretty!
let us see. (looking at the picture) oh my god! oh… but no! no! you can not-you can not hire him, because that—it is not professional. umm, this is for me (the picture) yes? thanks. (puts it in her pocket.)
okay you are right. I will hire hilda tomorrow. dumb old perfect for the job hilda!
let me see this guy. (phoebe hands him the picture.) w-h-wow! do not show this to monica! and do not tell her about the w-h-wow!
hey terry!
it is been a while, huh? wow, it is funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
so! stryker remoray huh? when do you want me to start?
okay.
(looking between the pages and him) audition? i thought you were going to offer me the part.
well, i was dr. drake remoray, stryker’s twin brother. i mean, who looks more me than me right?
y’know terry, i-i do not really need to do this. i got my own cable tv series, (pause) with a robot.
well. i guess you think you are pretty special huh? sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? well y’know what? (throws the script away) this is one star who is hoop… this is a star that the hoop—this hoop—i was dr. drake remoray!
hi! tag. what are you doing here?

oh-ohh, thank you.
well…
but i hired you!
yeah! you-you got the job! you are my new assistant!
yeah!

hey.
hey! good, you are home!
oh it is always nicer to here than, "aw crap! you again!"
hey baby. (kisses him.)
hey.
i made you a surprise.
oh yeah?
yeah, tacos! ever since you told me that story I have had such a craving for them.
did you not understand the story?
(entering) hey!

no! no. they are umm… they are just uh…ground beef smileys. (holding up one of the shells.)
uhh, those are tacos.

eh, either way I will pass. (quietly to chandler) i still can not eat those. (monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) what is so funny?!
(trying not to laugh) I am not laughing.
(to chandler) you told her!
nancy thompson’s getting fired! (monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
(to monica) look, okay-okay i had food poisoning! it is not like i choose to do it! it is not like—it is not like i said, "umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
you are right. i mean I am sorry. yeah, i should not be laughing. i should be laying down papers for you! (runs off laughing which gets chandler laughing.)
(to chandler) how could you tell her?!
i had too okay?! we are getting married! married couples can not keep secrets from one another!
oh really? well i-i guess monica should know about atlantic city.
du-ude!
(running up to ross) what happened in atlantic city?!
well, chandler and i are in a bar…
did you not hear me say, "du-ude?!"
and this girl is making eyes at chandler, okay? so after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing. now, i know what you are thinking, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you are right, chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
(to chandler) you kissed a guy?!! oh my god.
in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
oh mon, i laughed so hard…
ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
whatever dude, you kissed a guy.

I am sorry joey.
why would they do that?! it was a good show right?!
you want to tell secrets?! okay! okay! in college, ross used to wear leg warmers!

ross came in forth and cried!
oh my god! (laughing)
oh, is that funny?! oh, you-you find that funny?! well maybe chandler should know some of your secrets too!
i-i already told him everything! (threateningly) you shush!!
once monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she would made.
ross used to stay up every saturday night to watch golden girls!
monica could not tell time ‘til she was 13!
it is hard for some people!
(to monica) of course it is. (mouths to ross) wow—whoa!
chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
hey!!!
ohh, I am sorry i could not think of anymore for ross!
ohh! ohh! in college, chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
that was you!
whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
how could this happen to me?! yesterday i had two tv shows! today, i got nothing!
well wait a minute, what happened to days of our lives?
uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.
what happened?
well maybe i got a little upset and maybe i told them where they could go.
joey, why would you do that?
because they wanted me to audition!
you! an actor?! that is madness!
tag? (he turns and looks at her.) hi, who was that?

so you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
all right i know, i know how it looks pheebs, but I am telling you…
but-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
yes, i know that. i know that. and i know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I have ever done. but I am telling you, from this moment on i swear this is strictly professional. (there is a knock on the door.) yes?
hi!
gay? yeah. (kathy leaves dejectedly.)
hey! terry.
wait! terry! wait—look—wait i-i… look, I am really sorry about before. i was an idiot thinking I am too big to audition for you. you got to give me another chance.
wait! terry! please! look, i just lost my other job. okay? you have no idea how much i need this. please, help me out, for old times sake.
(jumping up and removing the bandages) I am back baby! ha-ha-ha!
y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
and in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
(to monica) you have no trouble telling time now right?
no!
quick! what time is it?! (holds his watch in front of her face.)
i do not know! time to kiss a guy maybe?! (ross laughs.) what are you laughing at pampers? (he stops laughing and glares at her.)
y’know when i said that because we are getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
yeah?
yeah that was stupid. let us not do that.
ohh, absolutely.
and! we should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
yeah, definitely!
okay, (gets up) if you will excuse me, i-I am going to go hang out with some people who do not know the space mountain story.
then, I would steer clear of phoebe.
man! (monica mouths, "I am sorry.")
yeah, and not that you would, but i would not hang out with…all the guys in my office.
(noticing him) hi! (puts the pictures away.)
well yeah, sure, what is up?
oh really?!
oh, did you not want people to know that?
why is that?
ohh, you can say. come on, i do not want you to feel like you can not tell me things. (motions for him to sit down.)
‘kay.
yeah.
(pause) yeah, she is gay.
oh! yeah, this is fun, couples night.
yeah, i do not know why we hang out with married couples more often.
well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like you would not have done it. (she shrugs)
(entering) hey, you guys... i have great news.
ross, we are kind of in the middle of diner here.
oh, well, er, i already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when ross grabs a plate) guess what happened at work today...
a dinosaur died a million years ago?
try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... my tenure review board met today and i hear it is looking really good.
wow!
yeah. do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? i am going to get laid.
(while entering) hi you guys.
ooh, italian! (she also grabs a plate)
no one wanted seconds, right?
no, no. i-I am good.
hey you guys... you are never going to believe it. this headhunter called me. i have a meeting tomorrow with gucci. gucci wants me.
I am up for tenure.
congratulations!
you too! what are the odds?
ooh! (they hug)
(enters) guess what? (they all look expectantly at him) i finally got that seed out of my teeth.
i do not know who I am happiest for...
i do, he is been working on that all day! (looking at joey)
hey mon? was it weird changing your name to geller-bing?
no, no. it felt nice to acknowledge this. (pats chandler on his leg)
where did you go to do it?
uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
you never did it!
I am sorry. it is just the idea of being an official bing.
hey! i will have you know that... aah, who am i kidding. let us call the kid geller and let bing die with me.
thanks! honey, would you want me to take your name?
all right, let us see, call me mrs hannigan.
mrs hannigan?
what? can not you see I am in the middle of something? ooh, i like it.
(enters) hey guys.
hey joe! we have got a couple of things we have got to check out at the new house. you want to come with us?
no, thank you.
all right. i know you are not happy about us moving, but you are the only one who has not seen the house.
yeah, come with us. you will see how close it is to the city.
but no, it is not close. you said it was in escrow? i could not even find it on the map.
joey, please come. it would mean so much to us.
you know what? you are my friends, i want to be supportive, i will come with you. shotgun!
damn it.
see you guys later.
okay!
(to joey) I will pick you up at eleven. so glad you are coming.
good for you. that was really mature.
what? no, the only reason I am going to their stupid new house, is so i can point out everything that is wrong with it, so they do not move. I am going to make them stay here.
joey, you can not make someone do something they do not want to do. believe me, there is something I have been trying to get mike to do in bed and there is... he is just...
all right, prude... look, monica and chandler really love this house. you are not going to talk them into staying here.
hey, hey... i can convince people to do anything, you know. i bet i can even get mike to do that "thing". what is it?
i am not going to help you do that! goodbye! (he leaves)
(to maitre d') hi, I am here to see mr campbell... with gucci. the reservation is probably under gucci. it is spelled like gukki, which could be confusing.
oh my god! that is my boss. you have to seat us somewhere else.
but my... but my boss cannot see me. I am interviewing for another job.
sssshhhh!
hi... I am on a date...
yeah, it is. yeah, you know, it is tough. single mom, career... you got to get out there.
oh.
yes, hi!
hi! (to mr zellner) excuse us.
okay. oh, yeah... (whispering to mr zellner) oh he is cute!
wha... my resumé? i would not... i would not call my online dating profile a resumé.
(starts singing la la la la) whatever happened to just singing for no reason? huh?
what? i-i do not.
no, i-i-i love it there.
(to the woman behind her) this place is so depressing. if i had to work here I would kill myself. (she turns around and the clerk behind the counter heard her.) but you obviously have not.
i need to change my name, please. see, i need to change it because I am-I am hiding from the law. (the clerk shows no change in expression whatsoever) you are fun.
okay, well, i just do not, i do not know how it works exactly. see, my name is buffay and my husband's name is hannigan, so is it supposed to be buffay-hannigan or hannigan-buffay?
well, not anything, i mean...
oh, this could take a while.
okay.
hey!
hey pheebs.
oh, not anymore. i changed it today.
oh, I am sorry, mrs hannigan.
wrong again! apparently you can change it to anything you want. so i thought, all right, here is an opportunity to be creative. so meet princess consuela banana hammock.
that is what we were going to name the baby.
phoebe!
uh! princess consuela.
you seriously changed your name to that?
uh-huh!
okay, so from now on we have to call you princess consuela?
uhm, no. I am going to have my friends call me valerie.
hey, how did the interview go?
oh! it is not good.
you know, i always feel that way after an interview. I will bet it went better than you think.
well, i did not get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren.
that is a bad interview.
what are you, what are you talking about? how did this happen?
well, my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview and he heard everything. so later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he is going to have to let me go, because I am not a team player. and i said "wait a minute! yes i am." and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
oh god. I am so sorry.
hey! wha-hoo! what is this? (showing the bottle) well it is a, it is a bottle of champagne. why is this here?
ross...
i guess it is here because i got tenure!
this is the single greatest day of my professional career. gunther, six glasses!
oh, i thought joey was here. five is good. (gunther leaves, hurt) well, I am going to have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
ooh! israeli champagne. and it is vanilla!
i got tenure. i did not win the lottery... hey rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
oh it... good! yeah, but I am not going to hear from that for a couple of days.
oh, you know what? you are going to get it. i-i-i-i can feel it.
can you?
ah, all right. here is to ross!
and-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
and to knowing that your career does not mean everything. (rachel mouths "aah")
but also knowing it means a lot.
but more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
...that center around work.
to ross!
you know what the best part about this is? i can never be fired.
oh god!
no seriously. i have job security for life. you know, i never have to worry. (rachel starts crying) oh, look at you. look how happy you are for me.
(crying) no, it is not that. i got fired today. and i did not get the other job.
rach, I am so sorry.
oh!
great. i feel like an idiot.
no, it is okay, you did not know.
oh... (to the others) little heads-up would have been nice.
thank you for letting us see the house again.
and thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I have already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
ah, so glad you decided to come.
me too. yeah, this place is great. I am so happy for you guys. although, you know, i hope you like fungus.
what?
fungus! yeah. place is full of it.
no it is not. we had an inspection and they did not find anything.
okay. then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
maybe because it is you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
maybe. so this is the living room huh? ooh, it is pretty dark. (starts feeling around him like he is in a completely dark room, touching chandler, who backs out and hits him)
no it is not!
(squinting his eyes) are you kiddin'? i think i just saw a bat in the corner!
when your head was hanging out the window, it did not hit a mailbox, did it?
(glares at him for a moment, then admits grudgingly) maybe. well, i just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? or any other house for that matter.
oh joey, look, we know you are having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
fine, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? i just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. (he turns his back to them and starts humming) hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
joey, we know that is you.
no... hmmmmm... it is not... hmmmmmmmmmm
welcome back!
oh, me too!
well, I am no longer phoebe buffay.
yes i did! meet: princess consuela banana hammock! (she smiles from ear to ear)
nope.
yep.
why? it is fun, it is different, no-one else has a name like it.
great, okay, what are you going to change it to?
not amused) mike crap bag?
you are not serious, right?
uhu, uhu, well, then, great. if you love it, i love it.
and i love crap.
(turns the card around, obviously had the wrong answer) ow!
oh, hi, I am joey. my stupid friends are buying this house. who are you?
(understanding) oh.
i hate my friends. (they shake on it as if they just made a pact) alright, look. there is got to be a way that we can stop this from happening.
(thinking) uhm... oh! okay. you come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
woah, uh! okay, let us hear your great idea.
(frustrated) ahh! there is got to be a way. i mean, you know, if monica and chandler move out here and now phoebe is married to mike. that just leaves me and ross and rach, you know what i mean?
what am i going to do, i feel like I am losing my friends.
oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you are young. me, I am set in my ways.
yeah, yeah, i guess.
(having difficulty admitting it) yeah, maybe.
(in near tears, realizes she is right) i hate to admit it, but you are probably right. how did you get to be so smart?
(his mood changes instantly) just when i thought we could be friends. (he leaves the room)
oh, thank you... (looks at his face trying to remember his name)
(is embarrassed for a moment, but it quickly passes) well, now i do not have to. (the man leaves instantly)
(annoyed) ross, what is taking you so long?
(stares at her through the door and starts pushing the chair harder, looking very annoyed. he finally manages) (sarcastic) I am sorry, it is almost as if this was not built for a quick getaway!
(turns around) mark? oh my god! (puts the box on the chair and they hug each other)
I am fantastic. you remember ross?
uh, you know, you can not always get a seat on the subway, so... (laughs stupidly)
oh, well, (looks at her box and chair) you are not catching me on my best day.
no, but it is good, you know, I am going to take some time off and do some charity work.
well, screw charity work. what have you got?
great! I will call ya!
yeah! yeah, i got tenure! (mark looks at him strangely and walks off)
(very excited) oh my god!
see? i told you something good would come along. and he seemed really nice. I have met him before?
ross! that is mark. from bloomingdales? you were insanely jealous of him.
(realizing) that is mark?
yes.
i hate that guy.
oh.
no, no, no, you cannot go to dinner with him.
what? you do not want me to get a job?
oh yeah, I am sure he is going to give you a job. maybe make you his sexretary.
ugh.
I am serious. i just do not trust that guy, okay?
ross, you know what? (looks over to the door and sees security staring at them) okay, let us talk about it later, there comes security. (takes her box and leaves. ross follows her and then returns for the chair. he stands for a moment, then pushes it quickly in the general direction rachel went into, and out of the camera's view, and then nonchalantly walks away)
oh, i love this street. the trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
man, those two dogs are going at it!
(entering) hey!
hey.
hey, where have you been?
oh, just er... you know, looking around. but you know what? this house... is great.
really? what changed your mind?
oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
(frightened) what?
ha! I am just messing with you.
that is not funny! you know I am afraid of little girl ghosts!
joey, now that you are okay with the house, do you want to go see your room?
what? i get my own room?
you do not think we would buy a house and not have a joey room do you?
oh my god! (they all hug) oh! hey, can i have an aquarium? and a sex swing?
why not? I will keep the tank clean.
thank you, mister bag.
oh hi rita! good! (to mike) oh, rita's a massage client.
(shrugs) er, rita, this is my husband.
yeah.
(without moving her lips, wearing a fake smile) okay, i will. (to rita) this is my husband crap bag.
yeah... ogh... okay, fine. you made your point. can you please just be mike hannigan again?
how about uhm... how about buffay-hannigan?
yeah. I am phoebe buffay-hannigan banana hammock.
it is a funny word.
...oh crap!
hey, is rachel here?
no.
she is still at dinner?
i guess. why? who is she with?
that guy mark. from bloomingdale's... she thinks he is just being nice to her. but i know he really wants to sleep with her.
it is seven years ago. (he looks surprised) my time machine works!
we ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. but i know he just wants to get into her pants.
so what if he wants to sleep with her? i mean, she is single and he is cute.
excuse me?
oh please! yesterday on the subway? you could not stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
for your information, i was staring at her baby. we are about to be parents.
oh, sorry!
(entering) hi you guys!
hey, so uhm... how was dinner?
oh, it was great. mark is so sweet.
(speaking without pause, agitated) oh yeah? yeah? i wonder why? what could that smarmy letch possibly want?
oh ross, come on. he is happily married. his wife just had twins.
should we send something?
how did the job stuff go?
he offered me one.
that is great!
congratulations!
i know, it is amazing. it is amazing. it is so much better than what i had at ralph lauren. the money is great...
can we, can we just stop for a second? who said something better would come along, huh? you did not believe me. i told you everything was going to work out. (gasps) you know what? this calls for a bottle of israels finest.
the job is in paris. (they all stare at each other)
i mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am i missing opportunities? you know, I have always thought of myself as a serious actor. i mean, should i be trying to do more independent movies?
hey bear, i need some career advice.
I am tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
huh. (they all leave, dejected)
i have to say tupolo honey by van morrison.
nooo way! the most romantic song ever is the way we were.
see, i-i think that one that elton john wrote for, um, that guy on who is the boss.
what song was that, pheebs?
(singing) hold me close, young tony dan-za.
hi monica!
hey mon!
hey mon!
oh my god, has she slept at all?
nope.
no, it is been three nights in a row.
yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
oh, okay that explains it. i got a call at two in the morning, but all i could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so i thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. but then i realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
morning.
morning, hey, you made pancakes?
yeah, like there is any way i could ever do that.
(sarcastically) good morning.
hey, you know what, here is a thought. why do not you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
i can not believe that i am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I am such a grown up.
well, maybe i will not kiss you, and then you will have to stay.
(under his breath) kiss her! kiss her!
b-bye janice. so when ya' dumpin' her.
nope, not this time.
come on, quite yankin' me.
I am not yanking you.
this is janice.
yeah, i know. she makes me happy.
okay. all right. you look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you are not breaking up with her. no blinking.
(looks him in the eye) I am not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then joey blows in his face)
god, look what i found in the drain.
what?!
it is some of richard's hair! (holds it close to ross) what do i do with this?
getting it away from me would be job one.
it is weird, but you know what i do not want to throw this away. i mean this is like all i have left of him, gross, drain hair. ooh! (drops it in ross's cereal)
ooh. oh. it looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. (ross gives her this look, like 'yeah, does not it', and gets up to dump it down the drain.)
god, what is wrong with me.
you need to get some sleep.
i need to get some richard.
monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
i know, i know. I am just so tired of-of missing him. I am tired of wondering why has not he called. why has not he called!
maybe, because you told him not to.
what are you the memory woman?
(entering) their not breaking up. chandler and janice. their not breaking up. he did not blink or anything.
well, you know I am not surprised. i mean have you seen them together, they are really cute.
cute! this is janice! you remember janice?
yes, joey, i remember, she is annoying, but you know what she is-she is his girlfriend now. i mean what can we do?
there you go! that is the spirit I am looking for! what can we do? huh? all right who is first? huh? ross?
well I am thinking that chandler's our friend and janice makes him happy, so i say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
yeah, we will call that plan b. all right?
(she leans over and kisses him on the cheek) honey, i was wondering....
hmm?
do you still have that, um, navy uniform?
nooo, i had to return it to the costume place.
hmm.
i think i have an old band uniform from high school.
you remember not having sex in high school, right?
yeah.
well honey, what about you?
what?
i mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
no.
come on you got to have one!
nope.
ross, you know what...
what?
...if you tell me, i might do it.
okay, umm. did you ever see, um, return of the jedi?
yeah.
do you remember the scene with, um, jabba the hut? well jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, princess leia.
oooh!
princess leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. it was pretty cool.
yeah, oh, princess leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
really!
um, um. it is huge. yeah, that is the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
did you ever do the-the leia thing?
oh, yeah, um-mm. oh!
really! that-that great huh?
no it is just that i got this new pager and i have it on vibrate. see ya!
(entering with monica in tow) hey!
hi you guys!
look who i found standing outside of the szechwan dragon staring at a parking meter.
mon. hi!
hi.
why are not you at work?
oh, they-they sent me home.
why?
because i do not work at the szechwan dragon.
okay.
you really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
i know i do.
hi.
hi.
guess what?
what?
they published my paper.
oh, really, let me see, let me see.
rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the princess leia 'do.) oh, hi! where is my strong ross skywalker to come rescue me. (ross stands up horrified) there he is.
hey!
wheel!
of!
fortune! this guy is so stupid. (yelling) it is count rushmore!!
you know, you should really go on this show. all right, listen, i got three tickets to the rangers tonight. what did ya' say?
i say, 'i am there!' cool! aw, is ross going to?
no, janice.
jan-ice. because i, just, i feel bad for ross, you know, we-we always go together, we are like the three hocke-teers.
you know, i may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with janice?
no, yeeees. god, how do i say this. (walks into the kitchen, chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). oh, hi, you know that girl from the greek restaurant with the hair (holds his hands up to signify she has big hair)?
ooh, that girl that i hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
look, i do not hate janice, she is-she is just a lot to take, you know.
well, there you go.
oh, hey. come on man, do not look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
well, I am crazy about her now. i think this could be the real thing. capital 'r'! capital 't'! (joey stares at him) do not worry, those are the right letters.
look, what do you want me to say?
i want you to say that you like her!
i can not. it is like this chemical thing, you know. every time she starts laughing, i just want to (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that i can have something to throw at her.
thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) oh, and by the way there is no count rushmore!
yeah, then-then who is the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (chandler gives him a look like 'you stupid idiot!')
how could you have told her?
ross, i did not think it would that big of a deal.
oh, she did not think it would be that big of deal.
okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
okay, ross, phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. you know, i mean, come on, guys do the same thing, i mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
that is different, okay. that is like, uh 'who dated a stripper?' or 'who did it on the back of the staton island ferry?'.
were both of those joey?
yeah. look, you do not, you do not talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
not even with your best friend.
noo!
that is so sad. your missing out on so much, ross. i mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. and-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
hmph. so what you, you tell each other everything?
pretty much.
did you talk about the night of five times? do you tell people about the night of five times?
uh, honey, yeah that was with carol.
i know, but it is still worth mentioning, i think.
( in a soothing voice) relax every muscle in your body. listen to the plinky-plunky music. okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. okay, tell me your happy place.
richard's living room, drinking wine.
all right. no, no, no, not a richard thing, just put down the glass. and get out!
I am sorry, but that is my happy place.
well, okay, fine, use my happy place. okay, I am just going to, i have to ask that you do not move anything.
all right, I will try not to.
okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
all right, there are no questions in the happy place. okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
I will bet he is totally over me, I will bet he is fine.
all right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I am sure, not permitted in the happy place. okay. just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. and the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
okay, this is not working. I am still awake and now i have to pee.
i, ah, i never said hate, i was very careful about that.
and you got a 'hate' from that?! your taking a big leap there...
but what does that going to do...
okay. I am in.
does it have to be a whole day?
yeah, i know, i sleep in the next room.
(crying) so, i went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that i ordered for richard about the civil war. he loved the civil war.
monica, do you want us to take you home?
uh, huh. (to ross) or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (rachel, monica, and phoebe leave)
women tell each other everything. did you know that?
umm, yeah.
no chandler, everything! like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
girth? why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. do you want to?
we are not going to talk about girth are we?
nooo!
yeah, okay.
yeah?
yeah! all right! you go first.
okay, okay, I will go first.
okay.
so, uh, the other night rachel and i are in bed talking about fantasies, and i happened to describe a particular star wars thing....
princess leia in the gold bikini.
yes!
i know!
yes! wow, well, that-that was easy. okay, you-you go.
okay.
okay.
okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
hmph.
and, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. and you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like elle macpherson, or that girl at the xerox place....
with the belly-button ring? oh, muhawa!
i know, and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head. and your like 'mom, get outta here!' you know, but of course, like, after that you can not possibly think of anything else, and you can not, you know, stop what your doing. so it is kind of like, you are, you know. you know...(ross just stares at him). you do not know!
your mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your mom, what is the matter with you?
you said...
i said 'share' not 'scare'. go sit over there! (chandler goes over and sits at a table and puts his head down).
hey!
what are you guys doing together?
really.
yeah, yeah. we went to a mets game, we got chinese food, and you know, i love this woman. you have got competition buddy.
you still can not stand her can you?
I am sorry man, i tired, i really did.
well, you know, i appreciate you giving it a shot.
but, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and i survived, and what is even more amazing, so did she. it was bat day at shea stadium.
well, i guess that is something.
no man, that is huge! now, i know i can stand to be around her, which means i get to hang out with you, which is kind of the whole point, anyway.
okay.
oh, hey, chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into ross.
oh god!
hey, if it makes you feel any better, i do it too.
really?
oh yeah, i always picture your mom when I am having sex.
hi, dad, what are you doing here?
i do not, i just, i just like the smell of them. so, uh, what are you really doing here dad?
what makes you think that i might not be okay?
oh.
I am fine, just a little tired, I am okay. how is richard doing?
no, i really, really do.
really!
you are not just saying that are you?
was he crying?
well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
i think so.
okay, here we go. I am jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. what? honey, what is it? did i get it wrong? did i get the hair wrong? what? did you just picture it differently? what? what?
no, no it is, um, it is not you, um, it is um, it is (turns and sees his mom standing where rachel is)
i hate chandler, the bastard ruined my life. (rachel starts looking around and down, with a 'what the hell is going on?' look on her face.)
hey.
hi, my name’s chandler. i just moved in next door and i was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
sure, neighbor come on in.
so, is janine around?
uh, no, she is at dance class.
can i check out what she did to my room?
yeah, but, hey look, do not go through her stuff. she gets really mad.(chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)
(the room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) oh my god. what is th… it is like a guy never lived in here. look, you have got to be careful. this girl thing is dangerous. (looking around the living room.) it is spreading already.
(looking around the room.) it is???
(picking up a pillow.) yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
no.
(pointing to the table and picking up the box.) is that your tiny little box, that is too small to put anything in?
no.
no! ok, this is not good. you are a guy. ok? this is a guys place. if you let this go, you are going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
(with big eyes.) all right, you are right. I will talk to her.
yes talk to her. be a man.
I am a man.
defend yourself.
(grunting) hmm. (monica opens the front door and comes in.)
chandler come on. we have to hem the new dust ruffle.
be right there sweetums. (monica leaves. to joey.) a totally different situation.
hey guys.
hey, how was your breakfast with hillary?
it was okay. she is still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
ohh, yeah.
well, is this hillary your hot assistant chef hillary?
yeah.
the one that always stares at me when i come in?
no, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
still i could tell. she was into me. (joey rolls his eyes.) well, why do not you set us up?
ohh, are you setting ross up with someone? does she have a wedding dress?
(walking over and sitting down.) hey.
hey.
rachel?
yeah.
I am, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. so, can i come to bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
well, sure, but they might think it is kind of weird considering i do not work there anymore.
oh my god. what happened?
i-i, got a job at ralph lauren.
well that is great! congratulations!! (she hugs rachel.)
yeah. (chuckling) a year ago..
(hugging her again.) you have lasted a whole year. good for you.
but, pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where i actually work. but, just come by at lunch so my boss does not see you. because kim will just freak out and she already does not like me very much.
that is weird. i do not think my boss likes me either.
i do not think mine likes me either.
maybe it is a universal thing?
or maybe, it is because you are hanging around here at 11:30 on a wednesday. (everybody gets up.)
yeah let us head off to work.
we should go.
thank you.
sure.
now you will not believe this. but, i was in the copy room, making copies, and ralph lauren came in.
oh my god. did you talk to him?
yeah a little. he seems really nice. good kisser.
what? what!?! you kissed him?
totally.
(gasps) phoebe are you serious?
yeah. i was just in there. he introduced himself and the next thing i know, we are making out. you know.
phoebe, i mean, you do know he is married?
no!
phoebe…
what am i supposed to do? ask every guy i make out with if he is married? (rachel looks at her.) no, yeah, i should.
hey. uh, can i talk to you for a second? this, uh, kid in this picture. do you, uh, know this kid? is that like a relative or something?
yeah, that is what i was afraid of.. okay, uhh…look janine i really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. it is…too girly.
like this. (pointing to the picture) pictures of cute babies we do not know. we..we can not have that.
look i do not know this baby. i do not know if she is a famous artist or not. you know, and i do not want to be a jerk but you are changing too much around here.
yeah but it is too much stuff. you know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
I am sure it is a famous watering can, okay. but, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
ohh, well, that is ok then. but, okay my towels for instance. i come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. it is up here on some hook..and…smells different.
yeah, well, it feels different.
alright, i can make my peace with the clean dry towels…also what is with these chips you bought?
(voice cracking) well that is like summer in a bowl.
oh, kim, hi. (kim does not even look up from her report.)
so you know, i…i handed in that marketing report and i never got to hear what you thought.
ahh….so…wow…the spring line, it is really going to be great this year, huh?
so i hear the ralph lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. (kim stops the elevator and turns to rachel.)
hey guys.
what is up? (he smiles. his teeth are freakishly white.)
you know…oh my god.
what happened to your teeth.
i whitened them.
(sarcastically) really.
yeah. what do you think.
well, i think i should not look directly at them.
come on, seriously.
ross they are really, really, really white.
yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.
ahh, i-i did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
how much longer?
a-a day.
ross you know that tonight is your date with hillary?
i know. that is why i did it. (with a big smile) come on, are they really that bad?
no, no no no. you will be fine. (turning to monica) hillary’s bind, right?
she will be after tonight.
yeah. (rachel walks in.)
oh, hey, hey rach, do you notice anything..ahh…
yeah. your teeth? yes, i saw them from outside. (sitting down on the couch.) you guys are never going to believe this. but, phoebe made out with ralph lauren.
what???
oh my god.
yeah i know. she ran into him at my office and they just…made out. and the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because i told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she would heard all year.
i am proud of all my friends today.
my god, rachel, i can not believe phoebe made out with ralph lauren. ohh, I am so jealous. (chandler looks at her.)
hi, I am chandler. your live-in boy
chandler, please, come on. look at him. (pointing to a picture of ralph on a magazine,.)
oh, i am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (phoebe walks in.)
hey. here. (hands chandler a copy of her flyer and sees the picture of ralph.) ohh, who is the silver fox?
that-that is your make out buddy. do not you recognize him? (holding up the magazine in front of her face.) oh wait. ohh, phoebe i love you. kiss me please.
that is not ralph lauren. sounds like him though.
what?
yeah, no, ralph does not look anything like that guy. he is-he is young and he is got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
oh my god, phoebe, that is not ralph lauren. that is kenny the copy guy.
what?
oh..go..oh..and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren. if she finds out that i lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. phoebe!!
why would the copy guy say he was ralph lauren?
to get you to make out with him!!!
ohhh.
(holding a shirt in front of ross.) okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (ross has a big smile.) nope. okay, colors that do not work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
i do not know what I am going to do. that date starts in like an hour.
hey ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. your teeth would not look so bright.
oh great. so all i need to do is get some new skin. thank you.
I am just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
whoa. whoa. whoa. we are not 13 anymore.
ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
but, will not she notice i have makeup on?
please. half the guys out there have makeup on.
what??
all right, half the people. i mean, just try it and see.
no. i am not putting on makeup. (knock at the door. phoebe enters.)
hello. oh good. ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (he smiles at her.) oh!! demon!! demon!!
now are drawers will smell nice and we did not waste these pantyhose.
yes, god forbid we throw out old underwear. you-you know what? I am going to go over to joey’s.
wait, we are supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
yes, but i feel like I have really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. you know. in fact i think we are two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
you know what? this has been kind of a girlie day. you are right, I am sorry.
nah, nah, it is okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing.
yeah. go over to joey’s. go over to joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
you know when guys hang out they do not just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
when girls hang out, we do not have pillow fights in our underwear. (chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) I am sorry. we do. we do. i do not know why i said that.
hey chandler. come on in. we are knitting pot holders.
no thanks, josephine.
hey ross, i was wondering if… oh my god!! where are all the men???
ohh, hi, kim.
yeah, remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday? well it did not happen.
okay, two things did not happen. remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room? well, it turns out that is not true.
no.
oh no, no, no. oh god, you think i made out with him.
i-i do not want your job. i-i do not. ohh this is such a mistake. i did not make out with him. nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday. i do not even know how to use my keycard. (the elevator stops. ralph steps on.)
mmm-hmm.
mmm.
mm-hmm.
(chuckling) hmm-hmm.
mmm-unmm.
hmm-hmm-hmm. (putting his hand up to block his mouth.) okay. i, uh, am from long island. i-i came to the city for college. um, i, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time i like to read spy novels. but, but, let us talk more about you. hmm.
so what is really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
oh my god, joey, that is such a great tip.
monica, could you excuse us for a second? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
okay. oh but joey, come over later because I am going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
ohh, i love birds. (monica leaves. chandler shuts the door.)
what is the matter with you ?!?
what?
you are arranging flowers! (pointing to the dish on the table.) you got dead flowers! you got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! this is not joey!!
hey. hey look i am still joey, okay. flowers they are just, you know, they are nice to look at. and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. of a famous baby.
you are turning into a women.
no I am not. why would you say that? that is just mean.
now I have upset you? what did i say?
it is not what you said. it is the way you said it….oh my god, I am a women!!!
now, she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job.
but why did not you just tell her the truth.
i did but she does not think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren.
well, hey, what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? you know. what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man? huh, did she ever think of that?
you were with kenny today, were not you?
just for a second.
ohh, phoebe, what am i going to do?
well, the only thing you can do. sleep with ralph lauren.
I am not going to sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i would not.
ohh, sleep with kenny.
that would not help me.
ohh, yes it would.
mmm.
(giggling) hmm-hmm-hmm. (picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.) me, neither. I have had a really good time too, you know. (putting the bread down.)
(putting the bread up to his nose.) ohh, i just like the smell. (sniffing it.) mmmm.
hmm-hmm.
mmm-hmm. (picking up their wine glasses.)
(covering his mouth with the glass.) how about all the way.
(looking at the posters.) wow, cool poster. or should i say groovy poster? (they sit down on the couch. ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) so, ahh, where were we?
ohh, you can see them, huh?
i-i, did that for you.
what is a matter with me? you have got a black light. it is 1999!
kim, hi.
okay..okay.. look. I am sorry that i lied to you before. you were right. ralph and i were an item but were not anymore.
(faking crying.) yeah, he dumped me. he said, "rachel, i can not do this. even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. i can not do this. I am married and I am sorry." and then i do not know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. especially not above kim, who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine."
of course it is true and it hurts so bad.
you and ralph?
hey, uhh, i need to talk to you.
I am sorry but we have got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. i, uh, i got to be a man! okay. the living room has to remain a guy place, okay? that is just the way it has to be.
great…great…and thanks for being so understanding. i mean, i did not want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (she starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.) you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. i mean, if you want to.
and, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
and a couple of these little tiny boxes.
(smiling) okay.
(speaking to herself and reading cosmopolitan) oh, lucky me! coffee and a live sex show!
oh... oh, I am sorry! I am not... i was just-i was just reading to emma.
yeah, yeah... it is... "climax your way to better skin".
so you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
(hiding herself behind the magazine and whispering) not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
oh hey rach!
yeah...
maybe you could take charlie shopping.
oh, well...
are you kidding? rachel loves to shop! and she has great taste! yeah, she is the one who taught me, you do not wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you are trying on clothes.
ok, uh-uh... let us-let us shop!!
(to charlie) ok, you are going to come back with some very classy clothes... (aside to rachel)... and some slutty lingerie, slutty!
(entering and talking on mobile phone) ok, great! all right, bye! (she hangs up) pain in the ass!! (she looks at the others, then back at the phone) that is off, right?
what is the matter, pheebs?
oh... mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he is going to be there. and she was like "oh, do not worry! i asked him. he is totally ok with seeing you!". so now i have to go so he will think that I am totally ok with seeing him!
which you are not, because you have totally hung up on him!
exactly!
and you are going to want him to eat his heart out so you are going to have to look fabulous!
(after a short pause) i did not even think about that! (pause) aaargh, sexual politics!!
hey pheebs, I am-I am taking charlie shopping, why do not you come and I will help you find something.
ok, that will be great!
oh, are not that nice? the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
that is not what we are going to do!
why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
(looking at the picture of the female reproductive system) wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!
oh, i so can not believe this! my uterus is an inhospitable environment? i was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
oh, i can not believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
hi.
hi.
ok.
oh, damn it!
do not worry, after a while he will tune it out.
(long pause) ok.
is that a hint? because we love you doctor connelly but we do not think we would want you to be our child! (dr. connelly glares at him) wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!
hi! ok, you are ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?
(to charlie) alright, have a good time. (they kiss)
not going to find any clothes in there!
(entering) hey, you guys!
hi.
guess who is up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?
yeah, right! what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract (he and charlie laugh, then joey starts laughing too without any reason) well, why are you laughing?
just... seeing what it would be like to be a paleontologist... it is fun, yeah!
professor sherman, yeah. I have a meeting with him today.
yeah, well... i think i know how to dazzle him.
oh... you are not going to do a magic trick, are ya?
tsz... no! (he goes to sit down, dropping a multicoloured silk streamer off his sleeve).
(entering) hey guys!
wait a minute, you guys. oh, i want to ask you something. i-i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do, I would love for you guys to come and hear me.
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
it is in barbados.
but you come first!
I am there!
bye.
bye, see ya. (she goes)
(sitting down on the couch) ok.
all right, so. how did it go at the fertility clinic?
not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you are giving a sperm sample.
so-so what did the doctor say?
well... there is surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
so you are ruling out surrogacy?
yeah.
so, i do not have to learn what that means?
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we are talking about sperm donors.
enough said, I am there for you man. where is she, upstairs?
(stopping joey) ah-ha!
how do you feel about all this?
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i do not think there is one.
come on ross, be a good guy. step up and do it!
(puzzled) what?
(looking astonished) what? no! i am not going to give them ben!
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
(reading from a notepad) i mean, we have been accepting leakey's dates as a given, but if they are off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. (he throws the notepad in the waste bin) so-so what i am saying is - is is that (he picks the notepad back from the waste bin) is that the repercussions could be huge! i mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, i mean, truly the mind boggles!
oh, that is not what you want...
oh, I will take some of that.
pheebs, that is for men!
no, i know, this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him because I am going to smell like another guy. (to the shop assistant) yeah.
ok. oh good, I am dating a russian cab driver. (to the shop assistant). seriously does anyone buy this? i smell like beets!
on melanie griffith in "working girl". i think what you want is over here.
really?
oh, i can not. because i-I have seen them.
yeah! I am a big fan! of the movies, you know. motion pictures. the talkies!
(picks up a dress) hey rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
sure!
ok!
you know that depends on what it is! I have done a lot of stuff.
so what were you doing out there, do you not like charlie?
she is ok, i just do not get a really good vibe from her!
why?
i do not know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! you know, and just swept joey off his feet... i mean, nobody else has a chance!
who else?
anybody! you, me, you know, monica's mom...
you like joey?
shhhhh! phoebe! all right, look. i have a little thing for him.
(whispering) oh my god!
it is just physical and i have it totally under control! ok? it is just, when i see them together, sometimes i just get a little jealous!
uh, wow! is not it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
(annoyed) oh, i get it!
oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can not do anything about it, he is already dating her, and she is a nice person, that would not be right.
i know, i know, so it is just not a big deal.
yeah.
so can we keep this between us?
sure!
ok, great, because i got to get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
oh.
any chance charlie has a deaf twin?
hi honey!
hey! look i brought a friend for dinner, this is zack, from work!
oh, of course, it is so nice to see you again, zack!
you guys have not actually met before, but, boy! you are both polite! (pause) go to have a seat zack, and I will get you a beer.
i got it.
(to mon) so, zack's pretty nice, uh?
yeah, i guess.
so, how would you like to have a baby that is half yours and half his!
(turns around and she is quite shocked) excuse me?
well, we are talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he is intelligent, he is healthy, he is athletic, i mean, he is "spermtastic"!
chandler, this is crazy! what did you even say to him! "come up, meet my wife! give us your sperm"!
no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
chandler!
I am telling you, he is great! i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I would think he would be the way to go!
I am not going to be a part of this! you can not just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
ok!
uh!
(bringing the beer to zack) zack!
tell me about yourself, zack!
oh, god, do you think she heard? it would be so bad if she heard!
well, maybe she did not hear! ok I am going to go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I will talk and see if you can hear me.
ok, great!
oh, thank god i can not hear a word that you are saying!
(sticks her head out) i did not say anything yet!
(sticks her head out too) well, get back in there and talk!
(goes back in) I am rachel. it is so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
(comes out again) what!?
(comes out too) well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
ok well, i heard that! which means that she heard it too!
ooh! we have a problem.
oh! what are we going to do?
oh my god!
(yelling at the stranger) alright! enough out of you!
hello?
joey! hey, i need to talk to charlie. is she there?
no. no... eh... she went shopping with rachel. why? what is up?
I am meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
oh! how is it going?
it could be better! he, uhm... he fell asleep!
what!? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda!
barbados.
fine, I will rent a car and drive...! ross, you have to get that job!
what am i supposed to do? he is out cold! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder.
well, just wake him up!
i can not! if he realizes that I am the one that put him to sleep, i will not get the job!
uh! that is a tough one. oh! wait a minute, this happened to me before! yeah, i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... (pause) no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... yeah i mean hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
hey guys! dinner's ready!
so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!
ok, there is enthusiastic and there is just plain gay!!
you do not like him.
i think he is fine! it is just that we do not know anything real about him... we should get more information.
alright! just follow my lead!
oh! thanks, I am crazy about our place. hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
(very seriously) that is really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.
oh, friends first, drunk in london, you know the story. I have got a better question for you: do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
eh... heart disease, alzheimers, gout?
we are just making conversation. (chandler makes an agreeing-sound)
you know what is not funny? male pattern baldness (monica stretches her neck to look behind zack's head and then gives chandler an "ok" sign)
i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?
yess!! (m & c high-five and zack looks confused again)
(proceeding with his dinner) we are teeth people zack!
alright! let us just do it. let us just go over there and see if she heard.
good plan.
ok. (phoebe starts to walk in the opposite direction though. rachel sees and follows her) wha...? where? where are you going?
oh! I am sorry rachel, i do not have time for your childish games, ok? i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at "who is more over who"! (at which she walks away)
(to charlie) hey, hi! hey, where have you been?
(pretends to be stunned) oh! wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? well, that is so weird! phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. god it is just such a small world!
oh god. you did. you heard. ok, listen, let me explain.
(after a pause) yeah.
yeah! that is phoebe. that is phoebe. you know, she just wants them all! it is like she is a nympho!
yeah...
(looks ashamed) i try...
(to the still half asleep professor) oh my god! you really want me to be the keynote speaker? thank you! (hugs him whilst still on his lap)
(impressed) wow! you look... (drops the cookie)... stop-eating hot! which is like the highest level of hotness!
are you sure? because I am really dreading going to this party.
then do not go!
mike knows I am coming, and if i do not show up he will think it is because of him! and i do not want to lose face! that is a very serious thing in my culture.
alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike. and afterward you come to my place and I will get you good and drunk!
you got it! ok. but not on the wine that you made, ok, because i just do not want to go back to the emergency room.
david?
oh my god! (they hug)
yeah. what-what are you doing here?
what happened?
yeah?
well, it is great that you are back! how are you?
good!
(disappointed) oh, good for you.
mike and i broke up.
really?
i understand. yeah. ok so then ok, so we are both living in new york, not seeing anyone. that is so not like us!
well... (pause) no.
I would love to.
ok. (they walk away together)
oh, got it, stay upwind of me.
no, that is david.
(disapprovingly) tip of the iceberg.
you sure you do not want to stick around a little longer?
are you just tired now or are you always tired, because that could be a sign of clinical depression.
ok.
i think we have found our sperm!
does seem pretty perfect.
yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?
(pause) no.
why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are going to get that from you anyway!
no, that is not it. it is just that when we were asking him all those questions before, i just... i just realized i do not care if he is the most perfect guy in the world... he is not you.
yeah, he is better!
no, he is not. and if i can not get pregnant with you, then i do not want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
really? are you sure?
yeah, I am sure.
(sighs with relief) thank god, because i do not want to do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, I am the husband, I am supposed to... bring the sperm.
that is so sweet. i love you. (they kiss)
so you know this leaves us with...
adoption.
how do you feel about that?
i think i feel ok about it. actually i think i feel really good about it.
me too. i want to find a baby that needs a home and i want to raise it with you. and i want to mess it up in our own specific way.
so this is it, we are really going to adopt?
(smiling) yeah.
(excitedly) oh my god, we are going to be parents!
we are going to be great parents.
and it could be soon. i mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there (they go look through the window) our baby could be being conceived.
wait, if we are lucky, and we are really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
hey, zack!
look, i just wanted to apologize for last night. i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
really?
my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we are working on it.
you would not know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?
wow! that ripped! that ripped real nice!
how many times do i have to tell you! ya, turn and sliiiide! y'know, turn and slide.
you do not turn and slide, you throw it out! I am tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time i get dressed!
look, we are not throwing it out! i built this thing with my own hands!
all right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.
all right. but, you are going to have to tell them. (he opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)
(nods his head) do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to joey) they seem all right with it!
yesss!!
who is chip?
shhh!
chip, is chip matthews.
the guy who took rachel to the prom? why is he calling you?
‘because i ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
monica, you are so lucky! he is like the most popular guy in school!!
i know!! (calls him) (on phone) chip? hi! it is monica. (listens) ‘kay. (listens) ‘kay. (listens) okay. (listens) okay, good-bye. (hangs up) oh my god, we just had the best conversation!! (goes into her room as rachel enters)
(to rachel) i was just leaving.
good! ‘because I have got a product report to read, it is like eight pages, i hope i do not fall asleep.
why? did you write it?
(sees chip’s phone number) wow! look at that, chip matthews called. i wonder what he wants?
well ah, actually...
(interrupting) i bet he sensed that i was ready to have sex with another guy.
well, umm, why do not you give him a call?
okay. (picks up phone) are you sure you want to hear this?
oh, I am sure.
(on phone) chip! hi, it is rachel. (listens) rachel green. yeah, umm, you left me a message. (listens) yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. (listens) monica geller. (listens) ohh.
(whispering in her ear) oh, that is right! he called to ask out monica! that-that is got to be embarrassing!
(screaming, angrily) ...dumb, drunken, bitch!!! (applause) (happily) thank you, thanks.
(reading the newspaper) hey, here is a question; where did you guys get the finest oak east of the mississippi?
uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
I am reading your ad.
looks good, uh?
yeah.
(reading the ad) stunning entertainment center. fine, (pause) fine italian craftsmanship. (joey is very proud of himself)
oh my god, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
why? i love that thing.
you want it?
ahh, gepeto, $5,000 dollars? are you insane?
hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
all right look, I am changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
what kind of profit is that?! and you call yourself an accountant.
(looks at him) nooo.
oh. what do you do?
i can not believe you do not know what i do for a living!
yeah, i actually do not know...
good, so do i
something to do with numbers?
oh my god! no! shoo! kitty! no! no-no-no! shoo! come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) come on. crazy. (looks into the cat’s eyes) oh my god.
what?
nothing. nothing.
what? what is wrong?
i just, i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother.
you mean the mom you met in montauk. she was a cat?!
no, no-no, she was a human lady. this is the spirit of my mom lily, the one who killed herself.
are you sure she is in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
no dr. skeptismo! I am sure. first of all, okay, there is the feeling. (chandler shrugs) okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) my mother’s favourite fish is orange roughy... (joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) cats....like....fish! (ross and rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) hi, mommy. (rachel covers her mouth, in an “oh my god.” gesture) oh, i have not seen this smile in 17 years!
(to chandler) dude, phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...
(interrupting) let it go!!
hey!
umm, when were you going to tell me that you are going out with chip matthews?
now? is it okay if i go out with chip matthews?
nooo! it is not okay! i can not believe you would want to after what he did to me!
what, that little thing at the prom?
monica! i could not find him for two hours! he was having sex with amy welch!
come on, that was back in high school! how could that still bother you?
i mean why, of all people would you want to go out with chip?!
look, you and i went to different high schools...
okay, that does not help me, because we went to the same high school.
you went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
(shocked) they had to have that specially made?!
it was a project for one of the home ec classes.
(stunned) oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot!
back then, i thought that i would never, ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews, and now he is-he is called me up and asked me out. and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. i-i owe her this. i never let her eat.
oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)
oh, really?!
yeah. just, if it is possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
I will try.
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, i do not think any of them are going to work out.
yes, joey has a very careful screening process. apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
(is struggling with the cat) stop it! stop it! she keeps squirming, trying to get away! just like when she was alive.
so pheebs, how long is your mom going to be with us?
well, I am not sure. i mean, i guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there is y'know, a new mom. y'know, i think she is worried that y'know, she is going to, she is going to be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) well, that is not going to happen is it? noo. (gets up) okay, i have to return a call in the other room.
why can not you use the phone in here?
well, I am returning a call from a certain mom at the b-e-a-c-h. i just spelled the wrong word. (goes into monica’s room)
so, guys, am i crazy, or does phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?
ross, do not start.
come on, you-you can not tell me you actually believe that-that there is a woman inside that cat!
i believe it.
no you do not.
yes, i do.
no you do—y'know what, you are not going to suck me into this.
oh sure i am, because you always have to be right.
i do not always have to be—okay, okay. (starts to leave)
jurassic park could happen.
pretty nice?
you will have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
y'know, i, i really do not think we need a canoe.
all right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
(to peter) good for you!!
(entering) you guys, you are never going to believe what i just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (she is holding a flyer.) look kind of familiar?
(taking the flyer) apparently phoebe’s mother also goes by the name julio.
you guys, there is a little girl in soho looking for this cat. i mean, you know what that means?!
(looking at the flyer) yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
do we have to tell her?
yes, we have to tell her!
oh, but it is made her so happy.
(holds up a hand) little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) okay, y'know what, i have to go have dinner with my son, can i trust that when you see phoebe, you will tell her.
thank you.
i hate when ross is right!
he is right, is not he?
y'know what, i think this might be one of the times he is wrong.
oh-no, he is right.
(entering, with julio) hi. (sits down in the chair)
hi!
uh, pheebs, about your mom...
yeah?
(pause) how is that going?
so great. oh, we took a nap today and my mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
that is so sweet. (pause) I am going to get some coffee. (gets up and leaves)
(sliding into joey’s place on the couch to try and talk to phoebe) huh? what did ya say joe? I will be right there. (gets up and joins joey)
pheebs...
i just feel so, uhh.....
all right!!
I am coming already!!
jeez!
(running from the bathroom to her room, wearing only a towel) not yet! not yet! not yet! not yet! not yet! not yet! not yet! not yet! (gets to her room and closes the door, as rachel gets up to answer the door.)
hello, chip.
I am great! I am great. I have got a great job at bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I am not seeing anyone right now, I have never felt better about myself.
she will be out in a second. so, chip, how is umm, amy welch?
this is the unit for you my friend. sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
oh yeah! i got in there myself once. my roommate bet me five bucks that i could not, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. yeah. it was funny ‘til i started feeling like i was in a coffin.
oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) if i can not, I will knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) see?! i told ya!
sometimes i get in here just to get away from it! hey, a nickel!!
oh my god! you still have the chipper!
that is what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. y'know how a motorcycle is a chopper, and you are chip. nevermind.
wow! a lipper from chipper.
umm. well, there is rachel, and umm, i think that is it. how bout you?
is that all?
ohh, how is he?
is not he an architect now?
oh my god!!!
(still trapped in the entertainment center) what?!!
are you all right?!
yeah...
(let us him out) what happened?!!
(getting out) awww, man! he promised he would not take the chairs!!
what the hell happened?!! how were you locked in?!! and where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he did not think big enough to fit a grown man!
so—you got in voluntarily?!
i was tryin’ to make a sale!! oh, man, if i ever run into that guy again, do you know what I am going to do?
bend over?!!!
look, not that i enjoy talking about people who i went to high school with, ‘because i do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? like you, i do not even know where you work?
i do?
you still work at the multiplex?
thanks, I am set. do you still live with your parents?
wow! they really got you guys. your t.v. the chairs.
oh yeah, your microwave. the stereo.
(looking through a deck of cards) aww, man, he took the five of spades!! oh, no-no-no, here it is!
(entering) oh my god! what happened?
oh, umm, joey was born, and then 28 years later, i was robbed!!
(to monica) so, how was your date?
well, y'know how i always wanted to go out with chip matthews in high school?
um-hmm.
well, tonight, i actually went out with chip matthews in high school.
oh honey, I am sorry.
no, it is okay, not only did i get to go out with chip matthews, i got to dump chip matthews.
ohh! that is so great!
i know!
(entering) hey! so ah, what did the insurance company say?
oh, they said uh, “you do not have insurance here, so stop calling us.”
(seeing phoebe still with cat) you did not tell her?! (they all kind of shy away.) okay, fine! pheebs?
yeah? (sees ross) hi!
hi! listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. there are flyers all over the place.
I am sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)
hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
ohh. um-hmm. but y'know, she choose to find me. i mean, i have to respect her decision. right?
no! no! look—hey, enough is enough! look, i am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. this is a cat! okay, julio the cat! not mom! cat!
(she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) ross, how many parents have you lost?
none.
okay, then you do not know what it feels like when one of them comes back. do you? i believe this is my mother. even if I am wrong, who cares? just be a friend. okay? be supportive.
I am sorry.
okay.
i do not know what to say.
you could.... say you are sorry to her mom.
i think she would like that.
(goes over to julio) come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) mrs. buffay. sorry, about what i said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. when clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.
thank you. we both forgive you.
so honey, what are you going to do about the little girl?
yeah, okay, listen, umm, mom, i hope you know you still mean a lot to me. and you are welcome to come back anytime.
pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we would really appreciate it. (joey nods in agreement)
come on, mom, I will take you home.
I will go with you.
me too. (they all leave)
oh! y'know, I have got an extra futon.
dude, you do not have to brag! we got nothing here!!
hey guys!
hey, let me tell them!
sure.
joey is going to be a celebrity guest on a game show!
great!
really? which one?
(stopping joey from answering) ohh! fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
things you find in the ocean, (to joey) you are going to be on "pyramid"!!
oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
except for "match game"...
or "win, lose or draw".
what did i marry into?
would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
oh, i can not. we are throwing phoebe a bachelorette party.
yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
oh, and chandler and i have this stupid college alumni thing. i can not believe you get to meet donny osmond.
seriously?
(very excited) yeah-uh!
ross and i always wanted to be donny and marie.
you guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
oh god, that is right. i blocked that out.
(singing) "I am a little bit country"...
(singing) "...and I am a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
(to monica) I am leaving you.
so weird to see all these people again... oh my god, look, there is geoffrey cleric.
who?
he was roommates with john rosoff. he went out with andrea tamburino. she dumped him for michael skloff.
(looking around) did i go to this school?
hey, there is missy goldberg. you got to remember her.
(looks over at her) sure, nice.
dude. you are married to my sister.
you are right, by saying "nice" I am virtually licking her.
hey, i hear she is single again, d'you think i should ask her out?
are you asking permission to break the pact?
yes please.
hey. hey, check out the flyers for the band. i made  them on a macintosh in the computer room!
awesome, the name really stands out.
thanks to a little something called "helvetica bold 24 point"!
man, we are going to rock that asian student union!
hey!
hey, missy...
you know, our band is playing on friday.
yeah, yeah. you should come check us out. we are called "way! no way!".
fresh!
boss!
mint!
she is gone.
i know it. you know, I am totally going to ask her out.
dude, i was going to ask her out.
i said it first, bro.
well, i thought it first, holmes.
(angrily) look, if you did...
woha! wait... what are we doing? what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. i mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
totally. i had sex in high school...
me too. I am good at it.
all right, I would say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.
you got it.
all right, so that is missy goldberg, phoebe cates and molly ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
those are the pacts!
oh, and sheena easton. but we probably could not get her anyway.
oh, oh... maybe not you!
well, i officially give you permission to break the pact.
thank you. (they shake hands) all right, here i go. hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
your hands are shaking.
i know, and i can not stop sweating. (he walks towards missy)
(to gene) i know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax, I am just like you! (pause) only better looking and richer.
(on the screen there is the word "supermarket") uhm... ok. it is a store, like a supermarket. (there is a sound indicating he made a mistake as he should not have said 'supermarket'. the next word appears, "notebook") oh! i see-i see what i did. yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I am writing in my...
noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... damn it! (next word appears: "blueprint") oh, if I am building an house, the plan is not called the 'shmoo-print'... can not say that either? woha... hey... (the last word is "football field" and there are 5 seconds left) in high school, i once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
yeah! but that is not what they are looking for. (time's finished) oooh!
(to rachel) thank you so much for this.
oh, d'you like it?
oh my god, it is all so elegant! when is the dirty stuff starting?
what?
you know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.
pheebs, i... there is not going to be any flying about! we actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
oh, ok. i see what you are doing, that is fine. this is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. (she drinks her tea) hmmmm... raunchy!
seriously pheebs, it is not going to be that kind of a party.
really? so this is... this is my big send off in the married life? rachel this is the only bachelorette party I am ever going to have! I have got a big wad of ones in my purse! really? i mean, really? it is just tea?
nooo! phoebe, of course there is more! i mean, I will just go and talk to monica and get an eta on the pee-pee's!
ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
a spoon. your hands. your face!
paper, snow, a ghost!
a rock, a dog, the earth.
salami, anchovies, jam!
paper, snow, a ghost!
chickens?
oh!
ketchup!
relish!
oh.
yeah...
oh, so we did not win, but it is fun to play the game, right?
oh, wow! I am so sorry, ok? i promise, we will do better next time!
hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? (pause). yeah!
so, saturday night!
great!
oh, well, uh, this is going to sound kind of silly, but, do you remember my roommate chandler bing?
it is been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
that is ok. uh, anyway, well he and i both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we did not want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kind of made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
yeah, why?
you did?
(angrily) and on my turf?
(to rachel) hey, where is this guy, it is been over an hour!
well, he is coming from jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
who is it?
(pretends to be shocked) uh! the police!
(excited, running back to her seat) oh!
what is the matter, officer? has someone been bad? (looks over to phoebe and she opens the door, and to their dismay, the stripper is an old, short, fat guy who looks exhausted)
are you going to be ok, officer, uhm,...
...if-you-say-so.
oh, god!
rachel?
yeah?
are you kidding?
all right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
how old is your phonebook?
oh my god, this man is going to get naked in my apartment!
oh god no, i do not want to see him take his clothes off!
oh, no! i mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! you big piece of eye candy!
this is how i look when I am turned on!
shocking!
three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
no, that is ok, let us me just get my check book!
no, you are not going to pay him, he did not do anything!
i do not care. we are not paying you 300 dollars for this.
oh yeah, okay. I am uptight. yeah, that is why i do not want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what i can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at monica and rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)
I am sorry, did you say all man or old man?
(walks towards phoebe and the stripper) uh, look, officer... uhm sir...
(to henrietta) my friend rachel has a kid. i totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)
oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (next word: "rotunda") pass. (next word: "filibuster" stares at it a moment) pass. (henrietta is looking very confused) (next word: "addendum" 4 seconds remaining) okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
oh, then pass. (next word: "joint session", but time's up, joey acts very disappointed)
(to chandler) you made out with missy goldberg. how could you do that, after you promised me?
(to the two guys) excuse me. (chandler and ross move away from them). that did not make us sound gay at all!
you broke the pact!
ross, that was 16 years ago!
that does not matter! we are talking about the foundation of our friendship.
i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (ross just stares at him) all right, look, if we are really going to do this... it is not like you never broke one of the pacts.
i did not.
oh really?
no.
oh really!?
no!
adrienne turner!! (a girl behind them turns around)
i never did anything with adrienne turner.
oh please, and you knew how much i liked her.
i do not know what... you are talking about.
really?
i can not believe we are at a real college party! (rachel laughs excitedly) i have to pee so bad!
this is so awesome! college guys are so cute!
hey, you have got a boyfriend!
i know. but if some guy who looks like corey haim wants to kiss me tonight, I am sooo going to let them! (they spot chandler)
look, there is chandler. you knew, that stupid friend of ross'. said I am fat. you know I have already lost 4 pounds!
it... you can so totally tell.
i know!
well let us see. maybe he knows where ross is. (they walk towards chandler) hey, how is it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).
are not you...?
yeah, rachel. and this (points to monica) is ross' sister, monica. we met at thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).
(smiling at monica) right. (to rachel) so how are you doing?
bitchin'
hi monica.
hi chandler. it is really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) not. (she and rachel giggle a little and chandler looks unimpressed)
of-kay. I will see if i can find ross. (goes off to find ross.)
oh my god rach. bean bag chairs.
oh.
do not let me sit in one of those. we will be here for days.
listen adrienne, you can not tell chandler about this.
cool! (they start kissing again and chandler looks shocked)
i did not know you knew about that.
well, i did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) that is when i wrote the song: "betrayal in the common room".
(looks disappointed in himself) man... i... I am sorry.
look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-of-ong time ago.
so, eh. i made out with adrienne and you made out with missy. well i guess we are even.
(smiling a little nervously) hmm mmmhm..
we are even, right?
(sighs) just one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night that i wanted to get back at you. so i thought, who does ross like the more than anybody?
(thinks about it for a few seconds) what did you do to my mom?
not her!
i am sooo drunk.
that is weird. I have had the same number of beers as you and i do not feel anything at all. (chandler approaches)
soo... you girls having fun?
for your information, ass munch, I have lost four pounds. maybe even five with all the dancing. (a guy enters holding a pizza box)
oh that is me! (she runs to the pizza guy)
(finishing the last of her drink) i am soo not going to do good on my sats tomorrow.
well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
(sarcastic) oh yeah. there is a plan! why do not i just start taking my smart pills now?
well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
(blushing) oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards chandler and whispers "oh my god!")
so where are you applying to?
oh well, you know, i think it is kind of really important that i go somewhere where there is sun, so I am sort of... (chandler leans in an kisses her) (she pulls away) hey!
I am in college and I am in a band.
(she considers it for a second) yeah okay. (she puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)
you know, it is fine. we will pay you.
no, wait. no there is got to be something else that you can do. i mean, what skills do you have?
so maybe something in an office.
or you could teach stripping. you know, share your gift, pass the torch.
there you go. okay, do you think you are going to be okay?
(after a pause) finish it!
your last dance. do it for us.
(to phoebe) really?
yeah, yeah. he deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
oh this is so ho-of-ot!
oh no, no, no, do not stop!
(nervously) yeah...
i-i-i do not know. types of trees?
(sympathetic) oh, I am so sorry. i do not know any spanish words.
things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
things that burn.
dude, dude! i think you are losing it.
oh, oh, oh... what a dog says.
(instantly) pizza toppings, next!
oh, oh, oh... (5 seconds left)
girls chandler could never get?
where? (looking around)
hey, where is rachel?
she and phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
did you know chandler kissed rachel?
what? when was this?
nineteen eighty seven. the weekend you guys visited me at school.
oh my god! that is wild!
yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it does not matter.
well, it matters to me.
why?
because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time.
you kissed her that night too?
two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
seriously, where did this happen?
okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips. i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back. it was only for a second, but... it was amazing. and now, now i find out that you kissed her first.
oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?
mine.
I am pretty sure i put her on my bed.
no, she was definitely on my bed.
why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
well, then who was on my bed?
(screeching) oh! oh, oh! (holding her hand in front of her mouth)
(realizing) no! no, no!
yes! (chandler gets an "oh no!" look on his face)
you were under the pile of coats?
i was the pile of coats!
oh my god!
you were my midnight mystery kisser?
you were my first kiss with rachel?
you were my first kiss ever?
what did i marry into?
oh, crap!
ow ow ow. ow ow ow ow. ow ow ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
hi. uh, my friend here was taking down our christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
ow ow ow. ow ow ow. ow ow ow.
okay, ooh, alright. name, address... okay, in case of emergency, call?
you.
really?
yeah.
oh, that is so sweet. (touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) oh gosh, love you. insurance?
oh, yeah, check it. definitely, i want some of that.
(no longer touched) you do not have insurance?
why, how much is this going to cost?
i have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
wel-wel-well what are we going to do?
well there is not much we can do.
(like a big baby) um... unless, unless i use yours.
hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
(tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did i just put as my "in case of emergency" person?
(looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway) that is insurance fraud.
well, alright, then, forget it. (getting up to go) might as well just go home. ow ow ow ow!
(jumping up to make rachel sit down) okay, okay. i hate this.
thank you. thank you. i love you.
(to the nurse) hi, (tiny laugh) um, I am going to need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).
(tiny laugh) i am really an idiot. (tiny laugh) you see, i was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) i put mine.
(tiny laugh) yep, that is me, (tiny laugh) i am that stupid (tiny laugh).
i had a dream last night where i was playing football with my kid.
no, no, with him. (he mimes holding the baby like a football.) I am on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and i, i know I have got to do something because the tampa bay defence is comin' right at me.
tampa bay's got a terrible team.
right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I am thinkin' they can take us. and so i uh, hah-hah, i just heave it down field.
what are you crazy? that is a baby!
he should take the sack?
anyway, suddenly I am down field, and i realise that I am the one who is supposed to catch him, right? only i know there is no way I am going to get there in time, so i am running, and running, and that, that is when i woke up. see i, i am so not ready to be a father.
hey, you are going to be fine. you are one of the most caring, most responsible men in north america. you are going to make a great dad.
yeah, ross. you and the baby just need better blocking.
oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the rainbow room? is it real expensive?
well, only if you order stuff.
I am takin' ursula tonight. it is her birthday.
wo-wo-whoa. what about phoebe's birthday?
when is that?
tonight.
oh, man. what are the odds of that happening?
you take your time.
there it is! so what are you going to do?
what can i do? look, i do not want to do anything to screw it up with ursula.
and your friend phoebe?
well, if she is my friend, hopefully she will understand. i mean, would not you guys?
man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you would be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
yes? (jumping as rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.
are not you a little cute to be a doctor?
i meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, i meant young, young to be a doctor. oh good, rach.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
uh, you left out the stupid part.
not stupid. the very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and i said "yes."
i think it is totally insane, i mean, they work for the hospital. it is like returning to the scene of the crime. you know, i say we blow off the dates.
what? monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
alright, what have we learned so far?
what the hell are you doing? you scared the crap outta me.
was that the cake?
yeah, yeah. i got a lemon schmush.
come on, she will be here any minute.
i hope it is okay.
oh...
(reading) "happy birthday peehe."
well maybe we can make a, a, a 'b' out of one of those roses.
(still annoyed) yeah, we will just use our special cake tools.
hey, what is going on?
oh, we just...
(delighted) oh, oh, oh! this is so great! oh my god! this was not at all scary. hi everybody. hi betty! betty, hi! (thrilled) you found betty! oh my god! (hugging people) this is great. everybody i love is in the same room, (still happy) where is joey?
did you see betty?
dad, before i was born, did you freak out at all?
dad, dad, dad, I am talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "oh my god I am going to be a father" kind of a thing?
no, no, dad, i was just wondering.
thanks, dad, really, i ju... you know, i just, i just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
no, we can go to williamsburg.
rachel, the cute doctors are here.
(entering from her room) okay, coming!
hi, come on in.
hi, geoffrey.
hi.
oh, that is great. look at that.
it is uh...
okay, listen, I am thinking, why do not we just tell them who we really are? i mean, it will be fine, i really think it will be fine.
it will not be fine. we will get in trouble.
oh, monica! would you stop being such a wuss?
a wuss? excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
i said we are not going to do it, okay? sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
(resenting the truth) i am not a baby! you know what? i swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
sure, every time, you are such a princess...
you know what?
what?
you know what?
what!?
you know what?
(getting angry) what!!?
every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
hello! here we go!
(as monica) thanks! I have been here about six years, and rachel moved in a few months ago.
(as rachel) yeah... (joining the others) ..see, i was supposed to get married, but, um, i left the guy at the altar.
(as rachel) yeah... yeah, i know it is pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that is me. (indicating a dish on the table) why do not you try the hummus?
(as monica) aahh, I am a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
(as monica) yeah it is, mostly because i get to boss people around, which i just love to do.
(as rachel) (suddenly laughing) oh, god, i am so spoiled... that is it!
(as monica) and by the way, have i mentioned that back in high school, i was a cow?
(as rachel) i used to wet my bed.
(as monica) i use my breasts to get other people's attention.
(as rachel) (revealing her anger to point at her best friend) we both do that!
(as rachel) hi, dad. no, no, it is me. (getting up to move further away from rachel) li-listen, dad, i can not talk right now, um, but there is something, um... there is something that I have been meaning to tell you...
would you excuse me for a second?
(as rachel) remember back in freshman year? (talking fast before rachel can catch her) well, billy dreskin and i had sex on your bed.
(on phone) daddy... daddy... daddy, why whyyy would i sleep with billy dreskin? his father tried to put you out of business! (rachel turns to monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so dr.green can not hear, while mouthing "you are...") ...dead!
ross, he is got the remote again.
good. maybe he can switch it back.
maybe not.
hello? (listens) um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at ross who takes the remote from marcel, then turns off the tv) okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she is here.
it is the woman from the hospital admissions office. she says there is a problem with the form. oh, god, oh god...
i do not know! why do not you just explain? what do they want? find out what they want!
okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.
(taking the phone) hello, this is monica... yeah??? oh... (smiles at rachel to reassure her) okay, yes, we will be right, we will be right down.(listens) thank you. (hangs up)
what?
we forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
ohhh... (slumping in relief) okay, you were right. you were right! this was just not worth it.
thank you.
okay, let me just change.
yes.
(entering quietly) hey.
hi.
trouble?
your sister stood me up the other night.
oh, no. do not you hate it when people are not there for you?
well did you try calling her?
I have been trying for two days. when i called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. i can not believe she is blowin' me off.
hey.
um you, you got a minute?
so.
um, oh, i got you a birthday present.
right, like the kind you...
how did you know i was coming?
i can not believe you did this.
i can not believe you... (holding up joey's cardigan) ..did this.
so... what is the deal with umm, you and joey?
does he know?
joey. you know, um, he is really nutsy about you.
you got me.
so, um, are you going to call him?
no, joey.
no. no food with a face.
yeah, you too.
(as monica) hi, remember us?
(as rachel) um, okay. you just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, i-i, i put the wrong name again. (little laugh) because um...
(as rachel) i am. I am that stupid. (little laugh.)
(as monica) yeah, and and, I am just going to pay for this with a check.
(as monica) yeah, i know... (mirroring her friend) ..I am I am just not that bright either.
okay, worst case scenario. say you never feel like a father.
uh-huh.
say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this.
do you have a point?
you know, you think i would.
what is up with the simian?
it is just a fur ball.
okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
yours, i just got 43 points for 'kidney'.
no, no, you got zero points for 'idney'.
i had a 'k'. where is where is my 'k'?
you have got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'k'!
no, no you do not understand the animal hospital is way across town he is choking i do not know what else to do.
what is going on?
marcel swallowed a scrabble tile.
oh.
lady, he is people. he has a name, okay? he watches jeopardy! he he touches himself when nobody's watching. please, please have a heart!
michael.
what?
(as rachel) monica.
(as monica) oh.
(as rachel) hi.
(as monica) hi.
(as ursula) hey.
urse...
..ah, what are you doing here? I have been trying to call you.
(as ursula) listen, um...
no, no, no, do not say "listen." i know that "listen." I have said that "listen."
(as ursula) I am sorry.
i do not get it. what happened? what about everything you said under the bridge?
(as ursula): yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) you know you, you should just forget about what i said under the bridge, i was talkin' crazy that night, i was so drunk!
you do not drink.
(as ursula) that is right, i do not... but i was, i was drunk on you!
oh, urse... (he tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)
(as ursula) okay, yeah, so it is not going to work.
why? is it because I am friends with phoebe?
(as ursula) if it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
(thinking carefully) no. no, i, i could not do that.
(as ursula) um, then yes, it is because of phoebe! so, you know, it is either her or me.
then, uh, then I am sorry.
(as ursula) you know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) you are going to be really, really hard to get over.
i know...
i do not know whether it is just because we are breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
really?
pheebs?
(automatically) yeah. oooh... (she is sprung.)
he looks so tiny.
we just got the message.
is he alright?
yeah. the doctor got the 'k' out. he also found an 'm' and an 'of.
we think he was trying to spell out 'monkey.'
well, the doctor says he is going to be fine, he is just sleeping now.
(tapping ross on his shoulder) so, you feel like a dad yet?
no, why?
hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad.
oh, look, he is waking up!
(quietly) hey, fella! how you doing?
aqui est�. (here it is!)
�a qui�n pidio el pollo general tso? (who ordered general sal's chicken?)
�pudo aver sido general tso! (it could have been general sal!)
�mira, mira, el viejo desnudo est� haciendo el hula hoop! (look, look, ugly naked guy is doing the hula!)
�hola, amigos! (hey, everybody!)
mira, ross, marcel se llevo el control remoto. (look, ross, marcel's got the remote.)
�lo que sucedio es que no le gusta la tele! (the thing is, he doesn`t like the program!)
hi!
hey!
hey!
we are just here to say goodbye, we are off to ohio.
oh, right! your adoption interview!
yep, we are going to meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
i can not believe it. when you guys come back, you are going to have a baby! that is so weird!
and so incorrect!
she is only a couple of months pregnant. she liked our application but who knows if she is going to like us.
come on, she is going to love you guys!
uhm, thank you, but we are really trying not to get our hopes up.
and a lot could still get in our way.
yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
what are you going to name the baby?
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word.
but just think, ok? what if everything goes right? what if this woman does pick you guys?
oh my god. she is going to pick us!
so we are standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
you know, i know that things could still go wrong but if they do not? if this works out, we are going to have a baby chandler, a baby!
yes, but...
oh my god, it is going to work! we are going to make it work! I am going to be a mummy and (to chandler) you are going to be a daddy! all right, I will see you suckers. I am going to get me... a baby! {she leaves)
oh, screw it, I am going to be a daddy!!
(to joey) hey, who is phoebe with?
I am going to say someone I am going to have sex with. (the girl leaves and phoebe goes toward the couch) (to phoebe) hey!
hey!
so... who is your friend?
oh, that is sarah. no, no. do not you get any ideas, ok? no, I am not setting you up with any more of my friends!
ow, why, why, why?
because you will date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
oh, name one friend of yours that i did that with.
mandy.
mandy, uh? uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
no.
i know why i do not remember her, huh? (he winks at rachel)
do you think I am someone else?
ok, i may not have treated your friends well in the past, but i have grown up a lot, really. honest, rach?
well, believe it or not, it is true. when joey and i were together, he was wonderful. he was thoughtful and mature. and for the one week that we went out, he did not sleep with anybody else!
(pointing at himself) growth!
fine, I will give you her number.
ok, thank you. and i promise you i will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) mandy.
sarah!
saraaah.
(entering) hey!
hi!
hey you guys, i need some fashion advice.
oh!
(he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) how does this look?
well, it is a little low... pick up a little... (ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) there you go! (pause) now throw it away!
c'mon! this looks good!
ross, please, trust me. i buy 30 fashion magazines a month. now, i do not know who is running for president or who that... nato guy is, but i do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
damnit! i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool!
well, you know, if you want fashion help, rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow. you are more than welcome to come with us, right?
really? that would be great. i mean, i have to do something, she kind of teased me about how i dress.
i can see why, nice shirt!
you are wearing the same shirt.
stupid gap on every corner!
ok, thank you.(the man leaves) uh, well this is it. are you ok?
yeah. just weird, you know. it is like: "hi, I am chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?"
uh, we are going to be great.
you are going to be great.
well... obviously!
hi. it is so, so nice to meet you.
thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
ok.
that is what our friends call us.
i do not know about that.
(astonished) i do not think that is exactly...
(overlapping) let her finish, doctor.
hey!
hey.
oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night.
well...
yeah! so you are going to call this one back?
nope.
what are you talking about? sarah's great!
oh, really? you know what your great friend did? we are out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) we are getting along, having a really nice time. i was thinking she was really cool. and then, out of nowhere...
that is it? that is why you will not go out with her again? so, she took some fries, big deal!
hey, hey, look! it is not about a few fries... it is about what the fries represent.
what?
all food!
I am sorry, i can not believe i set you up with such a monster!
hey, hey, hey, hey. look. i take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! the more, the better! all right? just do not order a garden salad and then eat my food! that is a good way to lose some fingers!
(to rachel) oh
hi
thank god you are here. listen to this!
what?
joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
oh! oh, no!
what? you know about the plate thing?
oh, yeah. joey does not share food. i mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
(to joey) you would not let her have a grape?
oh no! not me! emma!
(mad and pointing a finger to himself) joey does not share food!
well, i still think that it is a stupid reason not to call someone again. you are calling her! and if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
(he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) i like that! a sharing buffer! yeah! I will order some extra fries! maybe a plate of onion rings. yeah. and a shrimp cocktail. and some buffalo wings. maybe an individual pizza, uh? and some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) what were we talking about?
(to ross) this place is awesome!
you know, we should just go, I am not going to find anything here! this stuff is ridiculous!
ah, this place is great!
wow!
rach, come on, I am not going to wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) nothing silver. (rachel sighs). ok? nothing with hair! (rachel sighs again) and nothing with padlocks on it! (rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).
ross, look, i know that some of this stuff is out there, but i mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). i mean, this is just beautiful!
(feeling the fabric) wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). three hundred and fifty dollars?
yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
wow!
yeah!
actually this looks like pretty good! yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there is a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) boys will be boys?
what? they will be!
all right, that is it, I am getting out of here.
no, no, no, no! ross, wait! come on! you know, there is other stuff. here is a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
yes, they will! you know what you should do? just go take a walk, all right? i know your size and I am... I am going to pick up some really good stuff for you.
really?
yes! and i know what looks sexy on guys. please, just wear what i suggest, and she is going to go nuts for you.
so, you are saying, uh, if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers?
(to phoebe) why do men keep talking to me like this?
so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that is important to you?
amen.
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
uh, good hands. (she holds chandler hands) healing hands.
it says “do it!”. and behold she did adopt onto them a baby. and it was good.
yeah, wow.
oh, you know, my flock is good, i mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. good flock. flock, flock, flock.
no-ot for me it does not.
yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
you should be. you are really on top of stuff..
we do not?
oh my god, this is great! this is so great! (to chandler, who looks bewildered). did you hear that?
yeah, i did.
(to erica) hey, thank you. thank you so much. (they hugs). you are so going to heaven!
we got some really great stuff!
yeah, yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got.
oh! really? do you want to try some of them on for me?
oh! okay. wait, are we in joey's imagination?
(looking into one of her shopping bags) oh no! i took one of ross' bags by
oh, well, ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
(to joey) so? what do you think? (shows himself - joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)
i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
(not getting it) yeah! yeah! rachel picked it out for me. she told me to trust her and you know what? I am glad i did! i turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
(now laughing a little) dude, i really do not think you should be wearing that.
oh, i see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
(looking a little agitated now) looks like someone is the ladies!!
you are just jealous because you could not pull this off. yeah, now if you will excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) i have a date. (as he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) see? (to joey) all eyes on me!
we are not signing those papers.
why not?
it is wrong. they made a mistake. they think we are somebody else.
god works in mysterious ways.
you have got to stop!
but she liked us.
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.
well, if you think about it, i am kind of like a reverend. i mean, as a chef, i serve god, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)
your veal chop is $34,95!
c'mon chandler, i think we have been given an opportunity. i mean, the mistake has already been made. they are writing up the paper right now.
but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?
(very emotional) because... we may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
i know..
i mean, who knows how long it is going to take for someone else to give us a baby? what if, what if no one ever picks us?
oh, honey..
(almost crying) please.. please, we are so close.
monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it is going to.
(realizes chandler is right. she is almost crying) okay, right. (they hug)
so, we will tell the truth and who knows, maybe she will like us for us.
(sniffing) maybe she will. uh! why could not i have been a reverend?
you are jewish.
technicality!
oh, that looks great! good ordering!
oh, i did not know you liked french fries. help yourself! what is mine is yours. (sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)
uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
how about those fries though, huh? (holds the plate between sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)
(spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) you are beautiful, you know that?
oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)
(visibly annoyed) now look what you did!!
i do not like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
well, i did not mean it!
I am sorry, I am overreacting. okay, it is just when it comes to food, i have certain rules, okay, i mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) there are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you do not do (he takes a bite from it).
oh! you are going to love it! (the girl is looking in the other direction as ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I am so glad, we are finally doing this.
here (gets behind her to help. when the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt ross is wearing. they look at each other, shocked. they abruptly put their coat back on) so this was fun! (they leave the room and head into opposite directions)
i really am sorry about, you know..before. i just want to make sure you know that i really do like you.
(jokingly) well, stuffed clams.
uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
(more to himself than anyone else) so stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to
oh, all right, I will just have what she is having instead.
oh yeah, sure. no problem.
sure i do. (holding up his own dessert) coule?
(laughing) really?
yeah, of course. i can control myself. (laughs uneasily and sarah leaves the room)
(to the torte) stop staring at me!
why, just a tiny little...
oh-oh!
I am not even sorry.
hey.
(pointing to a picture on the table) i-is... is that a picture?
look, doctor!
the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and I am not a doctor.
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you would like.
well, our names really are monica and chandler. we are from new york.
yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)
well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) "bore false witness"... see i could be a reverend.
but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
well, you do not have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
erica wait!
you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we have been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we do not know how long it is going to be before we can get another chance again.
erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and I am in advertising.
but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she is loving and devoted and caring. and do not tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can not give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, I will learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she is already there. she is a mother... without a baby... please?
you still want that baby?
god bless you chandler bing!
turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
(nods) so, why are you still wearing it?
because it is soft... hey, so how was your date?
ooh... not so good.
well, looks like it is just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
yeah, and you know what? we could do a lot worse.
(shouting to ross) joey does not share food!
I am fine, thanks.
(to monica) yeah, see, i can not pull of baby-doll can i?
no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I am going to get some tea.
okay.
hiya doing pumpkin?
nope. (chandler nods in agreement.)
so it looks like it is going really well for you two, huh?
(shocked) oh my god!
i think that is so great! when are you going to ask her?
i swear, i promise. i promise. oh my god, I am so excited! {and i just can not hide it! I am about to lose control and i think i like it! sorry, just could not resist it.} all right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. okay? because y'know, she cries when they die, and there is the whole funeral…
okay. bye!
so, what movie should we see?
(sitting down) gary's going to ask you to move in with him!!
what?! really?!
he just told me at the counter. he made me promise not to tell, but i could not hold it in any longer!
i can not believe this!
(terrified) right, because it is fast. because, it is so fast. it is fast!
relax! it is phoebe! not you!
oh! good for you pheebs, way to go! (breathes a sigh of relief)
no, but it is fast. is not it?
ohhhh!
no, i like him a lot but i do not think I am ready for this!
so, what are you going to do?
i do not know. I will just handle it—I will ask you to talk to him!
me?! why me?
because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him a…man!
I will try, but I am not sure what good it would do, y'know? because I am a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be.
that is so sweet! (she kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)
(to phoebe, behind monica's back) still terrified, I will take care of it. no problem. (when monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he will do it to phoebe.)
hey ross, is uh, is staten island really an island?
uh-huh, that is why they call it staten island.
ohhh. i thought it was like long island.
(he catches the ball and pauses, staring at joey in disbelief) also an island.
hey, what time is it?
(looks at his watch) 2:17.
wow! you realize that we have been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
are you serious?!
yeah. i realized it about a half-hour ago but i did not want to say anything because i did not want to jinx it.
wow! we are pretty good at this! hey! we totally forgot about lunch!
oh, i-i, i think that is the first time i ever missed a meal! (checks his pants.) yeah, my pants are a little loose!
(entering) hey, you guys…
hey!
is monica here?
all right listen umm, i just bought something I am not sure she is going to like it, and it is going to seem a little crazy, but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl.
you bought shawn cassidy!
noo! i wish! okay, you ready?
okay! (she goes and gets her surprise and when she returns with it, ross stares in shock.) check it out!
what-what is it?!
what the hell is that?!!
it is a, it is a cat!
that, is not a cat! {i have to agree with joey on this one.}
yes it is!
why is it inside out?!
excuse me! but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat!
how much did you pay for that?
well, it was a little extravagant, but i a pretty good deal.
yeah? how much?
a thousand bucks.
on a cat??!!!!
it is not a cat!
all right listen ball boys! my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! i mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
free cats do that too, y'know. {which reminds me, if i might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably will not die on you in a week and a half. if you want a leash, go to the pet shop. if you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it is life. now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
it is not a cat!
ugh! look you guys, I am really excited about this! okay? i do not care what you think! I am going to go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson. (they both glare at her.) well, what am i going to call her? fluffy?!
(to joey) hey, you want to get something to eat or uh, do you want to see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? huh?
uhh, the ball thing.
yeah?
hey ross, would not it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
uhh, yeah it would! let us do it!
okay!
(catches the ball) uh-oh.
what?
i have to pee. and rachel's in the bathroom!
man, i did not think we were going to make it!
i know! (looks at the ball in his hands.) do not switch hands, okay?
hey ladies! what are you in here for? (laughs at his joke.)
gary, I am here to report a crime.
it is a crime that you and i do not spend more time together.
well, i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe, we should have a talk. man to uh, me.
uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are going to be y'know, live-living together!
you mean scared.
scared? happy?
i am trying to open your eyes, my man! do not you see, if you lived with phoebe she is always going to be there. you are going to get home, she is there. you go to bed, she is there. you wake up and oh yes, she is there!
were you are parents happy, or something?
wow, y'know when you say it, it does not sound so scary.
yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now! maybe i should in with monica!
(pause) yeah, you are right about that.
…now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws! how did it get there?!
maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
(entering) hey guys!
hi!
joey, i left my watch on the counter last night. (goes to the counter) it was right here, where is it?
i do not know.
all right, come on, I am-I am late for work!
how do you know? you do not have a watch.
guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
oh, i do not know…. yeah, can not do it.
what?!
monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!
yeah, we have not dropped it in… (looks to ross.)
2 hours, 27 minutes.
really?!
(on phone, faking she is sick) i-I am not going to be able to make it into work today, i do not feel very good. (joey makes a high throw and monica has to catch it way over her head.) (not sounding sick) yes!! (realizes what she just did.) (sounding sick again) wow! uh, for a second there i thought i was really better, but I am not. (hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)
hey rach!
hey.
check it out! almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
oh, wow! congratulations, that is quite a waste of time.
rach?
yeah?
you have scratches all over you, what happened? (rachel's arms are covered with scratches.)
well, it is my cat.
(shocked) what?!
oh yeah, i got a cat.
i do not want a cat!
oh, do not worry, it is not a cat.
yeah.
you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. i mean, it is not sweet, it is not cute, i even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. and i swear, i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me i know it is saying, "rachel!"
does not sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
(to rachel) what?! you paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
well, i was going to let you play with it.
hi!
hmm, did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?
yes i did, and i think you should do it.
what?!
he is a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
you are useless! freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! the one thing! and you can not even do that right! god!
I am sorry. (pause) if you ask me, I would move in with him.
ohh!! god! (gary enters and she sees him) ooh! (to chandler) get out of here, good for nothing.
hey gar!
yeah! okay. (they move to the couch.)
thanks! okay. (they sit down.)
yeah?
uh-hmm.
no that is not true. if you are not moving forward, you are just staying still. and staying still is good. watch this. (she stays still for a brief second.)
yeah?
that is so sweet. but do not you think it is a little too soon? i mean there is so much we do not know about each other.
i just—i do not want us to jump into something we are not ready for.
i really do not want to mess up what we have. I am just—I am worried it is going to be a big mistake.
which is why my answer is yes!
uh-huh! (they hug.) I am so…happy. (she is not happy.)
(catching the ball) monica! stop throwing it so hard! we are on the same team!
four hours? you guys have been doing this for four hours?
that is right baby.
all right, let me in. (he jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
(jumping in front of him) no-no! do not do it! do not!
what?
he is a dropper!
oh yeah, that is right!
I am not a dropper!
it is really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?
it is throwing and catching!
all right. (he gently tosses the ball to chandler who catches it.)
oh! oh! that is so hard. (starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to monica.)
whoa-whoa you guys, it is not a cat!
oh my—oh good god!
(she is wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) i give up you guys, i do not know what I am going to do with this thing!
baking it did not help, huh?
so, why do not you just take it back to where you got it?
i tried! they will not take her back.
maybe that is because she is a minion of the anti-christ.
rach, why will not they take it back?
well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. i mean, what am i going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
no mon that is not the point. I am out a thousand dollars, I am all scratched up, and I am stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (storms out.)
oh my god, the cat's made my eyes water! do not-do not throw it to me! my vision's been compromised!! (quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) oh god! okay. okay. it is okay. man, that was close.
yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
we are moving in together! is not it great! yay!
i know, I am so excited!
well, you are not more excited than i am! no way! I am the most excited!
okay, yeah, I will see you later! do not forget about the moving in!
so you are moving in with him. what happened?
i could not tell him no. he got so sad. maybe it will be all right. i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I will save on stamps.
why, do you write him a lot?
no, i just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. do not they?
oh, I am sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
no, nothing.
yeah.
no, as soon as something opens up we will move right in. unless it does not have a pool, i need a pool. (turns away from him.)
uh-huh!
(sits down) yeah, i feel great. because we are moving in together.
yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (pause) can i get some water?
umm, yeah! today's.
(looks at the paper) are these for rent! i thought people were just bragging!
yes. yes! fine! i am someone! you want me to say it? i have doubts! (pause) I am sorry! (puts her head down.)
yeah?
that is so sweet.
living with you would make me happy.
no, i really want to live with you! i want to move in with you!
yes. definitely! yes! let us live in an apartment that we both live in! (hugs him.)
oh wait, one sec. one sec. (goes to the mirror) hey you! behind the glass! who are you looking at! I have always wanted to say that when i was in one of these rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!
show cat! quality show cat! show cat! (a woman approaches.)
it is not a baby! it is a cat!
oh no! no! it is actually—it is very sweet. it is very sweet. look! (goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) yeah, do you want it?
well, so then what are you doing to me? okay? just get out of here! all right? move on!
yes! thank you! exactly! you want it?
oh, terrific! that will be $2,000.
okay, a thousand.
well, i do, but you are just going to have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
(makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) obviously you know how to haggle, so I am not going to try and take you on. okay? so $800 and i do not call the cops because you are robbing me blind! blind! (covers her eyes) just take cat, leave the money, and run away! run away! (uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) damnit! (to the cat) cat, can not you at least smile or something?! (the cat hisses at her again, it sounds like rachel) okay, did anybody just hear that? anybody?
I am starving!
come on guys! suck it up! we are closing in on ten hours! it is gut-check time!
i do not know who made you the boss? all right? we (ross and him) invented this game!
please! i made this game what it is.
not fun anymore?
I am still hungry!
all right, there is some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? are you with me?
i am!
all right! let us go! (runs to the door.) let us go team monica! (the guys all stop and stare at her) all right, we can work out the name later.
rachel! what is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
it is not! I am defrosting a chicken. (pause) oh, i uh sold mrs. whiskerson.
oh, thank god!
did you get your money back?
yeah, 15 hundred dollars.
wow! you made a profit!
oh yeah, there you go. (hands over the pillow.)
oh good, great! I will-I will keep that in mind. (turns and walks away.)
i like waking up with you too. (looks out the window) oh! it is such a beautiful morning. (some birds are singing outside the window) oh, i can stay here all day.
we could have breakfast in bed…
okay. (he grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) oh! oh no.
all right! come on monica! look alive! come on, look alive!
(entering) oh good, you are all up.
phoebe! it is 6 of the clock in the morning! why are not you at gary's?
oh yeah, that is over.
come on! gary's such a great guy! whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
he shot a bird!
oh that is over!
phoebe, are you okay?
yeah. yeah, I will be alright.
oh hey, here pheebs. (he throws her the ball.)
(catches it) nah, i do not feel like playing. (she sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)
it is okay. it is okay. just pretend that it did not happen! okay? no one needs to know! i mean, phoebe's not an official ballplayer! i mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
phoebe, honey, want to get some breakfast?
yeah!
okay! okay, let us race! first one there wins! ha-ha! (runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)
you guys want to eat here?
man that was great! huh? can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
i know. my arm is killing me.
no, i meant with the dropper over here. (points at chandler.)
y'know, how did i get this reputation as a dropper? okay? I am anything but a dropper. (we see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I am not going to describe them, you will have to see them.)
okay, guys, listen, do not forget that tomorrow is the day that emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep ross's mind off of it.
oh, yeah, good idea.
hey man, what is up?
(sits down at the table) oh, eh, just thinking about emily getting married tomorrow. (joey panics.)
ooh, ross, look! look! (points behind ross.)
(turning and looking) what? where?
right over there! right there! look-look-look!
what am i looking at?
(to the rest of the gang) somebody help me out here!
(entering, with gary) hey!
hey!
monica, I am sorry i did not come by last night. i was out with gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. we saw and prevented crimes.
you got to go on a ride along?!
uh-huh!
i want to go on a ride along!
me too!
yeah, yeah! me too!
yeah.
well, i like danger.
tonight? you-you did not say it was going to be at nighttime.
hey!
hey! oh, I am so glad you are home, i thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
ohh, thank god! finally!
okay, I have broken them down into categories. okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… and then what I have done is I have cross-referenced them by subject. right? so if you are looking up, oh let us say birthdays and dogs, you get photo 152. see? (hands her the photo.)
ohh, it is me and la poo! wow! i miss that dog.
you can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
great! thanks!
all right, hand me that other box of photos; that is the very last one.
okay.
oops. sorry! well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
i had not! photo 152 was a prototype.
ohhhh. honey, honey, honey, it is okay, it is okay honey. I am going to fix you a drink, huh? maybe a margarita?
ross has the blender! ugh, everything's just falling apart!
no honey, it is okay! listen, I will got to ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
all right, he is keys are in the drawer. y'know what? i also need some cash.
okay, you want me to stop at the atm?
nah, while you are at ross's if you see any lying around…
what?!
what?! i-i-i do not, i do not do that!
(to gary) that was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
it is starting to get dark out there.
(to gary) he told you everything! i mean you totally cracked him!
(laughing) okay. (deadpan) but it is officially nighttime.
oh hey, gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
it is the—chandler!!
(returning from a deli) okay, i got it! this place makes the best sandwich in the world!
oh-ho, yeah!
yep!
(dejected) yeah okay. (to chandler) even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
your tax dollars?
yeah, okay.
(leans in and takes a sniff of joey's sandwich) wow! that sandwich really does smell good.
did i say you could smell it?!
i can not smell your sandwich?
half the taste is in the smell! you-you are sucking up all the tastiness!
okay, I will give them back. (exhales strongly through his nose and joey just glares at him.) look! what is so great about that sandwich?
okay, imagine the best sex you have ever had.
okay.
are you thinking about monica?
yeah.
yeah, what is that like?
ohh please do not be from a real dinosaur! please! please! please! please! please! please! please! please! (she picks up the 2 pieces and looks at the stand.) made in mexico! yes!! ugh, who would buy this?! (looks for a place to hide it and finds a wall sconce and drops the pieces into it and heads into the kitchen as the phone rings.)
(on the answering machine) rach! it is me! pick up!
hey! what is up?!
i need a few more things to make the margaritas. uhh, i need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
so all we have is ice?
see if he has ice.
okay.
oh. oh! (takes a slug of tequila.)
so where are we going next?
sur-surprise him? we are not, we are not going to make anybody mad are we?
come on man! (to gary) listen so uh, are you going to squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
yeah, no one talks like that!
oh what? like your mr. cop!
hey, I am more cop than you two!
how do you figure that?
hello! I am in the front seat, okay? I am gary's partner!
y'know, when you say partner it does not sound cop. it, it sounds gay.
umm, jealous! (he drops the cherry and it turns on.)
yeah, no problem. (tries to turn it off.)
sorry! sorry! oh, (he sticks it under his shirt) there! (it is just there flashing through his shirt) hey gary, who am i? phone home!
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors.
yeah, what is up with that serpico?
(does rachel's) nooo!
(does monica's) i know!
well thank god you were here! i mean, we have to erase that!
what?! we can not do that!
we have too! i mean what if ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? is that what you want? ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy emily? the emily that would not let him see you?
noo! oh no! no! god no! he should not get back together with her. i know that! you know that! even ross knows that! but that still does not give us the right to erase his message!
I am his sister, okay? i love him! i do not want to see him get hurt! come on! does not that give me the right to control him—help him?
i do not think he is the one who needs help.
no, look, she is obviously unstable, okay? i mean she is thinking about running out on her wedding day. (rachel slowly turns and glares at her.) (realizing what she just said.) okay, fine! but i mean, look at the position she is putting him in! what is he going to do? ross is going to run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! i mean, who would do that?! (rachel again turns and glares at her in disgust.) okay, fine, all right, but that is y'know, it is different! although it did involve a lot of the same people.
ugh!
y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she is trying to play on him.
okay, you are crazy! I am sorry, but she sounded generally upset! i mean, listen! (she hits a button on the machine.)
noooooooo!
okay, y'know, we-we are safe right? i mean nothing bad can go down!
what is it?
(deadpan) oh, hurry up. i want to sign that.
what? what? what? what is it?
is everything okay?
what is going on?
(to ross) you okay man?
uh-huh. thank joey!
uh, hello!!
hi.
all right, i guess we should go.
no, wait. wait.
oh yeah right! (she grabs the money and shoves into her pocket.)
no, monica! monica! we have to fix this!
there is nothing we can do. you erased the message!
yeah well unless we tell him.
well, if you are going to be totally rational about this, i can not argue with you! all right? fine, if you want to tell him, tell him. i just do not want to be a part of it.
oh, maybe that is emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
(on the machine) hey ross! it is you! i just want you to remember this feeling. you are lucky to be alive! so live everyday to the fullest. love yourself, okay? okay. oh, and also get stamps. bye! (he hangs up.)
wow! play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away!
right?
(excited) john glenn is here?!
pheebs, we had the most incredible night! okay, so, we are in the car…
hi!
okay, okay, so we are in the car. right? and bang! a shot was fired. and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
my god, joey!
(pouting) it was a car backfire!
yeah, but-but he did not know that!
yeah, i did not know that.
and it could have just as easily have been a bullet.
who jumps at loud noises!
wow! i could have died tonight.
yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think I will go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (he gets up and starts for the door.)
i do have a newfound respect for life.
(returning) oh my god! (storms out.)
yeah! sure! yep! (gets up) oh, y'know what? if i heard a shot right now, I would throw my body on you.
okay!
bye!
cut it out ross! i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
dude! how come you took off?
oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever…
is something wrong?
no. no I am just tired. y'know, from-from the walk.
okay.
you dove in front of ross! ross!
that is what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross!
i do not hate ross!
of course you do! i saved him! you are mad at me! it all adds up! you want ross out of the picture.
what picture?
i do not know, but i do not like what I am hearing!
look I am very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could have been a bullet and you y'know, you did not try to save me!
ohh, you are upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! i…knew…you could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help. he is not street like us!
when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that is the bottom line.
well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i was not trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross. all right? i was, i was trying to save my sandwich.
from a bullet!
i know it does not make much sense…
much sense?!
look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it!
so you risked your life, for a sandwich!
i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is (goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!
so you did not uh, choose ross before me.
no! i would never do that! you-you are like my brother!
really?!
yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (he unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for chandler) here.
thanks. (he grabs the sandwich.)
no, eh, oh-oi, easy, it is not a hot dog!
how good is that?
(with his mouthful) oh-oi-ho, yeah!
see?
hm-hmm. (goes to take another bite.)
oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
yeah. with a bite! (takes back the sandwich.) gee-e-e-eez!
hey! hi!
rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
hey! y'know what? you are in our apartment all the time! okay? this is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
y'know, it-it does not matter. the important thing is that you are here. you are my friend, and you are here. oh! (he goes over and hugs her.)
okay, just a little scared. what is going on ross?
the most amazing thing happened tonight. i thought my number was up. i had an actual near death experience!
what?! what? what happened?!
okay, okay, we were on the ride along with gary, right?
yeah!
and somebody took a shot at me!
(gasps) really?!
no, a car backfired, but (rachel suddenly calms down) i thought somebody was taking a shot at me. and rach, i…i survived! and i was filled with this-this great respect for life. y'know? i-i want to experience every moment. i want to seize every opportunity. i-i am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
because a car backfired?
(stares at her briefly) okay, why are you here?
well, i-i-i do not know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, emily called you today.
you talked to her?
no, she left a message. (he starts for the machine.) (stopping him.) but it-it kind of got erased. there is just (pause) something wrong with your machine.
well, okay, what-what did she say?
well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
wow!
now, that-that was a good thing that i told you, right?
huh? yeah! yes, of course!
okay. thank you! thank you! because—I am sorry, all right. because y'know what? she did not want me—not important. the point is, i was right. your decision. okay? i was right. (she starts for the door.) (stops) your decision.
right. i guess, i guess i should call emily.
okay, no, that is not the right decision. that is not, that is not right, no ross-ross, come on! i mean, that woman made you miserable! okay, ross, do you really want to get back into that?
okay, look, yesterday i would have even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience. i mean, that-that has got to mean something!
ugh, ross! that was not a near death experience! that was barely an experience!
you were not there! okay, maybe this is something that i-I am supposed to seize! y'know?
okay, y'know what? maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. maybe this is about escaping stuff.
huh.
i mean, look-look today you escaped (pause) (not believing it) death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?
that does make sense. because i do want to seize some opportunity, but i-i really do not want to see or talk to her.
well, there you go!
yeah. maybe today is just, close call day.
(laughing) close call day.
hey, thanks rach. (they hug.)
ohh, honey no problem. okay. (gets up.)
oh wait-wait-wait! the message is blinking. maybe you did not erase it.
oh?
(on machine) "hey ross, it is you!" (hits the stop button) oh yeah, no that is-that is an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
no. (she heads for the door again.)
(looking at the coffee table where his money was) hey umm, was-was monica here?
yeah.
yeah, i want my money back.
(going out the door) yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
hey pheebs, has gary ever been shot at for real?
yes. once. yeah, a little. he kind of did it to himself. it is not really a good story.
i wonder how i would react under fire, y'know? and not backfire but-but heavy fire, like i was in a war or something.
man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys.
before or after you were shot by your own troops?
i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
yeah, hero sandwiches. (points at ross who points back.)
well you all know that I am a pacifist so I am not interested in war in any way. (gets up) but y'know what? when the revolution comes, i will have to destroy you all. (starts to leave.) (to joey) not you joey.
hey! you guys! you are not going to believe this! i just got off the phone with my agent…
oh my god! (joey looks at her.) I am sorry, too soon. you go.
okay. i got nominated for my part on days of our lives!
joey!
good for you!
congratulations! wow! i can not believe you are nominated for an emmy!
no-no.
oh soap opera digest award!
no! I am up for a soapie!
honey? is that something you are making up?
no, no, no! it is real! and it has been since 1998. (rachel returns from the bathroom.) hey rach! rach! I am up for a soapie!
(gasps) oh my god! oh my god!! that is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
thank you! well, i guess now i know who I am taking to the awards. (points to rachel.)
oh, stop that! do not kid about that! (gasps) will all the stars be there?
many are scheduled to appear.
oh my god! oh my god! i can not go! I am going to be too nervous!
(to joey) okay, I will go!
no!! you are getting married! this is all i have.
…and it was ernst muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the velociraptor would expand it is collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it is predator. (a student raises his hand.) yes mr. lewis?
just a high pitched intimidating noise.
well we-we do not know for sure. but in my head it-it sounded something like this. (he makes a high pitched noise and alan does not know what to make of it.) of course, this is just conjecture. okay, that is uh, that is all for today. (everyone starts to get up.) uh mr. morse, can i see you for a moment?
mr. morse i need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I am afraid i-i had to fail you.
well you need 60% to pass…
seven.
no-no it is not. what-what happened there ned?
well I am sorry but, that-that is really not my problem.
well that brings me in the loop a little.
okay! (walks away from him.) umm, i uh, I am your teacher. I am sorry, you are-you are a student and i-and i like women. in spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
oh my god! that guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
really? (looks.) my god, he is really cute.
go for it.
phoebe, I am engaged!
I am just saying, get his number just in case. but no chandler is in an accident and can not perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
op, can i just tell you something? very flattered but umm, I am engaged. (points to her ring.)
well you should be embarrassed. (leaves.)
i did, but that was really fun.
(pretending to be an announcer) and the winner is…joey tribbiani! (he then gets excited and goes over to the counter to practice his acceptance speech using a bottle of maple syrup as the award.) oh… wow! i honestly never expected this. i uh, i did not prepare a speech. but umm, I would like to thank (rachel enters quietly) my parents, who have always been there for me. I would also like to thank my friends, chandler, monica, phoebe, rachel…
I am fourth! (joey is startled.) look at you with your little maple syrup award!
yeah may-maybe you do not tell anyone about this.
what? no! it is not a big deal! i do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
really?
yeah.
what award are you practicing for?
grammy, best new artist.
oh, hey listen! the soapie’s called today and i also get to present an award.
ohh that is great!
yeah!
so you will definitely get onstage, even if you do not win.
(confused) what you-you do not think I am going to win?
well of course i do! but y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category joey. i mean you are up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
yeah. no-no i-i know i might not win, but it is just…I have never even been nominated before! i want it so much.
well joey, you will probably get it. but you should probably your-your gracious loser face. y’know when like the cameras are on you and you want to look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. y’know? so it is sorta like… (does it, you will have to see it.)
hey! (likes it.)
y’know?
you practice losing the grammies too?
oh no, at the grammies i always win.
ah.
oh hey!
hey! how did your date go with jake?
oh, great! we could not keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he would kind of lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. (does that to monica.)
okay, stop it phoebe, you are getting me all tingly.
(laughs) all i could think of was y’know, "is he going to kiss me? is he going to kiss me?"
and did he?
I am a lady monica, i do not kiss and tell. but this hickey speaks for itself. (she starts to open up her blouse.)
okay-okay, i got it. i got it.
i just like him so much that i just feel like I have had 10 drinks today and I have only had six.
oh, i have not had that feeling since i first started going out with chandler. wow, I am never going to have that feeling again am i?
you sound like a guy.
no, a guy would be saying, "I am never going to get to sleep with anyone else." oh my god! I am never going to get to sleep with anyone else! I have been so busy planning the wedding that i forgot about all the things that I would be giving up! i mean, i…I am never going to have a first kiss again.
you will have a last kiss.
can i ask you something? have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
there is this kid in my class who said he is in love with me.
whoa!
(entering from her room) whoa what?
ross has a boyfriend.
i do-i do not have a boyfriend. there is a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
really?
yeah! i do not know. i mean, last year elizabeth now-now this kid. what-what-what-what is it?! am i giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? (rachel and joey both look at him.)
not right now.
it-it—the point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
oh, see now i feel bad for the kid! i had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! y’know you—i could not concentrate and i blushed every time he looked at me. i mean come on, you remember what is it is like to be 19 and in love.
yeah. i guess i can cut him some slack.
yeah.
how did you get over that teacher?
i did not. i got under him.
(to ross) problem solved.
okay bye. (they kiss.)
bye! (phoebe goes over and joins monica on the couch.) we said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
phoebe, it is okay. you do not have to tip toe around me. i-I have been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I am okay about not having that new relationship feeling…
(yelling back) i miss you too!!!! (he walks away.)
see? that is what i mean. i mean that, that is great! but i would not trade in what i have for that. i mean I am going to be with chandler for the rest of my life, and that is what makes me happy. (chandler approaches.) hey sweetie, come here! come sit down. hey phoebe and i were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. it really is do not you think?
oh totally! (holds up his finger.) pull my finger.
(to rachel) this is it! this is my category.
i know! my god! do you have your speech?
yeah, i got my speech!
do you got your gracious loser face?
yeah. (does it.)
now joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! you hug me!
okay. can i squeeze your ass?
on tv?! yeah!
‘kay!
what the?! (joey pounds the table and starts yelling at rachel, and which is drowned out by applause. rachel is desperately trying to tell joey that he is on tv right now. he finally notices and he does his gracious loser face.)
(angrily and monotone) any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. unfortunately only one can. (shakes his head in disgust.) the nominees for best supporting actress are from passions erin goff. (there is applause, which joey disgustedly waits to dye out.) from one life to live mary loren bishop (they start to applaud again, but joey interrupts in with the rest of the nominees), from all my children sarah mchann, and from days of our lives jessica ashley. and the winner is…(opens the envelope)…jessica ashley from days of our lives. (applause) uh, unfortunately jessica could not be with us tonight so I will be accepting this award on her behalf. (realizes something) and I am sure that jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. she would also like to thank my friends, chandler, monica, ross, phoebe, and rachel who is sittin’ right there! (points at rachel.) (the music starts and his microphone is turned off, this angers joey again and he disgustedly exits.)
joey! why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
rach we had to get out of there because, look what i won! (he whips out the award for best supporting actress that he accepted for jessica.)
oh my god you stole her award!
no-no! no, I am accepting it on her behalf. (he puts it up above the tv to display it.)
joey i do not think you know what behalf means.
sure i do! it is a verb! as in, "i behalfin’ it!"
joey, you have got to take this back!
but why?! i should have won one and i really want it and she did not even care enough to come to the thing! it could also be a grammy.
(looking at the award) no! joey!
come on rach! no one saw me take it! there was a whole table full of ‘them.
do you really want an award you did not win?
no! i want an award i did win! but nobody’s giving me any of those! plus—hey rach, if-if i put it up there (points to the tv) right? when people come over they will see it and they will think i won it.
joey is says best supporting actress!
i can scratch that right off.
joey no, this is wrong! you have to take it back, okay? you do not want to win an award this way. you are very talented. and someday you are going to win one of these for real and that one is going to mean something.
all right!
all right? (he sets the award down.) thank you.
I will take it back tomorrow.
thank you.
(opening his door) if i can not have it you can not have it! (rachel walks away angrily.)
(turning towards him) yes mr. lewis, how can i help you?
and why exactly would i do that? (goes back to writing on the board.)
(turning around and dragging the chalk down the board) what?!
no!
well that is different! okay? because he, he was actually in love with me!
what?
i can not believe someone would do that for a grade.
have you seen chandler?
no. why?
‘because i just keeping thinking about all these things that I am not going to have and it is freaking me out. i do not know what to do about it.
okay, do not sweat it. (looking around her.) chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. that guy’s cute. (points to a guy sitting behind monica.)
phoebe! come on I am serious! i just got to talk to him about all this.
no that is the last thing you want to do!
why?
because you are marrying him!
you got to help me out here pheebs.
all right, I have never been engaged and I have never really been married, but i can only tell you what my mother told me. whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
so I am not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I am going to spend the rest of my life with?
that is correct! yes, you are supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
your mother told you this?
yes!
the woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
oh my god! you are right! go! (monica starts to leave.) go tell chandler! hurry before it is too late! wait no! (monica stops.) does this also mean putting out does not get you love? (monica is shocked.)
i cannot believe I am going to meet jessica ashley!
okay wait-wait p-please be cool! okay? i work with this woman.
okay, I am totally cool! (she coolly knocks on the door)
hey jessica.
(coolly) hey jess.
ah, this is my friend rachel.
‘sup? (joey glares at her.)
uh listen, here is your soapie. i accepted it for ya. (hands it to her.)
well, that-that-that is it? you are going to, you are going to put it on your self or anything?
(to rachel) take it back?
absolutely.
y-y-yeah! (as they start to leave, rachel pauses and steals a vase with flowers in it.) yeah you do. (they exit.)
honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
okay. well, i think the centerpieces are too big
you are wrong! the centerpieces are fine! do you ever get scared at all?
kind of. they are really big.
does not it ever just freak you out that-that you are never going to be with anybody new again?
what?
just, i love you so much. just…it is just sometimes it bothers me that I am never going to have that feeling. y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it is new and exciting? y’know that rush?
no. no, see when i first meet somebody it is uh it is mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
okay, but all right you are a guy, does it not freak you that you are never going to sleep with anybody else?
sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I am afraid even more sweating.
even with me?
i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (monica laughs.) look, for me the rush is knowing that we are going to be together for the rest of our lives.
really?
well yeah! but now that i know that you are having these thoughts, I am back to panic, anxiety, and uh I am definitely going to need some kind of sports drink.
come here! come here! (they hug.) sweetie you do not have to worry. no, besides y’know what? I am going to have a lot of new things with you. the first time we buy a house. our first kid. our first grandkid…
(hoarsely) water! water! water!
uh mr. morse, can i speak to you for a moment?
uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? do-do you looove it? i just want you to know that I am changing your grade back.
‘because i know what you are trying to pull here. okay? it is not going to work.
y’know what? i-I am not even going to talk about this. okay? this little thing is over. i know you have a girlfriend! okay—(ned looks shocked)—yeah! and i know about the other professors! how do you think that makes me feel ned?! you used me! you do not love me and you never did! (ross turns around to make a grand exit but runs into two colleagues.) ah professor winston, professor fredrickson, I will be right with you. (to ned) do not make this worse and I will give you a c. (to the professors) shall we? (they leave.)
rach?
I will be out in a second.
oh. (picks it up.) it is just so unexpected! i…i uh…boy I will tell you it is just such an honor to be nominated for a nobel prize and y’know to win one for a massage. especially after having just won a tony award for best actress in…
(entering from her room) honey, we have to go. our reservations are at 8:00.
…in reservations at 8:00 by neil simon. (to an imaginary neil simon) thank-thank you neil. thank you for the words. (blows him a kiss.)
okay honey, you can finish this later we are going to be late. we got to go.
please, do not play the music. just uh one more. live from new york! it is saturday night!!
thank you.
hi! all right, let us go shoppin’!!
oh, okay.
wow! umm....
oh, this is so great.
all right then. (he leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) bye.
hello, people who do not live here.
i gave you a key for emergencies!
we were out of doritos.
hey, how did the date go with mr. millionaire?
mr. millionaire, new from snooty playthings! third wife sold separately.
he is great! i mean we have such a good time together! he is so funny, and sooo sweet, and I am not attracted to him at all!!
still?!
noo!! it is driving me crazy. i mean every other way he is like the perfect guy, he has everything. plus! he actually has everything.
life-sized imperial storm troopers from sharper image?
two.
wow!! can joey and i put them on and fight?
(entering, dancing and singing) oh mommie, oh daddie, i am a big old baddie! oh mommie, oh daddie, i am a big old baddie! (he dances around the dinner table and exits)
i guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
yeah, either that, or gloria estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
good. (he sets his stuff down and starts talking to kate, another cast member.) hey.
oh, so you are playing adrienne, huh?
oh, no. ah, i playing your husband, victor. I am joey tribianni.
so the ah, play’s pretty great, huh?
oh, forget about it. she rocks!
dr. drake remoray. days of our lives. voted most datable neurosurgeon by teen beat.
hey, I have done plays before. I am a serious actor.
see, i actually can pour milk, but i got you believing that i could not. now, see, that is acting.
yeah, that was real.
wow! i cannot believe mark asked you out.
i know.
what, so what are you going to tell him?
well, i told him i would think about it, but I am going to tell him no.
huh.
i mean i think I would say no to anybody right now. (hearing this gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) oh, but it was so strange. i mean I am standing there with this charming, cute guy, who is asking me to go out with him, which I am allowed to do, and i felt guilty. y'know, like I would be cheating on ross or something.
wow. so, okay, maybe that means that, you are not over ross yet and you have issues with your father.
i do not have any issues with my father.
okay, so it is probably just the ross thing then.
i hate this woman!! i hate her! she told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. okay, and whenever i can not do it, they are all like-like laughing at me.
(entering) hello.
so rachel called. wants to see me. going over in a minute.
wow, what-what do you think she wants?
well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
it is possible. you are very loveable, I would miss you if i broke up with you. (ross glares at him) i was just trying to be supportive.
then be supportive like a guy.
(in a deep voice) if i broke up with you, I would miss you.
hi.
hi!
you ah, wanted to see me?
yeah. ahh, here is a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)
what?!
oh, y'know, it is just like hats, and a shirt, and cd’s, just sort of stuff that you have left here.
what are you doing? are you trying to hurt me? or something?
no. ross, it, it just seems that y'know it is time we-we y'know, move on. i mean, i mean do not’ you think?
yes.
yeah?
yes, i do.
good.
yeah, i-i really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) hey! this-this was a gift?!
ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
it is still a gift! i got it from the gift shop!
okay, all right, give me the mug! I will keep the mug.
no!! y'know-y'know do not do me any favours. in fact, where, where is the rest of my stuff?! huh? like-like my umm, (picks up a book) hey, this book is mine!! and-and-and, and that t-shirt you sleep in? I would like that back too. yes, i do.
you know how much i love that t-shirt! you never even where that t-shirt!
I am just trying to help you, move on.
oh, you are a petty man. you are a petty, petty....
petty...
petty... (goes into her room)
petty...
petty...
petty...
small...
small... (rachel comes back into the living room and catches ross mocking her.)
you are so just doing this out of spite.
awwwahuh, no, no, no!!
huh?
I am-I am going to wear this all the time! i love this shirt!! (he kisses the shirt)
you have not worn that t-shirt since you were 15!! it does not even fit you anymore!
oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
(imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!
oh-oh, okay, okay! (he quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on the t-shirt. it is an old ‘frankie says relax’ t-shirt, that barely fits him. rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) if you do not mind I am going to the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (starts to leave) you have a pleasant evening. (he exits and leaves the door open.)
so, you are like a zillionaire? (pete smiles and nods)
and you are our age. you are our age.
y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
yeah, or, or, or, mississ-pete.
oh, oh, i got it! pete-chicago.
that is not a state joe.
oh, and mississ-pete is?
you are our age!
absolutely! (he goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head and says...) now get out of here you!! (pete leaves) (to the gang) okay, I am running out of places i can touch him! look, is there something wrong with me? i mean why am i only attracted to guys where there is no future? either they are too old, or they are too young, and then there is pete who is-who is crazy about me, and who is absolutely perfect for me, and there is like zip going on! i mean, seriously, does it sound like something is wrong with me?!
yeah, kind of.
well, why do not you tell me what you are supposed to be! huh? because i sure as hell can not figure it out! i talk to you and nothing. you look at me, and it is nothing. (he kisses her) nothing.
yeah.
oh, hey, how about this one. ah, it is says so in the script! y'know ah, i-i do not know why my character likes you either, i mean it says in the script here that you are a bitch.
it does in mine!
i can blow dry it. i can put gel on it. it does not matter, i still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. it is so annoying. does it bug you?
you bug me.
is there any chance you did not see that?
ross! you got to stop! okay?! you can not just stare through the peep hole for three hours! you are going to get peep eye!
i knew it! i knew it! i always knew she liked him! y'know, she would say no, but here we are! right? we just broke up, first thing she does!
you did not just break up.
hey, it is been like three weeks!
you slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. i mean bullets have left guns slower!
here they come, here they come. oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I am going to kill myself, i swear. i can not, i can not watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) come on, date over! date over! uh-oh, here we go, she is going in.
okay.
she is going in. wait! he is going in! he is going in!! the door’s closed! i, i can not see anything but the door closed!!
and the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
okay, i have to do something. i mean, i have, i have to stop it!
stop what?!
i do not know, but i ah, i have the feeling that my being there will do it. I will go over and i will borrow something. juice!! i need juice!!
no!! you can not!!
look, they must be stopped!
i am your friend, and i am not going to let you do this!! (ross is now dragging chandler and the foosball table to the door) you are surprisingly strong!
i need juice! people need juice!!
look man!
people need juice!
listen to me!! (chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
juice, i need...
she is moving on! okay, if it is not this guy, it is going to be somebody else! and unless you are thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! okay, man? it is over.
yeah, okay.
okay.
it is just i miss her so much.
i know. (he rubs ross’s head)
oh. that is so monica can keep track. that way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘where is number 27?!’
y'know what?
i can not do this.
well, oh, mark, I am doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I am just doing it to get back at ross. I am sorry, it is not very fair to you.
oh god. I am sorry about this.
you sure?
sure.
(looks around) well, with all these doctors and nurses, I am going to say, midget rodeo.
okay. umm, y'know, i do not think, i do not think i told you this, but umm, i just got out of a really serious relationship.
so i did tell you. okay, y'know, that really is not the thing. umm, the thing is that, right now I am just in a place in my life where i need to focus on me. y'know what i mean?
i so want to be attracted to you.
I am sorry.
it is not?
well, um, look i-i do not want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy i just told i was not attracted too.
i do not think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (he blows on his hand) draw!! (he quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a western.)
(to joey) i was not doing anything. (joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) uh-oh, what did she do now?
just because she went to yale drama, she thinks she is like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
ah, sliced bread, a wonderful lady macbeth.
god, i just, i hate her! i hate her!! with her, ‘oh, I am so talented.’ and ‘oh, I am so pretty,’ and ‘ooh, i smell so good.’
i think somebody has a crush on somebody.
hey, chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! y'know?
I am talking about you. you big, big freak.
oh. (realises) ohh. ohh, you are out of your mind.
hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! if you were in a school yard you would be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
oh, yeah?! then how come i keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
well, why do not you tell me what you are supposed to be! huh? because i sure as hell can not figure it out! i talk to you and it is nothing. you look at me, and nothing. (he kisses her, more passionately this time) nothing.
better?
ah, kate?
you ah, you forgot your shoes.
hey, listen you ah....
...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
(to chandler) hey! (chandler looks up, startled) why is not it spiderman? y’know like goldman, silverman...
‘because it is-it is not his last name.
it is not?
no, it is not like, like phil spiderman. he is a spider, man. y'know like ah, like goldman is a last name, but there is no gold man.
oh, okay. there should be gold man!
(entering) hey!
hey, rach, how was work?
oh, great. although i did sit down where there was not a chair.
by the way, ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
oh, well, i guess i had that one coming. I am just going to throw it out, it is probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)
something wrong?
(she takes the t-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) no. nothing. (she smiles and goes into her room.)
so, ahh, what kind of powers would gold man have?
okay well, he would turn things to gold.
what about things that are already gold?
ahh, his work is done.
okay, let us play my game now.
okay. all right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-draw!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)
pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for monica? i can not figure this out! it is so hard! should i get her a (turning to each page) tiffany cut or a princess cut or a—ah-ah! paper cut!
now, have you told anyone else?
no, i do not want to tell anybody else because i do not want monica to find out.
you told me.
well, it is because i trust you, you are one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when i was looking at ring brochures.
yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. i only wish you had not been on the toilet.
me too.
hey. (heads straight for the fridge.)
hey.
hey! so chandler, want to go to the coffeehouse?
oh all right.
yeah, coffeehouse.
oh perfect, we were just going to see if you wanted to go.
oh well, we do not because we got…the…other pl-place.
how rude.
oh, I am sorry. you want to bite? (holds his piece out for him.)
so how are things going with paul?
good. although y’know, he-he is a private guy. y’know, i wish i could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
that is easy! you just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that will not open.
so what are you saying; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
no that is what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
hi!
(to rachel) watch this.
(to phoebe) okay.
hi paul!
so how are things going with you?
okay. (gets up and starts to leave with paul.)
hi!
great to see you!
how you doing?
okay! you take care!
hey pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and chandler blowing us off before?
yeah! that was so weird, huh?
phoebe, why did you do it?
i did not do it! it was chandler! he is… he is mad at you!
what?! why?!
please, i think you know why.
i can not think of anything.
come on ross, you are a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
wait a minute, is it because joey and i did not invite him to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
do you think that is something that he would be mad at you for?
i guess it could.
well then i think that is it.
well, if he is angry, he really should not just cover it up. i-i wish he would just tell me the truth.
oh, if that is what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
yeah that is great. but first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. tell me about your day.
okay. hey, what are you thinking? what are you thinking right now?
yeah that is great paul, but y’know i want to know what—(puts her hands on his shoulders)—wow, those are really great! i just want to know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. y’know they say that still waters run deep and i want to swim in yours.
no paul, i do not know anything about you! y’know, like-like your childhood! tell me about your childhood!
okay, well then how about puberty! come on, that is always a painful time! y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you are sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
well, you are lucky you never met that bitch sharon majesky. anyway, umm… the rest of you life, y’know? any regrets?
all right paul, I am not asking for a lot here. okay? just give me something. anything!
okay.
all right.
hm-mmm.
that is-that is great! see? i already feel like i know you a little better! thank you. okay, come on. now we can go eat. let us go. (gets up to leave, but paul does not move.)
oh!
yeah. yeah, i-i-i see the scare. listen, paul, i think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. it is really, it is beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
what?! wait! what are you talking about?! you love their kung pao chicken!
my god, I am sorry! I am sorry! i did not mean to do that! i would not do that!
nothin! this is the nine millionth ring store we have been too and i can not find the perfect ring! (goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) ugly ring! ugly ring! ugly ring! (notices that one of the jewelers is watching him.) it is a beautiful selection. (the jeweler walks away slowly.)
okay, so maybe you do not get her a ring. maybe you-maybe you do something different. y’know? maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? or an engagement tiara? or—ooh! an engagement revolutionary war musket! (picks one up from the display in the corner.
y’know, I am so glad i picked you to help me with this.
huh? can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
yeah, I am going to stick with the ring. (goes to another display counter.) oh, this one’s nice! (pointing to another ring.) i like this one! sir? uh, kind sir? can i see this one?
(coming over after returning the musket) wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. okay? i know how to haggle. so let me handle this from here on out.
uh-uh, yes. i would like to see that ring please.
or not, whatever.
sir, can i ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
(choking up) oh my god that is it, that is the ring! how much is it?
chandler, i-i will handle this! (to the jeweler) how much is it?
we will give you $10.
yes! yes, but i can only pay $8,000.
we stand firm at $10.
uh, credit card. (reaches for it then realizes) oh no! no-no, but i left my credit card with joey. (to phoebe) okay, I will go get it. you guard the ring.
okay. (to the jeweler) listen, I am sorry about before. do you have anything her for $10.
I will give you $1 for them.
hey, remember how chandler and phoebe blew us off yesterday?
no.
remember? you-you were eating pizza.
yeah.
okay. well, apparently chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
oh, we are supposed to just get him a ticket?! that guy is always mooching off of us!
yeah! anyway, i-i still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another knicks game and invite him.
oh wow that is a great idea! and i still have his credit card.
oh. (starts to get his money)
hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, i got this one. here you go. (hands gunther chandler’s card.) y’know i got to tell ya, sometimes i just—i do not get chandler. y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you do not get all upset.
all the time?
all the time!
oh my god! oh my god!!
still crying?
like a little girl. i know. i know. i know. this is all my fault; i wanted him to open up. but god, i did not know that i was going to unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
y’know, i only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. and one of them is sex.
what is the other one?
i do not know, I have never had to use the other one. I am just saying y’know, if we are having sex, he is not going to be talking.
oh that is right. you are the talker. (they both reflect on that briefly) anyway uh, great idea! umm, i got to go to the store; i told him that i would buy him some more tissues.
oh, we have some…
no you do not!
okay umm, I would also like to try on the tiara. (the male jeweler hands it to her.) oh yeah. okay. (puts it on.) (to the jeweler) what do you think, too much?
okay. then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. (he hands it to her and phoebe poses in front of one of those small mirrors.) something is missing. it is not… okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
oh my god!! (she runs after him, but sets of the security system, which locks the store’s door and brings down a set of bars behind her, caging her in.) no! what?! help me! let me out! now! (points the musket at them.)
no. how are ya paul? (starts to look for his credit card.)
no, did he hug you?!
well, you can see my dad in vegas kissing other dads.
yeah?
I am a little busy here paul.
okay, a quick one. come on hug it out. (paul rushes over and hugs chandler tightly.) oh hey! there you go. (the hug continues.) okay. (the hug continues.)
okay! (pushes him away.)
(entering) hey!
whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (motions to chandler, "what is going on?") hi, paul is it? (paul nods yes and still hugging joey.)
do you have my credit card?
yes, it is in my… in…in my pocket. (paul has not dropped him yet.) (chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) my back pocket! my back pocket!
thank god! (grabs his card.)
oh hey listen i got us tickets to a knicks game tonight.
oh, i can not go.
come on! it will be fun! me, you, and ross, and… paul probably…
chandler, i found the perfect ring. (holding it out for her.)
oh, that is uh, that is pretty nice but I am going to go with the one i picked first.
oh my god chandler, the one you picked is gone. it is over!
what?
some guy bought it. I am sorry. i tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!
they put you in jail?
the little jail between the doors!
phoebe, i asked you to guard the ring!
i know, I am sorry! but y’know, this ring is better! monica never even saw the other ring.
yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring i got goose bumps.
maybe it was the guy.
it was the ring!
hey! so uh, was he excited about the tickets?
no! he blew us off!
what?!
i know!
i can not believe it. (pause) can i tell you something? I am a little mad at him now.
can i tell you something? me too.
y’know what? he did not want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we do not talk to him at all!
ooooh! freeze him out.
that is right!
i like it!
eh? we will show him!
from now on, it is going to be joey and ross, best friends. (they shake hands.) okay! we are going to be the new joey and chandler.
hi. I am back.
ah that is great. no actually that is… (in a sexy voice) that is great! that is really great! y’know, i got to tell ya writing, i mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kind of hot.
a lover?
oh yeah surfer?
okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, (sits on the counter and buttons her sweater to show some cleavage) get a little more comfortable here. wait, now wait a second, this is not too revealing is it?
i do not care about the little dude! i can not! i cannot listen to anymore of this! y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! and then it is only because they get paid $100 an hour! do you know how much money i could have made listening to you? $2,000! and do you know when i figured that out? while you were talking!
oh… I am sorry. i… i-i do not mean—i did not mean to stifle you. i… this is all just a little overwhelming.
I am so glad, I am so glad you shared. (feeling his shoulder.) and I am glad that you are done. what do you say we umm… (nods in the direction of the bedroom.)
(entering from her room) hey.
i can not believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
it is not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! it is a beautiful ring!
no, it is not! when i looked at the other ring i could see monica’s face when i gave it to her, y’know? and i could see her saying yes. when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring! unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye. (does so and laughs.) look, this is the most important thing I am going to do in my life. i want to make sure it is perfect.
okay. there may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘because i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
i can not do that.
well you certainly can not give her that stupid gumball ring.
there he is! (points.)
okay and he has not proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
wow! you are good! after this, we should solve crimes.
yeah! okay, go, go, go get him.
oh, okay. (walks over to him.) excuse me sir? could you come with me please? you have a phone call.
it is your office.
john?
(to chandler) here he is.
(to him) hi! hi. okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you are about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. so, I am going to need to have that back. (the guy is not sure.) but, in exchange I am willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (looking at the ring.) ew.
wow! i would trade.
no-no! this is my fiancee (phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. you do not want to break her heart now do you?
yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?
yeah, she is dying… of a cough apparently.
yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. see, if I am not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…
(interrupting her) okay, that is enough honey!
great! okay, here. (holds the ring up for him.)
thank you. thank you. thank you! (to his girlfriend) and you are about to marry a wonderful man! (she stunned and he is horrified.) hey! I am marrying a dead woman!
guys? (they ignore him.) I have got something important to tell ya. (still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the tv.) guys? (they lean over to try and watch the tv, chandler mimics them.) guys?! (pause) I am going to ask monica to marry me.
(to ross) i think we got to end the freeze out.
wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
yeah, check out the ring. (shows it to them.)
oh my god!!
so you two are really serious?!
yep, pretty much.
you-you are going to get married?! i mean… we are going to be brothers-in-law! (they hug.)
and-and-and-and-and-and, and we are going to be friends again!
(goes to hug him and stops short) heyyyy—what?
oh it is water under the bridge, forget it!
okay! (they hug.) i was going to wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? but i got so excited i just had to tell you guys because you are my best friends.
i think I am going to cry!
(who has just entered) ugh! no more crying! please! i just dumped one cry baby, I will dump you too!
I am going to ask monica to marry me.
oh my god! oh my god! oh chandler!! (hugs him.) you guys are going to be so happy!
i know.
(holding an empty tissue box) where is all the tissues?! (throws the box down in disgust.)
check out the ring.
(gasps) nice! one and a half carat easy.
(entering) hi.
hey-hey pheebs!
what?
chandler’s going to ask monica to marry him!
oh i know, i helped pick out the ring.
you told her before you told us?
well, she walked in when i was looking at the ring brochures. you can understand that, right? (ross and joey look at each other and go back to watching the game on tv.) guys? guys? (walks in front of them again.)
hey, you are not going to believe this. i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy. they printed it!
i did not know playboy prints jokes.
yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. it is not just about the pictures.
that did not work on mom, it is not going to work on us.
(showing them the page) here, check it out. it is the first one, too.
that is funny. it was also funny when i made it up.
what?
i made that joke up.
uh, oh-oh, no you did not. i did.
yes, i did. i told it to dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he would ever heard.
hey, tell dan, ‘thanks.’
what?
I am sorry, i was just reading the joke below it. man, that one is funny. (ross grabs the magazine away from her.)
monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
no.
seriously?
well, you tell a lot of jokes!
look, chandler, it is my joke. but, hey, if it makes you feel any better they do not print the name, so it does not really matter who gets credit, right?
yeah, i guess.
(entering) hey guys.
(jumping up from his chair) hey, joey, playboy printed my joke.
no, it is my joke, it is mine. you can call them, they will tell you.
it is my joke.
it is my joke.
whoa-whoa-whoa. jokes? you guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
dude, you have got to turn on behind the music. the band heart is having a really tough time, and i think they may break up.
let us go watch it at your place.
nah, monica’s watching some cooking show. come on, i do not want to miss when they were skinny.
chandler, chandler, y’know what we should do? you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses.
what? no, i want to watch this. (he turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). did your cable go out?
no, that is vh-1. i got to tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . it is like a lotta noise to me. i do not know…
joey, why is your cable out?
i uh, oh! because, uh, i have not really paid the bill
if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
no, chandler. look, forget about it, okay? look, i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out. oh, was she hot.
whoa ho.
i know! yeah, but, look i can handle it. all right? look, i can listen to the radio, huh? and ross gave me this great book (holds up the playboy magazine).
(picks up the phone) all right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
sure.
(with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) paid your phone bill?
not so much.
(entering) hey.
(relieved) it is only you.
wh-wh-what are you doing?
we are looking at a playboy.
oh, i want to look too! (she runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). yikes!
so do you think that these pictures—are, are they trying to tell a story?
oh, yeah, sure. i mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she is crying out, ‘where are they, where are they?’
well, she is not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
oh, yeah. aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
you see, now, i would date this girl. she is cute, she is outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. i mean, that is got to come in handy
okay, I have got a question. if you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
(thinks) i do not know.
me neither.
rachel.
what?!
i do not know. (pause) me neither.
you forget how many great songs heart had.
yeah.
you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard.
so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
oh, you guys, with this joke. i got to say, i know i cracked up, but I am not even sure i got it.
what, you did not get it? the doctor is a monkey.
and monkeys can not write out prescriptions.
(stops laughing, to ross) you are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
your joke? well, i think ‘the hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think I will show the sexy teller that i am a published writer.
well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
yeah!
well, I am not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).
okay (he goes to sit down).
ah, gunther, i can not pay for this right now because I am not working, so I have had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.
uh, i do not know. ya see, it is just, see i was a regular on a soap opera y’know? and to go from that to this, i just… plus, I would have to wait on all my friends.
what?!
maybe i could be a waiter. could i use the phone?
(visibly upset) she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel.
(visibly upset) he took my joke, he took it.
it is wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel.
you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what? I am going to get a joke journal. y’know? and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
that is a good idea.
yeah!
do you know what is a bad idea?
picking rachel.
that is right. (a noise comes from the living room.) did you hear something?
maybe it is the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
it is coming from the living room.
(sheepishly) i finished my book. (chandler and monica slowly retreat back to bed.)
(entering) hey, you guys.
(laughing) oh, do not you guys look cute. you guys make such a cute couple.
monica, what are you doing?
(laughing harder) nothing, I am just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (to phoebe) remember, when you picked rachel over me? that was funny.
i guess it was kind of funny.
(angrily) it was not funny at all! why would you do that? why did not you pick me?
fine. the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that you are … just … kind of high maintenance—okay let us go to lunch!
that is completely untrue. you think I am high maintenance? okay, prove it. i want you to make a list and we are going to go through it point by point!
no, okay, you are right. you are easy-going. you are just not as easy-going as rachel. she is just more flexible and-and mellow. that is all.
(to monica) well, people are different.
ya, you know, rachel … she will do whatever you want. y’know, you can just walk all over her.
what? wait a minute. what are you saying, that I am a pushover? I am not a pushover.
oh, okay, (laughing) you are not a pushover.
oh my … you think I am a pushover. well wait, watch this, you know what? you are not invited to lunch. what do you think of that? i think that is pretty strong, that is what i think. come on, monica, let us go to lunch. (she leaves)
(to phoebe) you start working on that list. (she grabs her coat and leaves, too.)
i cannot believe her.
i know. where do you want to go eat?
oh, oh, i love that japanese place.
I am sick of japanese. we are not going there.
all right, wherever you want to go is cool.
all right.
(showing the playboy magazine to gunther) oh, hey, gunther, check this out.
hey ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘because I am heading up there.
uh, yeah, I will take a coffee. thanks, man.
sure. (to monica and rachel) coffee? ‘because I am going up there.
no.
no, thank you.
(to a table of strangers) you guys need anything, ‘because I am heading up there.
you got it.
joey, what are you doing?
just being friendly. (he gives monica a ‘what is wrong with you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)
joey, honey, i do not think you are supposed to go back there.
nah, it is okay. right, gunther? (winks at him as if they are in on a secret together.)
okay, but i do not see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
joey, do you work here?
no.
yeah?
joey, what is going on. what did not you tell us you work here?
it is kind of embarrassing, y’know. i mean, i was an actor and now I am a waiter. it is supposed to go in the other direction.
so is your apron. you are wearing it like a cape.
i mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? i guess I am going to be hanging out here anyway. i might as well get paid for it, right? i just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
come on, joey, i did it and it was fine.
yeah, why would it be weird? hey, joey, can i get some coffee?
okay, i guess it does not seem that weird.
seriously, i-i asked you before and you still have not gotten it.
see, now it is weird again.
i think it is great that you work here. you are going to make a lot of money, and here is your first tip: do not eat yellow snow. (he laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at ross, and writes in his journal). ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
well, you know what? this is great. finally, i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too. let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse. first of all, the customer is always right. (joey nods.) a smile goes a long way. (joey smiles) and if anyone is ever rude to you? sneeze muffin.
thanks, rach. look, you guys are just terrific. y’know? now, how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers. it is all about turnover.
joey, seriously, can i get my coffee?
oh, I am sorry, ross. I will get it for you right now. and since i made you wait, I will toss in a free muffin.
phoebe. we would like to talk to you for a second.
okay.
so, maybe i am a little high maintenance. and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover. but you know what we decided you are?
yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, phoebe, are flaky.
hah!
that true, i am flaky.
so, what, you are just, you are just okay with being flaky?
yeah, totally.
well, then, I am okay with being high maintenance.
yeah, and i am okay with being a pushover.
that is great. good for you guys.
i am not high maintenance!
i am not a pushover!
who said you were?
oh, I am flaky. I will say anything.
hey, gunther. can you uh, can you cover for me? i just got an audition.
really?! i like your natural color. come on man, it is a great part. look, check it out. I am the lead guy’s best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat. listen-listen. ‘I am sorry, that seat’s saved.’
okay, maybe he is not his best friend, but …
oh, man, i could totally get that part. ‘I am sorry, that seat is taken.’
no, no, i did not mean you. but, you believed me, huh?
so, you would hire me, right?
exactly! all right, everybody, listen up. the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
yeah, it is for the kids. to keep the kids off drugs. it is a very important issue in this month’s playboy. I am sure you all read about it.
it is my joke.
it is my joke.
y’know, i do not think we are going to settle this.
let us have monica decide.
yeah!
yeah!
hey mon.
mon, get out here!
monica! (she appears, not sure why she was summoned.)
okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is.
why do i have to decide?
because you are the only one that can be fair.
yeah.
i can not be fair. you are my boyfriend.
yeah, but I am your brother. we are family. that is the most important thing in the world.
(to ross) do not try to sway her. (to monica) (softly) I am your only chance to have a baby. okay, let us go.
we will each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.
okay, chandler, you go first.
okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.
oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas?
can i finish my story?!
do you want me to pick you?!
see, i would never snap at you like that.
continue.
so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steve’s doctor’s name is doctor muppy. so i said, ‘doctor monkey?’ and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up. (he slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)
are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution? monkey into man? plus, I am a doctor, and i had a monkey. I am doctor monkey!
I am not arguing with that.
all right, I have heard enough. I have made my decision.
you are both idiots. the joke is not funny, and it is offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! you should not be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! now let it go! the joke sucks!
it is your joke.
is not.
hi, chandler. there you are.
hi, oh hi.
hey, it is phoebe and rachel. um, why do not you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (pause.) being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(he falters and monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.
wow, you know what? that is the best fake speech i think I have ever heard.
really? I have heard better.
wait, wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler.
(to chandler) I am out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?
look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler!
(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) you are a little high maintenance.
ahhh! you are on my list.
I am sorry. you are not easy-going, but you are passionate, and that is good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that I am pretty good about making you feel better about that. and that is good too. so, they can say that you are high maintenance, but it is okay, because i like … maintaining you.
(embarrassed) (to phoebe and rachel) i did not even tell him to say that. (they hug). all right you are off my list.
(happily) I am off the list. (sits on the couch.)
(sits next to him) phoebe, it is okay that you do not want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend.
(to monica) y’know, suddenly i find you very attractive.
hey, buddy boy, how did the audition go?
not good, no. i did not get the part, and i lost my job here, so …
wow! that is a bad audition.
how-how did you lose your job here?
well, i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. so, i went anyway, and then he fired me.
he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you have been working here two days? that is not, that is not right.
yeah, what are ya going to do?
joey, you can not let him get away with that. ya know what, I am not going to let him get away with that. I am going to say something to him—no, i really should not say anything—no, i should say something to him. (goes to the counter) gunther, i want you to give joey his job back. that is really not fair that you have to fire him…
what?
that is right, he can have his job back. I am glad we got that all straightened out. there you go, joey, you got your job back.
that is great. thanks rach.
yeah, pretty nice, huh? now who is a pushover?
(returning from the bathroom) rach, you are in my seat.
oh, I am sorry. (gets up and moves.)
hey, i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
i pick you, phoebe.
oh, yeah. definitely you, pheebs.
yeah, well, i kind of thought.
hey.
hey. oh, i have a question. if-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
no way.
I am not answering that.
joey! (pause as they all stare at him.) no way. I am not answering that.
hi
how was the honeymoon?
oh!
so, where is mike?
oh, he is at the doctor, he did not poop the whole time we were there!
well anyway, I am glad you are back, i really need your help.
oh, why? what is up?
i have an audition for this play and for some of it i have to speak french. which, according to my résumé, I am fluent in.
joey, you should not lie on your résumé.
yeah, you really should not. (to ross, sarcastically) by the way, how was that year-long dig in cairo?
(whispering) it was ok...
i did not know you spoke french.
oui, bien sur je parle français! qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
oh... you are so sexy!
well, so, will you help me? i really want to be in this play.
sure! tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
seriously stop it, or I am going to jump on ya.
hey.
hey.
why are you wearing my apron?
I am making cookies for erica. and oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if i introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who is carrying my child"? (she is not amused) no? divorce?
(he enters) hey.
hey.
you guys know where rachel is?
no, we have not seen her since this morning.
so unbelievable. she was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with emma. (he tries to take a cookie but monica slaps his hand)
hey!
hey!
these are for erica!
what? she is going to eat all those cookies?
well, i want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
so, why is erica coming to visit?
well, because we want to get to know her better and she is never been to new york so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, statue of liberty, empire state building...
oh, those places! there is always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there is always some idiot who goes "mooooo"!
well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
(looking at rachel entering with emma) oh, hi! hi! thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
ross...
no, no, no, I am sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at barney's?
my father had an heart attack... (crying) ...while i was at barney’s.
oh my god.
honey.
I am so sorry...
is-is he ok?
yeah, they said he is going to be fine, but he is still heavily sedated.
ok, ok. I am going to come out to long island with you, i mean, you can not be alone right now.
no, come on, I am totally ok. (hugging him) i do not need you to come! i can totally handle this on my own.
still-still, let me come... for me.
ok. if you really need to.
i bet someone could use one of monica's freshly baked cookies.
oh, i really could.
oh!
ohh... (ross mouths ha-ha at monica and takes two cookies and she looks at him angrily)
all right, it seems pretty simple. your first line is "my name is claude", so, just repeat after me. "je m'appelle claude".
je de coup clow.
well, just... let us try it again.
ok.
je m'appelle claude.
je depli mblue.
uh. it is not... quite what I am saying.
really? it sounds exactly the same to me.
it does, really?
yeah.
all right, let just try it again. really listen.
got it.
(slowly) je m'appelle claude.
je te flouppe fli.
oh, mon dieu!
oh, de fuff!
(entering with erica and chandler) hey you guys.
hi!
hey.
i want you to meet someone really special. phoebe, this is erica. and this is the baby!
oh!
joey. erica, baby!
hi.
everyone. erica, baby!
monica. calm, self.
welcome to new york city! or should i say "ghe deu flooff new york city"?
why would you say that?
ok. what are you going to be doing today?
oh, you know what you should do? you should walk all the way at the top of statue of liberty.
great! (to monica) this baby'd better to be really good.
(stopping a nurse who is coming out of a room) oh, uhm, excuse me, I am here to see my father. my name is rachel green.
and I am doctor ross geller.
ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? that actually means something here.
can somebody please go in?
rach, i think I am going to wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, i do not want to infect him.
ross, please, do not be so scared of him!
I am not scared of him, I am really sick!
I am feeling better.
oh! (they enter. rachel sees his father, lying on a bed, with tubes, drip and everything) oh! oh my god! ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer i got him was just money down the drain, huh?
oh, great, are you going to be ok?
he is unconscious, i think we will be just fine!
did the tv wake you?
ouchy.
well, i came with rachel, who should be back any second! (pause) so what is new?
right, is it painful?
nope, just the one. rach!
je m'appelle claude.
je do call blue!
noooo! ok, maybe if we just break it down. ok, let us try at one syllable at a time. ok? so repeat after me. "je".
je.
m'ap
mah
pelle
pel.
great, ok faster! "je"
je.
m'ap
mah
pelle
pel.
je m'appelle!
me pooh pooh!
ok, it is too hard, i can not teach you!
what are you doing?
i, i have to go before i put your head through a wall. (she leaves)
(he goes out calling her) do not move! do not go! i need you! my audition is tomorrow! shah blue blah! me lah peeh! ombrah! (he gives up). pooh.
hey!
hi!
i was going to make us some dinner but all i found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. (pause) i think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
uh. (pause) did you call your parents?
oh, yeah. emma's doing great.
oh good.
wow.
what?
just can not believe I am in rachel green's room.
what do you mean? you have been in my room before!
yeah, sure, right! like I have ever been in rachel green's room.
ok i got to tell ya, it is really weird when you use my whole name.
sorry. (rachel sits on her bed). you ok?
yeah.
you had a rough day, uh?
yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? i mean he is a doctor, you do not expect doctors to get sick!
but we do! (pause) it is going to be ok, rach!
(she is sad) ow. i do not want him to wake up alone! i should go to the hospital!
what? no, no! hey, hey, hey look...
what?
they gave him a lot of medication, ok? he would not even know if you were there. look, we will go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
really, i should not feel guilty?
no, god! hey, rach, you have been an amazing daughter, ok? right now you just need to get some rest.
ok, maybe you are right.
(he kisses her on her forehead) good night.
wait, wait, wait, wait. would you stay here with me for a little while?
sure!
ok. (she sits on the bed and ross sits near her) thank you for coming with me today.
oh, of course...
rachel green is very happy you are in her room!
me too. come here. (they hug)
i just do not want to be alone tonight.
ok, well, uh, i can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(there is one of those moments. they are staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). no, rach! I am sorry, i just do not think this, this, this is a good idea.
wait, we will not know that until we do it, will we?
no, look, uh. you are upset about your father and you are feeling vulnerable and i just do not feel it would be right, I would feel like I would be, you know, taking advantage of you.
taking advantage? I am giving you the advantage, enjoy!
look, I am sure it would be great, but i-i think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I am going to go!
wow. ok.
I will see you in the morning (he leaves).
mhm-mh!
(outside her room, talking by himself) have not had sex in four months, i should get a medal for that!
oh, I am glad. listen, i want to apologize about chandler, though. i just did not see this coming.
(enters the room wearing an "i love new york" t-shirt, a "statue of liberty" hat and carrying bags) new york is awesome!
what is with you?
yeah, I have been to these places before, but I have never really seen them, you know.
yeah, you miss alot, when you are moo-ing.
oh! it was our pleasure. we are so much enjoying getting to know you.
oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
that is great.
how is that now?
so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too?
was he falsely accused of something? (they look hopeful)
I will bet his dad does not think so.
are you awake?
of course I am awake. assume from now on that I am always awake! (he turns the light on)
alright, we do not know that it is him. i mean, it could be the football guy.
honey, it is us. of course it is the shovel-killer.
alright, let us say that it is him, would we not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently?
I would keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is.
how?
i dunno, are not there tests for these things, right?
yeah, but maybe we are just over-reacting.
pff, easy for you to say, he is a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he is probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
thank you.
hey joey.
hey!
listen, i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and, and i know, i was too impatient. so let us try it again.
oh, no, that is okay, i do not need your help. i worked on it myself and i got to say, i am pretty good!
really, can i hear some of it.
sure, sure. ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. he starts talking in a fake french accent, making gestures with his hands) "bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" (phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, joey seems very proud though) see?
well, you are not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) you are not... you are not... again, you are not speaking french!
(offended) oh well i think i am, yeah and i think I am definitely going to get the part.
how could you possibly think that?
for one thing, the guy on the tape said i was doing a good job!
hey rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
(she turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) sure. (she gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)
you have been quiet all morning. is everything okay?
hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at ross)
you sure you are alright?
(coldly) yep.
(knowing she is not alright) of-kay. well, I am going to go grab us some breakfast. (he starts to leave)
fyi..
(knew this was coming) there it is... (he comes back)
in the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)
(half amused) wait, wait, (looks around a little) you are mad at me about last night? i was just trying to do the right thing.
(sarcastically) really? well, it seems to me if you would done the right thing, i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
(acknowledging the last part of her sentence) well...
oh stop that!
i can not believe this. i was just being a good guy. i treated you with respect and understanding.
(sarcastic) oh, that is so hot. she walks around him to the other side)
hey, i was looking out for you.
oh, really, well ross, you know what? i am a big girl. i do not need someone telling me what is best for me.
i got to say, i have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
oh, really, really? well, it was not very good for me either. (she turns to leave and ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)
hey you know what? you know what? to avoid this little thing in the future, let us just say, you and me, never having sex again.
what?
that is right, sex is off the table. (the door starts to open behind him and dr. green emerges) i am never having sex with you again. (rachel stays quiet and after a few moments ross realizes what has happened. he turns abruptly) dr. green, are you feeling better? (rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)
hey! how was lunch?
(struggling) oh, really?
of-okay. (steps closer to monica and speaks softly) so, is she going to take the test?
nope, she does not have to, i found out who the father is.
oh god. it is shovely-joe, is not it?
(smiling) no it is not.
how do you know?
oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
the thing we never do.
(nods in appreciation) shovely joe!
right. (clears his throat) dja bu bu claude. uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
dude, come on! french it you-up!
toutes la smore! bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! pfoof!
(in a french accent) uh, excuse me. uh, i am reginé philange. i was passing by when i heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my french town of estée lauder.
sa-sa-saw!
écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. c'est mon petit frère. il est un peu retardé. (translation: listen, i will tell you the truth. he is my little bother. he is a bit retarded.)
alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (translation: so, would you please just humor him?)
ah. all right. but my french was good?
(to phoebe) oh-hoh! ha-hah! see!
(to the director) merci. au revoir. (translation: thanks, goodbye.)
yeah-hah. toute-de-le-fruit.
emma's down for the night.
oh, good.
so uh... i guess i want to take off.
okay... hey listen, just before you go i-i again, i just want to say "thank you" for coming with me.
oh, no problem.
and also, you know i uh, i was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it is probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
thank you. I am glad you agree.
it is a shame though, i mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
yeah... yeah, that is true.
hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
oh, ye-ah!
you know it was you are uhm... birthday...
...valentine's day...
well, i guess that is all in the past, now.
hmmm-mmmm.
(after a pause) not even one more time?
not even once.
no matter how much we want it.
even if we want it really bad.
that is what we decided.
uhm, right!
...it is kind of hard though!
yeah.
you know, when two people have a connection, you know, that is... just seems like such a... waste.
...i hate waste.
...ross?
yes?
just so you know... with us... it is never off the table. (she enters her room and closes the door.)
damn it. it is never off the table. (he leaves the apartment)
okay, can you really tapdance?
no.
it is off the resumé. (she strikes it through with a pencil)
archery?
no.
horseback riding?
would fall off a lot.
you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
that i can do.
come on! you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
all right, watch me! (he takes a full container of milk from the fridge) okay, you time me. ready?
ready... go!
(checking her watch) you did it!
hey, you guys! guess what? barry and mindy are getting a divorce!
oh my god!
wow!
(to ross) what is the matter with you?!
no! barry and mindy.
oh sorry, i hear divorce i immediately go to ross. (to rachel) who-who is barry and mindy?
barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend.
ohh-oh, was not he cheating on you with her?
yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
why did they get divorced?
well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. is not that sad? (giggles.) god, could you imagine if i actually married him?! i mean how different would my life be?
i know what you mean, I have always wondered how different my life would be if-if I would never gotten divorced.
which time?
the first time! no seriously, imagine if carol had not realized she was a lesbian.
(starts to imagine it) i can not. i keep seeing it the good way.
I would bet I would still be doing my kara-tay. (that is karate, he is just saying it that way.) towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
and what if i was still fat? (to chandler) well, you would not be dating me, that is for sure.
sure i would!
what, you guys really think that I am that shallow?
no, i just think monica was that fat.
hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives! (closes his eyes to do so.) oh-hey, there is carol again!
what if i had had the guts to quit my job? I would probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my job’s fun too! i mean tomorrow, i-i do not have to wear a tie.
what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch?
what?!
merrill lynch?
yeah, i had a massage client who worked there and-and he said i had a knack for stocks.
well why did not you take the job?
because at that time you see, i thought everything that rhymed was true. so i thought y’know that if I would work with stocks, I would have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we would still hang out?
(recognizing her) oh my god! rachel green?
(gasps) rob tillman!
no-no. it is-it is me, ross!
oh, I am sorry. ross tillman.
no, no-no, ross geller.
ohh, of course monica’s brother!
yeah. right.
wow! how are you?!
good-good, I am-I am married. (shows her his ring.)
ohh! me too!
is-is not it the best?
oh, it is the best! (they both exhale contemplating the joys of marriage.) so, umm how is monica?
oh really, really great! yeah! a-actually she is right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? you should stop bye and say hi.
ohh, i would love too.
yeah? oh-oh, she would be so excited!
ohh! okay!
come on! (they start to leave.)
oh wait, do not you have to pay for your, (looks at his magazine) busty ladies?
no, it is okay. some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but i do not…
(laughs) oh yeah? okay.
(putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) okay.
but! do not you have to give him his money back?
uh-huh. (steps to a random kid nearby and hands him his money.) hey, here you go buddy. sorry, no porn for you. (to rachel) okay, let us go see monica!
so monica, still going out with dr. boring huh?
he is not boring! he is just-he is just low key.
thanks.
(not impressed) wow!!
oh dear god, let me think. (starts to sarcastically think about it.)
(entering, depressed) hey.
hey.
oh no! what is the matter?
oh i just got another rejection letter. they said my writing was funny, just not "archie comic funny."
okay.
bye.
was his question what is more boring than him?
hey man, look sorry about that archie thing. do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride.
really?
ehh.
maybe joey does not have to give you the money, tv stars have assistants right?
that is an idea! (to chandler) hey, if i hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
no joey! chandler could be your assistant! see, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
that is great! that would be great! let us do that!
i could use the money; it could give me time to write.
oh right great! welcome aboard!
okay!
all right! now hey, i need to use the bathroom. since i do not need any assistance in there, take a break!
all right!
(entering) hey!
hey phoebe! guess what?
what?
joey just hired chandler to be his assistant!
ohh that is so sweet! (her cell phone rings.) oh! hang on! (quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) hang onnnnnn!!! (gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (on phone.) go!! no! no-no! i said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it is a number! it comes after 4-9!! no, it is okay. it is okay, you are allowed one mistake. just kidding, you are of course fired.
hey mon!
hey!
mon, look who i ran into! (gestures towards rachel.)
(gets up and gasps) oh my god! rachel!! (rachel is stunned to see that her long lost friend is still fat.) (monica goes over and gives rachel a big bear hug, which is quite easy for her.) you look terrific!
ohh, so do you! did you lose weight? (she is not quite sure of that one.)
you are so sweet to notice! yes, i lost three and a half pounds!
and, and uh, you-you remember my friend chandler. (points to him.)
hey.
oh yeah.
and that is phoebe over there! (points to her.)
hi!
oh my god, sit down! sit down! how long as it been since we have seen each other?
(answering it) 1987, the day after christmas, at sean mcmahon’s party. i played you one of my songs, y’know interplanetary courtship ritual.
oh yeah. right. so now, are—do you, do you still do music?
sometimes, you should come over (joey returns from the bathroom) sometime! I will play you one of my other…
(interrupting him and seeing joey) oh my god! joey tribbiani from days of our lives, just walked in here!
rach, he is a friend of ours.
(stunned) you are friends with dr. drake remoray?
well it is kind of hard to be friends with drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he is not real.
(to rachel) hey-hey, or i could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
he is coming over! he is coming over!
(getting up) joey!
(holding a plate of what looks like rice crispies treats) i know, here-here!! (hands her the plate.)
ohhh! (takes the plate.) no! this is my friend rachel, we went to high school together.
(giggles and can not look at him) hi!
(shaking rachel’s hand) hi!
(still not quite able to look at him) hi! i love you on that show! i watch you everyday! i mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…
well, it is always nice to meet the fans.
ah!
(turning and whispering to monica) she is not crazy is she?
no.
(to rachel) so uh, how you doing?
hang on! hang on! hang on! (answering the phone.) go!! who is this? (listens) oh okay, you are going to like working for me. what is your name? (listens) what kind of name is brendy? i… whatever… stop talking! all right, from now on your name is joan. you can pick your own last name.
(entering) hey there you are!
uh-oh, it is my boss!
all right, here is a list of things for you to do today. man, this going to be so great! thank you so much! all right, i got to go to work I am delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (exits.)
(reading the list) drop off my dry cleaning. pick up my vitamins. teach me how to spell vitamins. wear in my new jeans.
(laughs) you realize what you are do not you?
what?
you are his bitch.
(yelling from monica’s room) no-no!! no!!
(panicked) oh wait! you did not just sit on my kit-kats did you?!!
no! there-there was a little, a little diff in the market and i lost 13 million dollars.
but the kit-kats are all right?!
what am i going to do?! what am i going to do?! i can not call my office they will kill me! i can not call my clients they will kill themselves! great, now my chest hearts.
what?!
(louder) my chest hurts! oh, and now i-i can not breathe.
phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
oh, if i were, would-would i have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
yes!!
then yes that is what I am having. (takes another puff of the cigarette.)
oh my god!
come on pheebs, it is not that bad! y’know most people would be excited if they did not have to work for a couple of weeks.
most people do not like their jobs, i love my job! i have not been working for three hours and I am already going crazy. i miss joan.
honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.
i always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die! (phoebe glares at him.) but you are not going to die. i mean, you are going to die, but you are not going to die today. i wish i was dead.
let us take a walk. (they start to leave.) y’know maybe you should consider writing for talking out of your ass magazine! (they exit.)
(to ross) so what is going on with you?
well umm, I have been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
still going through that dry spell with carol?
yeah.
how long has it been since you had sex?
well, last weekend…
oh that is not so bad.
…will be two months…
that is.
…since i stopped trying.
maybe you need to spice things up a little.
what-what do you mean?
i do not know. you could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
oh.
y’know, dirty talk, m�nage � trois, toys…
wow!
roll playing… you could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. you could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
okay, i think i got it.
yeah! or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you are-you are-you are rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching! (ross looks at her.) it never happened.
sorry. so how is it going with joey?
oh just great. he beeps me now with codes. one is, "bring me food." two is, "I am with a girl, bring us food." three is, "I am lost and i can not find food."
(entering) hey! is uh, is she going to be all right?
yeah! she is right in there! (points to phoebe’s room.)
oh great. (starts to go in.) (to chandler) hey! go take off those pants, they look ready!
all right, and over there is brady’s pub where i like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
wow! this is so amazing! what else? what else?
well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (points at a large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) and uh that is an old man! hey old man!
hey!
all righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
(laughs) wow! umm, y’know, i-i would really love to, but i-i should not.
why? (in drake’s voice.) why can not the world stop turning, just for a moment? just for us?
(awestruck, then not) is not that a line from the show?!
uh, yeah but uh, (in drake’s voice) i may have said those things before but, i never truly meant them. until now.
that is a line from the show too!
okay, you watch too much tv.
(approaching) here you go joe, here is the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (hands it to him.)
thanks! (looks at it.) yeah, there is pulp in that. (hands it back.)
yeah?
i thought we talked about this. i do not like pulp. no pulp. pulp is not juice. all juice, okay?
I am sorry, i guess i just like the pulp.
oh my god, I am sorry, I am being so rude. (turns to rachel.) rachel, would like a soda or something? because chandler would run right out and get it.
yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
(to chandler) iced tea.
okay, anything for you sir?
(to rachel) did i not just tell him?
(mouthing it to him) yes, you did.
(to chandler) okay look, chandler, if this (motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (tugs on his ear.) (chandler glares at him.) you are going to throw that juice at me, are not ya?
it is not all juice! (rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
so honey, this morning was fun, huh? me hopping in on you in the shower there.
look carol umm, i was, i was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
carol our sex life is—it is just not working…
hey there little fella! hey, uh-hey, why do not we get some shoes on ya, huh? hey, why do not you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! yay!!
yay! (to carol) seriously, our sex life… i was thinking, maybe i do not know, we could try some-some new things. y’know? for fun?
well i do not know umm, (pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (carol’s shocked and obviously does not like that idea.) umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (carol does not like that idea either.) nah! umm, y’know we-we could try dirty talk? (carol still says no.) umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
who sold a story to archie comics?!
oh my god! that is great! oh wow! (hugs him.) you are a published writer! i wish i had a present for you!
aww.
wait a minute! (quickly checks her pockets and pulls out…) my last kit-kat bar!
you want to share it?
okay!!
(entering) hey! hey chandler look, i know you are mad, but i just want to say I am sorry. i-i was a total jerk. completely of-over the line. uh, i just i hate pulp! y’know? i mean, y’know how monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
it is not mayonnaise!!
yeah, of-of-of-of-okay anyway, i just wanted to say I am sorry. here. (hands him a cup.)
what is this?
fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! just the way you like it.
aww, thanks man. (they hug.)
hey joey, chandler sold a story to archie comics!
oh my god! that is great! congratulations! what is the story?!
oh you would not uh, care. it is just a stupid comic book story.
are you kidding me?! i love archie! and the whole gang!
well uh, archie needs money to fix his jalopy (joey laughs), uh but he does not want reggie to just give him the money. so reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. and then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can not have lumps in them.
wait a minute. that sounds a little familiar! did they already do that one? ‘because i think i read it!
oh mon, listen i have to ask! okay, joey tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
yeah, a lot. a lot, a lot!
ohh! and I am one of them!! wow! oh, i just cannot believe this! i mean, joey tribbiani!
well, y’know it is none of my business, but are not you married?
yeah. oh i just wish we could not be married for a little bit! y’know i just wish we could be like on a break!
well, you are not.
oh, it is so easy for you i mean, you are not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
yeah i can! (laughs) and do not think i do not, because i do! i mean all the time, you betcha! (laughs.)
monica. you have, you have done it right?
(giggles) of course i have! what do you think, I am some 30 year old virgin?
oh my god! you are a 30 year old virgin!
say it louder, i do not think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
it is not like, i have not any opportunities. i mean, y’know, I am just waiting for the perfect guy. I am seeing this guy roger, all right? he is not perfect, but umm, i think maybe i should just get it over with. y’know, give him my flower.
oh my god!! do it!! honey, you have waited long enough!!
y’know what? you are right?!
yes!! i mean sex does not have to be a big deal! there should not be all this rules and restrictions! y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…
rachel! I am never going to think it is okay for you to cheat on your husband!
oh what do you know? virgin!
phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
phoebe! put that cigarette out!
no! it is not a cigarette! the smoke is coming out of me!
put it out!!
okay! okay! (puts it out and comes out of the bathroom.) I am so glad you are here.
come on. (helps her into bed as her phone rings.) i got it.
oh, give it to me.
i got it!
give it!
(on the phone) hello? (listens.) no she can not come to the phone right now. (listens.) oh, right no problem. okay, bye-bye. (hangs up.)
was it my work? were they mad? was it jack? did he yell?!
j-j-just relax, nobody yelled. jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
thank god.
(to monica) yeah, she is fired.
(very relived) oh! thank god!
okay! (she picks up the phone, joey’s phone number, and starts to dial.) here we go! okay! (on phone.) hi, joey! it is rachel! umm, i am free tomorrow night. yeah, sure, sure i can bring some sandwiches.
so honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, i mean how-how are you going to start to find…
oh. (he takes the notepad she was using and looks at it.) wow! (flips to another page.) huh. (flips another page.) boy! (flips another page.) well, someone is been doing their homework. (flips two more pages.)
oh, i know. (laughs) y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kind of…
yeah? well, i-i think ben’s asleep.
yeah. right. save it. i can do that. (gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
hey, pheebs!
hey.
hey, how is it going?
well, I have got to get out of this bed, I am going crazy here. crazy!
(handing her a cup) here you go sweetie.
what the hell is this, herbal tea? i hate herbal tea!
but, i put some honey in it.
she does not know she was fired yet, does she?
no, the doctors say it may kill her.
what are you two girls whispering about over there?!
(to ross) but i think we should tell her.
hey pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
okay, what is this? a stupid contest? because we got a winner here! (points at ross.)
listen phoebe, he is right. people are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
i know! but if i did not work there, what else would i do?
well, you used to like playing the guitar.
yeah that was lucrative! smart like your brother!
uh, what about y’know the massage thing? that never gave you a heart attack.
hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do i do?! what will i do?!
ohh, i mean it is just so realistic!
i know. (joey is sitting in this tall chair that is made up of balls on polls. you will have to see it to know what i mean.) yeah, his name is pat.
pat the dog. oh! oh! i get it!! (laughs and finishes her drink.)
(climbing down from his chair) do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?
oh, i probably should not—so i will! (joey starts making her refill and rachel notices that rain thing joey has.) oh! wow! it is like it is raining!
pretty cool, huh? but if you are thinking you can put a fish in there and it would not get sucked up into the mechanism, well you would be wrong.
umm, can i use your bathroom?
it is uh, right through there. (points.)
okay. (starts to go.) god y’know, if someone told me a week ago that i would be peeing in joey tribbiani’s apartment…
yeah, life’s pretty great is not it?
yeah, it sure is!
i hope you are hungry, we are starting with oysters. and y’know what they say about oysters, do not you?
no! umm well, some people say that oysters are an aphrodisiac.
people! people say it! come here! (she grabs him and kisses him.)
and then we are going to have a little middle eastern cous-cous. something we can eat, with our hands.
no-no-no, no! it is sensual!
okay! (they kiss again and his beeper goes off.) ohhh no!
i can not promise anything. (she starts to dig in.)
we are really going to do this, huh?
y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at… (a knock on the door interrupts him.)
okay.
I am-I am ross by the way.
how hot is this?!
I am sorry you are here with me instead of roger.
yeah, me too.
well, i could make it seem like he is here. (imitates him.) "here is some little known facts about cous-cous. they did not add the second cous until 1979." (mumbles something further.)
stop it!! that is not funny!!
okay.
I am sorry, okay? it just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
what was tonight?
you do not want to know what tonight was.
okay. (pause.) what was tonight?
well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.
with roger? (monica shyly looks away.) not just with roger?! (monica shrugs.) oh my god!
all right relax mr. I have had sex four times!
four different women! I have had sex way more times!
how many?
nine.
i was just waiting for the perfect guy.
well good, good for you. you really think that roger is the perfect guy?
no. he is not a horrible guy.
hey that is what i tell girls about me.
chandler, I am going to die a virgin!
no you are not! you are sweet and wonderful and this is going to happen for you.
oh really? when? do you want to do it with me?
okay. (they both realize what he just said.)
i was kidding.
so was i.
joey, you are such an amazing actor! (he smiles.) how do you know where dr. drake remoray leaves off and joey tribbiani begins?
well, with dr. drake they always tell me what to say. and with joey, i pretty much have to make it up on my own.
wow! tell me something joey—(she falls off the couch)—whoa! i just fell right off the couch there.
yeah you did.
okay. (she climbs back onto the couch.)
here you go. let me ask you a question.
yeah?
when was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
wow! i can not, i can not feel my hands.
come, come here.
we can not do this.
no! (they both laugh.) oyster?
yeah! (takes it.) if-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? because you have been waiting a very long time and i would not want to disappoint you.
yeah but see i have nothing to compare it too. so even if you are horrible, how would i know?
i do like that.
it is harder for me! i have those four other women to compete with!
well, if it helps there were only three. so it would just be for tonight, right?
absolutely! it would just be one friend (points at chandler) helping out another friend. (points at herself.)
stop it! we are doing this! let us do it!
noo!! okay!!
okay! (they both get up.)
umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
i have some moves.
i have no moves. (he moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) okay, What are you doing there?! (giggles.) oh y’know what? I am sorry, this is just too weird.
yeah, let us just forget it.
what if i turn out the lights? (runs to shut them off.)
okay!
oh yeah.
chandler?
(sexily) yeah?
that is the couch.
oh my god!
i know! I will tell you something, we are going to do that again!
oh, okay! (he rolls over to do that again.)
(entering) morning!
(wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) oh right.
yeah.
(groans) oh god. oh i can not believe joey tribbiani heard me throw up!
well he actually saw you a little bit too.
noo! oh god we did—we did not, we did not uhh…
no! no! no, not after seeing that.
god I am just a horrible person.
wh-why?
because I am married. that is right, i am a married woman! and i came to a tv star’s apartment to have an affair! uck!
that is ridiculous! I am not a "star," just a regular famous actor.
yeah and I am a horrible, horrible person.
rachel, would you stop saying that?! hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when caprice was dying and she gave me…
the ring from the cave, yeah.
wow! uh okay, well uh… (he gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)
(seeing the ring and gasping) oh my god, they let you keep that stuff?!
sure! as long as they do not find out you can keep whatever you want! and i want you to have it.
no! no-no-no…
yes! yes!! and every time you look at it, i want you to remember that you are a good person. okay, you have had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you did not. and that is what this ring stands for.
but i thought that ring stood for caprice’s undying love for her brother.
look, do you want the ring or not?!
yeah!
hey!
hey!
look at you! you are up!
all right!
i thought I would try to take a walk. would you pour me some water? I will be back soon.
whoa-whoa-whoa! you are not going to use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
no. I have learned my lesson.
let us go! come on! move it! (grabs her coat.) come on! (to an old man who is holding her shoes and briefcase.) shoes! briefcase! (takes them both.) thanks lou, good luck with the gall bladder. (she leaves.)
hey joe did… did you ever have a threesome?
(not quite sure of how to answer that) well uh, look ross i uh, i think carol’s great and I am sure you are a very attractive man, but i….
no! the reason I am asking is that… i sorta had one last night.
you?
yeah!
wow!
yeah!
all right! so, was it amazing?
it was, it was okay.
just okay—did you do it right?!
look, it is just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "would really anyone miss me if i were not here?"
huh. but still ross, you are worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! y’know what i mean?
oh-oh, absolutely!
it is just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
but you got to be with both of them, right?
not-not really. th-th-there was just carol.
not the other one?
no, she kept kicking me away!
yeah, you do not want that.
no!
well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
oh i a lot of stuff!
you got a little bored?
a little. yeah. i made a snack.
yeah? what did ya have?
just a sandwich. turkey, a little mustard…
sounds good.
it really was!
hey!
hey!
let me tell you about this chick i scored with last night! oh no wait a minute that was you!
hey, check me out, I am a slut!
so you uh, want to do something tonight?
oh i can not. dr. roger is coming over again.
oh. oh right! right! because you are still seeing him and uh, he is a good guy. i mean, i remember a time when… (he fakes falling asleep.)
are you okay?
yeah! totally! totally, and you?
great! it is so amazing! i mean, last time dr. roger came over, i was so nervous, but then after being with you I am all like, "can the doctor see me now?"
i bet he can.
y’know, i do not have an appointment, but i sure could use a physical. (he laughs halfheartedly) are you sure you are okay?
oh yeah! yeah! do not worry about me, I will be fine! (does a kara-tay move.)
ohh! my god! barry!!
oh that is right! I am sorry! i-i am early! finish! please!!
surprise! look who is back!
hey!
uh, i do not think so!
jack!! hey!
all better! back to work! except this clown from research told me i was fired. he should do his research, huh?
nu-uh!
oh, okay i did not get that message. so this does not count—anyway, I will be in my office.
that is all right, I will work here. this is goo, next to this plant. (she picks a place in the lobby next to a plant.)
you are in my office! look, i have made a lot of cash for this company! okay? i am talking big bucks! pesos! yen! rubles! you make one little mistake…
oh, so this is all about money! y’know it is bad enough that—ow! oh, you have got to be kidding!
I am having another heart attack!
I am having another heart attack!! call 9-1-1!!
(to arthur, he is the guy calling 9-1-1) dumbass!
well, they fired me and I am having heart attack.
yeah.
hi ross!
hey rachel.
is joey tribbiani here?
umm, no.
well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I am looking for him and that this i am not going to throw up!
that-that is always good news. are you okay?
me? I am great! I am fine! I am sooo good!! but, you know who is not great?! men! you are a man right ross?!
yeah.
sit down!
okay. (he does so.)
let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! and why is it that the second we tell you we are going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!
we are sorry.
no seriously! seriously! what has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
did not you spend last night at joey’s?
aw what are you?! a detective?
look i-i do not know what is going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can i just say not all men are like that.
oh. (does not believe it.)
hey! there are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! okay? there are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
who are these men?
men. i guy i know.
well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers) gay.
she is not… (realizes) she is gay. oh my god. she is so gay! i can not believe this.
good day for married people huh?
I am sorry your husband cheated on you.
I am sorry your wife is gay. i guess women are not that great either.
try telling my wife that.
(sticking his head in the door) okay to come in?
yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. dr. roger got beeped again.
yeah i know, guess who beeped him?
what?!
I am the ruptured spleen. (laughs.)
why would you do that?
because you should not be with him. (pause.) you should be with me.
really?
yeah! when you were talking about roger, that was killing me! look, things like last night they do not just happen. y’know? or at least not to me. or with the other two women, in the morning y’know i was just lying there and i could not wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you i always y’know with a friend.
chandler!
i know you probably do not want to go out with me, y’know because i make too many jokes and I have never been in a serious relationship and i guess I am not technically a "doctor…"
there was just one woman, was not there?
no, there were two.
including me?
oh yeah.
(singing)
I am tellin' you ross, she wants you.
she barely knows me. we just live in the same building.
any contact?
she lent me an egg once.
you are in!
aw, right.
hey. (stutters something incoherent)
come on, ross, you got to get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—i do not think we need a third...
excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the she will? thanks.
an egg?
yeah, you are going to go up to her and say, "here is your egg back, I am returning your egg."
i think it is winning.
i think it is insane.
she will love it. go with the egg, my friend.
think it will work?
no, it is suicide. the man's got an egg.
you can not do this.
do what, do what?
roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
no! phoebes! do not you remember why you dumped the guy?
because he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it is nice to have a date on valentine's day!
but phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. i know i do.
well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
actually, tomorrow night kind of depends on how tonight goes.
oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
no, no, no, do not you dare bail on me. the only reason she is going out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend.
yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a...
pathetic mess? i know, but—come on, man, she is needy, she is vulnerable. I am thinkin', cha-ching! (rachel throws a roll at joey. he picks it up and eats it.) thanks. look, you have not been out with a woman since janice. you are doing this.
hi. she said yes.
yes! way to go, man! (chandler and ross hug. something crunches in ross' shirt pocket.) still got the egg, huh?
(looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) how do i look?
oh, uh, i... do not... care. (joey's date shows up) ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess.
...and what did you bring?
janice?
(angrily) hey, it is janice.
ok, I am makin' a break for it, I am going out the window.
no, no, no, do not! I have been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine. just calm down.
calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that I have dumped twice in the last five months!
(at the urinal) can you stop yellin'? you are makin' me nervous, and i can not go when I am nervous.
I am sorry, I am sorry, you are right. (gets up right behind joey and yells in his ear) come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
ok, ok, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney.
which one was pete carney?
pete the weeper? remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) "was it good for you?"
yeah, well, I will take a little crying any day over howard-the-"i-win"-guy. (imitating) "i win! i win!" i went out with the guy for two months—i did not get to win once.
how did we end up with these jerks? we are good people!
i do not know. maybe we are some kind of magnets.
i know i am. that is why i can not wear a digital watch.
there is more beer, right?
oh! you know my friend abby who shaves her head? she said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
yeah. so, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. it is valentine's day. it is perfect.
ok, well, what kind of ritual?
ok. we can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
or?
or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
burning's good.
burning's good. yeah, i got stuff to burn.
good for you. (jumps suddenly) uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
that is ok.
(to lorraine) we can not do that.
(disgusted) what? what can not you do?
uh, can i talk to you for a second, over there?
uh, we might be leaving now.
tell me it is "you and me" we.
she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I am not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it.
ok, you can not do this to me.
you are right, I am sorry. you are right.
I am outta here. here is my credit card. dinner's on me. I am sorry, chandler.
i hope she throws up on you.
so...
oh, what a crappy night!
excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) how ya doing?
joey's not a friend. he is...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert? a big screen tv?
you got it. good woman! (the waiter turns around, it is a man) could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
that is right, each. oh, and a uh rob roy. (to janice) I have always wanted to know...
no... no! and yet it did. good-bye, janice.
oh, chandler, sorry.
ohhh, chandler, sorry! hey, janice.
ok, well, this was very special.
rach, come see who is out here!
oh my god. janice, hi!
janice is going to go away now.
I will be right back.
oh, joey, look who it is.
(in disbelief) whoa.
oh, good, joey's home now.
oh, hi, ross. yeah. there is someone i want you to say hi to. (to chandler) he just happened to call.
I am just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from new york to los angeles, he does not just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
the blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
if you want to put a label on it.
nope, nope, that is it.
oh, and she is pregnant with my baby. i always forget that part. (to carol and susan) helloo!
ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
all i have is, is oregano and a fresca.
um, that is ok! (throws it in fire) ok. all right. now we need the semen of a righteous man.
ok, pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we would not be doing the ritual in the first place.
can we just start throwing things in?
ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) oh, ok.
(tossing things in the fire) ok, barry's letters. adam ritter's boxer shorts.
ok, and i have the, uh receipt for my dinner with nokululu oon ah ah.
look, here is a picture of scotty jared naked.
(looking at picture) hey he is wearing a sweater.
no.
and here we have the last of paulo's grappa.
hey, rachel, is not that stuff almost pure...
how can i dump this woman on valentine's day?
i do not know. you dumped her on new year's.
oh, man. in my next life, I am coming back as a toilet brush.
hi, just janice.
(to chandler) if you do not do it, i will.
so, um, what do you do for a living?
now that is funny. hey, do you think...would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us? because she is, she is alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
are you sure? great. carol? want to come over and join us?
come on. these people'll scooch down. you guys'll scooch, will not you? let us try scooching! come on. come on. uh, kristen riggs, this is carol willick. carol, kristin. uh, carol teaches sixth grade. and, kristin, kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, was not even her major!
you know, it is a really funny story how this happened.
really?
is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) chan and jan forever.
ok, janice. janice. hey, janice. look, there is no way for me to tell you this. at least there is no new way for me to tell you this. i just do not things are going to work out.
(surprised) it is?
oh no, you see, actually it is.
oh, no i do not.
i did, but...
call me!
you did so. i swear, i swear—(noticing kristin's absence) how long has she been in the bathroom?
well maybe it is cold in there. or maybe i screwed up the first date i had in 9 years.
oh, god. (he puts his head down on the grill) you know, this is still pretty hot. (he picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. carol picks it off and eats it.)
no, it is just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. well, do i have to? i mean, I am sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she is perfectly nice, and, but that there is, that is it. and um, and then I am here talkin' to you, and, and it is easy, and it is fun, and, and i do not, i do not have to...you know, here is a wacky thought. um, what is say you and i give it another shot? no no no, i know what you are going to say, you are a lesbian. but what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? let us just stick a pin in it, ok? because, we are great together, you know. you can not deny it. besides, you are carrying my baby. i mean, how perfect is that? but see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there is something right here. i love you.
no but, no but.
that is easy for you to say, you found one already.
so, um, will you bring the truck?
oh, my god.
see, there you go, the cleansing works!
they are nice guys.
oh, they are firemen guys.
okay, pick a card.
okay. (he picks the 9 of spades)
all right now, memorize it. (pause) you got it?
oh yes.
(holding up the queen of clubs) is that your card? (he winks and smiles.)
(pause) yes.
hi!
hi there!
what are you talking about?!
(sets ben down) well, it is not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he is auditioning.
(reading the card) whoa! this guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! (ross gasps) ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! (ross and carol stare at him, then joey realizes what he just said.) i mean, way to go ben! (gives ben the thumbs up, which ben returns.) man! I have been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
i know, it is crazy! we were just pushing ben on the swings…
I am always on the swings! what am i doing wrong?!
that.
(entering from her room) okay, got to go! wish me luck!
luck!
hey rach, now that you are working at ralph lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
uh well, y'know what? i do not think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
besides, if anybody's going to get free stuff, it is going to be me.
okay guys, way to wish me luck!
okay, let us discuss rachel's birthday. i say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
whoa-whoa, but her birthday is not like for another month.
yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it is not a surprise.
i think it is a great idea. yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
ross!! we are having a surprise party for rachel!!
(from the bathroom) okay!!
done.
okay, great so do you want to do it together?
i would love to do it together!
they are going to do it together.
dude! that is my girlfriend!
what, so i got to shut it down now?
all right, i got to take off. I am picking up ben then we are off to the big audition.
it is going to be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad.
yeah.
weirder than watching his two moms make out? (monica nods in agreement.)
whoa-whoa dad? there is a dad in the commercial?
yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
whoa, hey, maybe I will go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad. i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather.
you are not his godfather.
what?! are you kidding?!
(pause) of course i am! (joey is relieved) okay, let us go godfather.
all right!
hey! I am in, they are going to let me audition!
really? that is great!
i know! i know! it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so i steered clear of her…
oh yeah, yeah! he is done tons of commercials. I have seen him in like sugar smacks, playstation, and that one for the phone company. in fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. chandler was mad….
yeah well, he is not going to get this one. ben is way cuter than that kid. i mean look at him, look at you, (starts to whine like a baby and joey just glares at him.)
that is great. listen, would not it be great though if i got to play ben's dad?
joey, you look nothing like ben.
i look more like him than you do! (he winks at carol.)
well umm, that one is pretty but uh, i just, i just love this fabric (on the other one.) sorry.
(laughing nervously) oh, what a fun office.
oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories…(stops and tries to change directions)…about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
that does not seem fair.
i know! it is like I am being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
yeah, it is the best.
i mean what if this keeps happening? y'know, they will-they will be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I will just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she is going to pick? me or smokey smokerson?
rachel, you can go down there, you do not have to smoke. just say you want to get some fresh air.
yeah, i can do that.
yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey rach, you want to get some coffee?
i would love to!
oh good!
yeah, i want to go to babe.
oh good.
oh wait, i change my mind! (she slams the door on them.) okay, let us talk about the party! i have so many ideas! (holds up a cocktail napkin.)
yeah, me too! (runs and grabs her 3-ring binder of ideas.)
oh, look at that.
all right, that is a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what i thought we would start out with tuscan style finger food, and for music, here is an alphabetized list of all my cds! I have highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
what happened to the intimate dinner party?
oh, we are not doing that. okay…
so wow, it looks like you took care of everything. thanks a lot, co-host.
what?! i did not take care of everything, there is-there is plenty of things for you to do!
like what?
(thinks) cups.
cups? you are giving me cups?
and ice!
cups and ice? ooh, i get to be in charge of cups and ice? (thinks of something) all right. fine, okay, i will be in charge of cups and ice!
wait a minute, i can get ice at the restaurant…
i got it! mine!
(entering, downtrodden) hi.
hey! how did the audition go?!
not so good.
wait a minute, are you doing joey's (sadly) "audition did not go so well. (happily) yeah it did?"
(pause) yeah i am! yeah, ben got a second audition!
(also downtrodden) yeah, i had to teach ross my bit because i actually did not get a callback.
you got a callback too did not you?
(happily) yeah i did!
oh well, it is kind of lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air.
oh great!
oh that is okay.
excuse me, can i, can i bum one of those? (he holds up his pack.) y'know what, actually… (she takes the one he is smoking and heads over to where nancy and kim are standing and laughing.) okay, okay, okay, what is so funny over here?
oh, i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? y'know what i mean, like dubbies? and i actually, i thought to myself, "wow, those guys are crazy!" but no, i actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
oh, me too.
(laughs) oh, me too.
oh god, this is so nerve wracking! how-how do you do this?
well, unfortunately, i do not get many callbacks so…
who knows?
yes!! i knew it!! (to the people who did not make it.) bye-bye! so long! later!
oh this is great! i might actually get to play ben's dad!
yeah!
man, this is going to be kind of weird.
yeah, it is.
no, we-we are going to be like best friends, that is why it is going to be weird.
(entering, carrying two garbage bags) hey!
is it okay if i leave this stuff here 'til rachel's birthday party?
ah sure. what is in  them?
umm, cups.
oh good, because uh we got rachel 800 gallons of water.
seriously that is a lot of cups.
yeah well, that is because monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and monica is going to rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
y'know i rued the day once…did not get a whole lot else done.
okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. (she goes and opens the door to joey.) oh, hi joey!
hey pheebs! (to the guys) hey!
hey!
ross good, I am uh glad you are here. i want to talk to you about something.
what is up?
well, I have been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against ben, the two of us competing, and that can not lead to anything good. so, i think I am just going to step aside. I am going to tell them that i will not audition.
wow, uh, joey that is-that is great. thanks man.
that is it? you are-you are going to let me do this?! this-this is my career we are talking about here!
well, you just…
i just said that so you would not let ben do it! look ross, if anyone should step aside it should be ben!
what?!
what? chandler! tell  them!
(shocked) well i mean, let me get the door first. (goes and opens the door.) oh, hi! no one. (exits.)
why should ben step aside? it was his audition in the first place! you-you just tagged along! you are like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
at least i care about his feelings!
what?!
do you know how hard this is going to be on him when he does not get it?
and why would not he get it?
oh, come on! have you seen what my kid can do?! huh?! i mean he dials phones! he-he-he eats tortilla chips! he-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
you just give him a spoon baby!
oh yeah? i guess we will just see!
yeah! because this commercial belongs to me and mitch!
you are kid's name is raymond!
yeah?! so is yours!
(to rachel) how did work go?
oh it was great! it was great! i went down there just like you said, y'know? and we talked business. kim totally took my opinions.
you stink!
thanks!
no, I am-I am serious!
well-well that is because i went down there and they were all smoking. this is actually the smell of success.
okay, there is something different though--oh my god! you smoked!
i did not!
yes you did! you look happy and sick; you smoked!
all right, fine! but i had too! i had to do it for my career!
i wish i had smoked for my career…
that is so gross!
no well, no it is not that bad, y'know? i mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, i actually feel like i can throw up.
okay, but you got to push past this because it is about to get so good!
chandler! i have to tell you, you smell so smokey i have to get up. I am not kidding. (she is not; she stands and walks away. chandler moves closer.)
i think you smell great! (he sniffs her shoulder.)
i am so on board! (she throws away her recently lit cigarette.)
yeah, i did, but y'know what? i am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? (laughs) good luck, rach.
well then let us just quit! we will just quit! let us all quit!
oh but you could. you can. absolutely! we can help each other out! we can get--what are those--those patches! we could be like the patch sisters!
yes! great! give me those cigs! give it! give it! (she grabs their cigarettes and lighters and throws them in the trash.)
okay then! (she starts rummaging through the trash to find kim's lighter.)
hmmm, soup! (tries again.) hmm soup! (tries again, with a little caveman thrown in.) hmm, soup!
oh yeah, no problem.
(goes over to ben) hi ben! so you want to be an actor huh? i got to tell ya, it is no picnic. there is tons of rejection. no stability. one day you are dr. drake remoray, the next day you are eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
(entering, angrily) joey!
(angrily) ross!
(angrily) ben! (pause.) (happily.) i mean, ben! ben!
hi!
uh-oh.
well this is noodle soup and uh, I have been working with tomato. but that is okay, no problem. no problem. hmm, noodle soup.
oh, what did i say?
how is that different? (she looks at him until he gets it.) oh! yeah!
hmm, noodle soup.
okay.
hmm, soup. (pause.) i mean, noodle soup. i mean soup!
no! no! i-i can do it one more time! see? look! (eats another spoonful) hmm, noodle soup. damnit! (storms out.)
hey! hey-hey-hey!!
come on you guys! what are doing?! i thought we were the patch sisters!
well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could have at least told me! come on, give me one of those! what are we talking about?
oh wait, no-no-no! drag me down. drag-drag me down.
okay. (starts to walk away.)
(hearing that) oh man!
(to chandler) check it out! cup hat! (points to her hat.) cup banner! cup chandelier! and the thing that started it all, the cup! (holds up one.)
great job with the cups, pheebs!
(overhearing that) why do not you just go out with her!
(following him) and did you notice the ice? (gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) look! we have it all! we have crushed! cubed! and dry! watch! (pours some water onto the dry ice, causing it to evaporate/smoke.) ahhh! mystical!
awesome!
chandler! everyone--no one's eating my tuscan finger food because they are all filling up on phoebe's snow cones!
there are snow cones! (monica glares at him.) snow cones! yuck!
y'know…go! go! right there! (points)
thank you! thank you! (runs to the snow cone machine.)
(noticing her) oh, look! look! look!
what?! what?! my birthday's not for another month!
that is the surprise!
oh my god! you guys this is so great! i mean it is so unexpected! i mean chandler's birthday is even before mine!
wow! this is great! look at all these cups! this is so weird.
i was in charge of cups.
oh, okay, not so weird.
hey!
hey.
listen man, uh, I am sorry the audition did not go so well.
yeah right! (gets up for a refill to his snow cone.)
no really, i-i am! i feel bad!
yeah? well look ross, you do not have to. okay? it is not your fault i suck. i mean what kind of an actor can not even say, "hmm, noodle soup." (nods his head in disgust.)
yeah y'know what? maybe-maybe you did not mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
what you do mean?
i think, sub-consciously…
wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
(pause) i think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that ben would get the part.
well, you are way sounds a lot better than mine. (thinks about it.) yeah. yeah! it is not that I am a bad actor…
no!
no, it is just ah, i care so damn much about little ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
there you go. thank you!
thank you! so, did-did he get it?
no.
eh, what are you going to do?
(to kim and nancy) oh, hi! excuse me, is uh rachel green here? i was supposed to meet her for lunch.
okay, great.
I will catch you guys later. (exits.)
(to the nurse) hi.
hi, yeah, hi! I am umm, phoebe buffay, and i have babies coming out of me.
not yet. umm, i heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
oh my god!
it is all right.
oh no, none of them are the father. the father is my brother.
i am so going to miss watching you freak people out like that!
okay, uh pheebs, quick. look! this (his video camera) is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? y'know before it all starts?
oh, okay, umm, hi kids! um, it is me, aunt phoebe. i can not wait to see you. please do not hurt me!
hey, what took you guys so long? your cab left when ours did!
well, we-we had to go back because i forget my jacket.
that is right.
you-you are not wearing a jacket.
oh man! i did it again!
(standing up) okay, so umm, somebody has to call frank and alice. (as she is talking joey is sticking the camera under her skirt.) and then my mom wants to know-(notices joey)-joey, what are you doing?!
i got to get the before shot!
hi, pheebs? okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she is not coming.
what?!
apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
oh my god, she is so stupid!
look, pheebs-pheebs, it is going to be okay.
that is easy for you to say, i do not see three kids coming out your vagina!
honey, listen, y'know what? the nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
yeah, he is head of the department.
all right—ooh! oh dead god, save me!
what?
I am having my first contraction!
oh no.
ooh, it is not bad.
okay.
oh! (in an announcer type voice) and so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! (he grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)
hey! you okay?
ooh, something hurts!
ooh, it is sympathy pains. ohh, that is so sweet!
are they? i did not know i cared that much.
hello.
did he just say, he loves fonzie?
that is what it sounded like.
all right…
no-no-no! we have not started yet. where is alice?
yeah, that is when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
(entering) monica? you going to be very proud of me. i just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
oh my!
they are male nurses.
not in my head.
anyway, they want to take us out saturday night! what do you say?
umm. (looks at chandler who is using the phone.) umm. umm. i do not think so.
what? what are you talking about?! you-you are the one who is been telling me to get over ross and move on. I am moving on, and you are moving on with me. come on, give me one good reason why you do not want to go.
umm, why do not you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I will tell you if it is true.
what?
harder than it sounds. is not it?
okay, you are coming with me, and i also told them that if we are still here when they get off that we will go down to the cafeteria and have some jell-of with them.
(in a sexy voice) yep! there is always room for jell-of…
joey, how do you make that dirty?
oh, it is easy. yeah, i-i can do it with anything. watch uh, (snaps his fingers and in a sexy voice) grandma's chicken salad…
(entering) ross! get a shot of this. (he is carrying an issue of the usa today and hands ross the camera.) hey babies! these are the headlines on the day you were born! okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies… (throws the paper away to reveal a copy of playpen, which is the tv version of playboy magazine.) check it out, huh?! this is what naked women looked like the month you were born. all right, now let us dive right into the good stuff. (joey opens the magazine and ross sticks the camera in it.)
oh, okay, I am having another one! this one does not hurt either—ooh, yes it does! ow! ow! ow! ow! ooh! (checks under the blanket.) oh, i was kind of hoping that was it.
hey, where are monica and rachel anyway?
oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. maybe they are with them.
really? male nurses?
yeah, i was bummed too.
so they are going on dates? when?
i think saturday—(groans in pain again).
umm, sympathy pains. i thought it was really sweet at first, but now i think he is just trying to steal my thunder.
hey.
this-this fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
all right.
it is very weird! i do not want some guy down there telling me, I am y'know, dilatedamundo!
to be fair, he does not seem to be impersonating fonzie…
(interrupting) what are you doing?!! why are you defending him?! just get me another doctor! one who is not crazy and who is not fonzie!
again, it is not that he…
(spotting her) oh-hey-hey-hey! there you are!
umm, listen there is something i think you should know.
oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? yeah, joey already told me, and i am so-so fine. i mean, you and i we are just, y'know, we are nothing, we are goofin' around.
umm, actually i was about to tell you that i was, i was going to get out of it, but hey, if we are just goofing around then uh, maybe i will go out with him.
fine! maybe i will too!
(entering from the elevator caring gifts for the kids) hey, you guys! look what i found in the giiiiiiift shop. (he doubles over in pain in front an old man in a wheel chair.) get up! get up! get up! (the old man waves him away.)
okay, phoebe, this dr. oberman. he has no strong feelings about fonzie or any of the happy days gang.
hi! and you are going into what grade?
(interrupting) uh-huh, me too. ross, maybe i should have specified that I would be needing a grown up doctor.
shh! doogie, shh! does not anybody understand that I am going to be having babies soon? huh? go! go little boy, go!
umm, well, what else could it be?
or?
they are. why?
happy birthday!
honey, y'know i just got to tell you, i think this is such a terrific thing you are having these babies for frank and alice.
i know, it is.
yeah!
can i tell you a little secret?
yeah!
i want to keep one. (giggles in excitement.)
ohh, I am going to be on the news!
okay, phoebe, honey, you got to be kidding. i mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
why not?! maybe i can, you do not know!
yes! yes! yes, i do! i do know! frank and alice are going to want to keep all of their children!
maybe not! y'know? seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they are y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. listen, i-i hate to miss an opportunity just because i did not ask! y'know?
phoebe, no! this is, this is insane.
oh, just ask him!
me?!
i can not ask him! do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! all I am saying is just talk to frank. okay? just, y'know, feel him out!
no! forget it! i am not going to ask frank to give you one of his kids!!
you are right.
tell him it is for you.
feeling a little better sweetie?
well, maybe a little. i wish you had not seen me throw up.
me too.
(entering) hey! i just heard. what is up?
(interrupting) whoa-whoa! no-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! okay? up, up is not an option—what is a urethra? (monica whispers what it is in his ear.) are you crazy?!
(to rachel) so did you ask him?
no, i have not had a chance to be alone with him yet.
well, I am kind of on a clock here.
y'know who i always liked? mork.
undo it. undo it. undo it.
yeah, but umm… yes, but, fonzie was already cool, so he was not hurt, right?
(entering with chandler) hey!
hi!
(to phoebe) how are you doing?
okay, doctor says any minute now.
sorry frank, I am kind of in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
hi!
monica, this is dan (points to him), one of the guys that we are going to be going out with on saturday. (mouths "he is yours." to her.) uh dan, monica.
hello dan! I am really looking forward to saturday night! really, really!
so dan, nurse not a doctor huh? kind of girlie is not it?
chandler!
oh.
sure. (pause) and listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (retreats in defeat.)
so, why wait 'til saturday, are you free tomorrow?
oh, great!
(to another female nurse) hey, how 'bout it? you, me, saturday night?
all right. very good.
oo, this is a big one. eww! arghhhh!!
ohh, get these things out of me!
breathe! breathe! breathe throw the pain.
i want the drugs ross, i want the drugs! (he starts rocking back and forth, taking ross with him.)
i do too! i do too!
argh!
argh!
argh!
argh!
hi!
oh, honey, do not worry. she is going to make it on time.
yeah. so frank, three babies. whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
yeah, fair enough.
bye dan!
bye, momi-moo.
what is that?
oh my god!
yes!
oh, how does he look? how does he look?
i already had a baby. leave me alone.
oh god, kindergarten flashback.
okay, keep saying it!
oh my god.
you did it, man.
they are so small! (both he and ross look at them with satisfied looks on their faces.)
great!
so, are you really going to go out with that nurse man?
well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not goof around with him.
y'know, i do not know if you have ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am so bad at this.
i think you are better than you think you are.
really? okay, so…
(interrupting) know when to stop.
y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we are okay?
yeah. all right, I am going to go tell dan that it is not going to happen. (they kiss and as she starts to leave, chandler starts to dance. without turning around.) do not do the dance.
right!
i think you are my favorite.
which one do you have?
i do not care.
(entering) hi. (to phoebe) hey, hi! so uh, frank and alice wanted me to tell you that they are still outside making phone calls.
but umm, i mean, did you talk to them about, y'know…
yeah, umm, no honey.
oh. it was a long shot. hey, you guys can i just like have a second alone with the babies.
so, here you are. it seems like yesterday i was talking to you in that little petri dish. everyone said labor was the hardest thing I would ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. oh, i had the most fun with you guys! i wish i could take you home and see you everyday. okay, I will settle for being your favorite aunt. i know alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. okay, so we are cool. yeah, we are going to be great. little high fives! (imitates the high fives.) ahh! ahh! ahh! (one of the babies begins to cry.) well, if you are going to cry. (she starts crying.)
phoebe, we are so proud of you! you are amazing!
i know.
so does it really hurt as bad as they say?
yeah. you will not be able to take it.
so uh, now that little chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they going to name her?
they are going to call her chandler.
that is kind of a masculine name, do not you think?
works on you.
okay, she is the star of the play. and she is my girlfriend! i get to have sex with the star of the play!
people can hear you.
i know!!
wow! she looks great. does not she?
yeah.
that is one good looking man!
is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
dude!
here is your girlfriend’s button. (holding the button.)
oh, hey, mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
yeah, i think i have some around here somewhere. why?
well, it is just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
hey, rach! i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. if you could just…(rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it.
bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (phoebe gasps)
oh my god, are you out of a job?
no, but they stuck me in personal shopping. which is just a huge step down!
personal shopping? what is that? like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
uh-huh.
that sounds great!
(entering) hey! (goes to the fridge.)
umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. you can not eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
(holding a turkey leg) there is gravy?
if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. that fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that is your department now. (she takes back the turkey leg)
what are you doing?
i think i left a donut up here.
hey!
hey!
hey!
ooh! how was kathy’s play?
well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.
yeah, it is like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
that is a good idea for a business!
I am totally screwed. okay, they are going to be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they are going to go to their cast parties and he is going to try to undermine me. y'know it will be like, "so where is your boyfriend, what is-his-name, chester?" and she will go, "no-no-no, it is chandler." and he will go, "whatever. ha-ha-ha-ha!"
(to ross) that-that is a good trick.
all right, look, look, what am i going to do?
chandler, look they are actors. they are there to do a job, just ‘because they work together, does not mean they are going to get together. i mean just ‘because it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins, it does not mean it is going to happen with them.
oh-oh, alec baldwin and kim basinger.
tom cruise and nicole kidman.
yeah.
hey, mel gibson and clint eastwood.
they are not a couple!
oh-okay, i get the game now.
okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
oh yeah!
well okay, so then you are fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as it is hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. it is when the heat goes away, that is when you are in trouble.
really?
look, you guys have been to every play I have ever been in, have i ever had chemistry on stage?
no.
noooo!!
so uh, man, are you going to go to the play with me tonight?
y’know what, i do not know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
yeah, i know but…
oh no-no-no, I am there.
(entering) hey!
hey mon! want some pancakes?
you made pancakes?
yep! grab a plate.
okay. (she does so and starts to walk towards joey to receive her pancakes.)
no-no, stay right there. (monica stops and joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) gettin’ closer.
okay, okay, but do not worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which I am fairly certain are the same thing.
listen also we are uh, we are watching the game here saturday night, if people want to come over.
oh yeah!
oh, i was thinking about having people over for the game.
oh yeah, who is playing?
the players.
somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
(laughs) please, it is a relief is what it is, is what it is.
all right pheebs, stick out your plate!
oh. (joey flips the pancake and phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)
(on the phone) monica, I am quitting! i just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she did not even buy it! (pause) I am telling you I am quitting! that is it! I am talking to my boss right now! (pause) yes i am! (pause) yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! okay bye, call me when you get this message. (hangs up as her boss, mr. waltham, walks in.) oh! mr. waltham, i ah really need to talk to you.
hi!
hi, I am rachel green. what can i do for you joshua?
oh, I am so sorry.
well, at least that is a great suit.
okay.
no-no, that was not me! (to joshua) well, we should get started. let me show you my underwear. (joshua turns at that) the selection of underwear we carry.
oh-oh, sorry, it is this way, it is this way. (motions to the correct way.)
I am right! right? there was like no chemistry between them. before they had heat, and now there is no heat! now you know what this means, joey told us what this means!
all right, let us not jump to any conclusions. all right? there was some sexual chemistry between them.
come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
here she comes. do not say a word, okay? just be cool, do not be…y'know you.
hey!
oh, absolutely! (chandler mumbles something.)
oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly you are having sex with him.
okay, i… (walks away.)
oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!
y’know, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know you are up there every night, you are naked, touching, kissing.
well, you can understand, given how we started.
well, that is what happened, and i do not even see you denying this!
yeah, well, do not expect that to happen anytime soon!
i have the best job in the entire world! the most adorable guy came over today, and i got to dress him up all day!
rachel has a new doll.
oh, i wish he was a doll, then i could get a rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. oh! and he has the most beautiful name, i never realised it, joshua! josh-you-a! joshua! josh.
uh, hello!
hi-e!!
ooh, what do i smell?
i do not know, it smells good.
fresh cookies! hot from the oven!
ooh! (they all go over to her apartment)
please, have some!
oh, yumm!
yeah, I have just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
(holding a magazine) wow! the new playboy!
yeah, it is just something i picked up.
cookies and porn, you are the best mom ever!!
what? what?
well, it was just something josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
yeah, how does jason look in a v-neck?
it is joshua.
oh, whatever. (laughs and gives joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. joey follows him)
wait! wait! this is not take-out!
(getting up) well, i hate to eat and run, but…
no, wait, please do not go! I have got porn for you too!
yeah, i do not need it.
people are supposed to want to hang out here!
why? honey, what is the big deal?
I am the hostess! not those guys! I am always the hostess! i mean, i was always the hostess, i mean even when i was little, i mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, i-i served the best air.
well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
‘because they took our apartment, i wanted to punish them. but I am-I am done now. they have suffered enough.
if you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here!
yeah, that is true.
all right then, when I am done with this place, it is going to be ten times better than that place!
oh, are we going to trash that place?
steps! (he opens the door to his apartment to ross and joey looking at the new playboy) slut! (ross and joey quickly hide the playboy behind their backs. chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy!
so you were right?
i confronted her, and she did not deny it! (pause) i do not live here! (goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
chandler!
chandler, what did she say?
wait a minute.
come here.
are you sure?
well, i may be drunk, but i know what she said! then i went over to beefsteak julie’s…
beefsteak charlie’s?
yes! see you and i have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)
whoops. (starts to go into chandler and joey’s.) oh, hey, do you need help with that?
nah, i got it.
ooh, i just feel bad, i never vacuum. (she goes into chandler and joey’s.)
hi!
so i was with joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. it is just so frustrating!
why do not you ask him out?
oh, yeah, totally! that is such a turn-on!
really? it does not seem desperate?
oh-ooh, that is the turn-on.
he just got a divorce right?
hmm-mmm.
so he is probably really nervous around women, y'know? maybe, you just have to make the first move.
yeah but, I have never asked a guy out before.
(shocked) you have never asked a guy out?!!
no. have you?
thousands of times!! that does not make me sound too good does it?
i do not even know how i would go about it.
oh-oh-oh-oh, how i do it is, i look a woman up and down and say, "hey, how you doing?"
oh, please!
(to phoebe) hey, how you doing?
you know what, I am going to do that, I am going to call him up, and I am going to ask him out. i can do that. ask him out. (practising) how you doing? (calls him) hi! joshua? it is rachel green from bloomingdale’s. (listens) yeah, umm, i was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? well, we found a wallet, and we—(listens) the license? well, that is a good idea! uh, well, let us see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I will see you tomorrow. bye. (hangs up) (to phoebe) you have done that a thousand times?
I have never done that.
ohh, god, i just got so nervous that he would say no.
well, you got to give him something that he can not say no too. like uh, knicks tickets! invite the guy to a knicks game, you are guaranteed he will say yes!
really?! you think that will work?
absolutely! and if it does not, can i get the extra ticket?
what the heck is that?
did she call?
no, sorry.
all right, maybe i should call her.
no! forget her, man! you do not need her, you do not need that!
he is right, what she did was unforgivable.
well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if i was wrong?
how might you be wrong?
well y'know, what if she did not actually sleep with the guy?
dude, tell me she actually told you this.
she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. back me up here, ross!
that is all you are basing this on?
that is not backing me up! look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! there is a lot of theories that did not pan out. the lone gunman. communism. geometry.
oh my god!!
would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (tries again.) you know, its funny, basketball, because i happen to have tickets too… (tries again.) umm, who likes the knicks—(joshua comes in from the dressing room.)
oh! well, as a single woman, who is available, i think you look great!
yep. oh, yeah, look you great. (she puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) oh yeah. yeah, this looks great. (pause) umm, so you like it?
great.
sure.
yeah-eah-ha!
oh well, you do not want to do that now?!
okay.
basketball!
i uh, i have two tickets to the knicks game tonight if you are interested, just as a thank you for this week.
really?
hey. i just, i just wanted to come over to-to say that I am sorry. y’know? i know i acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and i can completely understand why you were so upset.
yeah, i know, i-i wish i had too, but y’know i-i think this is a good thing. y'know? ‘because we have had our first fight, and now we can move on. y’know, i know for me—(notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) nick’s pants?
yeah. well, i think our second fight is going to be a big one!
okay, for next time, what do you say?
i have an extra ticket. an extra ticket. not, two tickets, i have an extra ticket.
so the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
he did not turn me down! he is at the game is not he? i got the date, I am just not on it!
(entering) okay, it is ready. come on.
what is ready?
just come.
oh my god!
wow! monica!
great!
this is beautiful!
oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?
pretty much. (to joey) so, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
i do not know, it looks the same.
you used to have carpet.
oh yeah!
so i made snacks. please, just hang out okay? I am just going to rest my eyes just a little bit.
look, mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I am always the hostess.
hey!
how did it go?
well, she was not sleeping with him.
oh good!
she is now.
what are you saying?
I am saying that she… is a devil woman! y’know i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick! nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! i hate him, i hate her! well, i do not hate her, i love her. this is all my fault really.
how? how is your fault?
because, i-i should have called! y’know if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would have gone out with nick, and they would have ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples!
honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
well, if-if she thought they were on a break…
really?
yes! i will! absolutely! (she takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. she then proceeds to act like dark helmut in spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) hello, rachel. hi, joshua. i left my wallet here on purpose. really? yes, i just wanted to see you again. oh, I am glad. rachel, I would like to say something to you. yes? how you doing?
(angrily) that is like the tenth time I have peed since I have been here!
that is also like the tenth time you told us.
yeah, oh I am sorry, it must be really hard to hear! i tell ya, it is a lot easier having three babies play bringing in the noise, bringing in da funk on your bladder! I am so sick of being pregnant! the only happiness i get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘because—oh! I am pregnant!
pheebs, did…you want a cookie?
(starting to cry) thank you so much.
so uh, pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
i have not really had any yet.
hey guys!
hey.
hey!
all right, here is the ring. (shows chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving emily)
(shocked) yes! yes! a thousand times, yes!
so uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
whoa-whoa-whoa! before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, do not you have to decide who your best man is going to be?
oh, it is awkward. it is awkward. it is awkward.
i sort’ve already asked chandler.
what?! he got to do it at your first wedding!
joey, i figured you would understand. i mean, i-I have known him a lot longer.
come on ross! look, i-i do not have any brothers; I will never get to be a best man!
you can be the best man when i get married.
(pause) I will never get to be a best man!
(to chandler) wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and i never get to be yours at all?
oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
(impatiently tapping chandler on the shoulder) what about me?! you-you just said i could!
I am not even getting married! okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!
i can not believe you are not picking me.
hey, how can it not be me?!heyhey!
I am not even… I am not even…
fine, y’know what, that is it. from now on, joey, i want you to be my best man.
yes! (to chandler) shame about you man.
(to her babies) stop it!
what?
one of the babies is kicking.
i thought that was a good thing.
it is not kicking me, it is kicking one of the other babies. oh (looks down her dress)! do not make me come in there!
(entering) hey!
hey!
do you guys have like a big bowl i can borrow?
yeah, there is one right under the cabinet.
(grabs it) thanks.
why do you need it?
oh, we are having a big party tomorrow night. later! (starts for the door.)
whoa! hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?
nooo, later. (walks out the door.)
hey!! get your ass back here, tribbiani!! (joey walks back in, scared.)
hormones!
what phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you are having a party and we are not invited?
oh, it is ross’s bachelor party.
sooo?
are you bachelors?
nooo!
are you strippers?
nooo!
then you are not invited. (starts for the door again.)
all right fine! you are not invited to the party we are going to have either.
oh-whoa, what party?
well umm…
the baby shower for phoebe!
baby shower. wow! that sounds sooo like something i do not want to do! later! (finally, he makes his exit.)
i can not believe I am going to have a party! this is so great! (really excited) a party! (really, really excited) yay!! (suddenly, she starts crying and rachel moves to comfort her.) i do not know why.
this is what I have got going for the party so far, liquor wise. get a lot of liquor.
great. great.
okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I have got you, me, and chandler and I am going to invite gunther ‘because, well, we have been talking about this pretty loud.
all right—oh! listen, i know this is your party, but I would really like to the number of museum geeks that are going to be there.
yeah. tell ya what, let us not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
okay! we will need a six-pack of zima.
(entering) hey guys, what are you doing?
oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
yeah, see, i do not think it is going to that difficult considering this one will not be taking place in the basement of a pizza hut.
oh, I am ross. I am ross. I am too good for the hut; I am too good for the hut.
look, i got to go pick up ben. everything so far sounds great joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
you got it.
okay, see ya later.
see ya. (ross exits, and chandler moves over next to joey, laughing.) have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
well, there is going to be strippers there. he did not say anything about no strippers.
he just said, "no strippers."
oh, i chose not to hear that.
look what i got! look what i got! look what i got! (she shows rachel what she bought. she bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the babies.) can you believe they make these for little people?
little village people.
okay, look at this one. this is my favourite. (it is a little pink and white dress for the girl baby.)
oh, that is so sweet!
i know! phoebe is going to love dressing them in these!
huh. except, phoebe’s not going to be the one that gets to dress them.
because she is not going to get to keep the babies.
oh my god! we are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
wait a minute! unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she is done being pregnant. like-like umm, regular coffee, tequila.
oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she is always wanted!
oh, she is going to love that!
what the hell is this?! what, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that i can not use for another two months?! this sucks! all right, what is my next present?!
hey listen man, about the stripper…
yeah?
good call!
(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I have decided that my best man is, my best friend gunther!
central perk?
oh-whoa-wait, gunther do not-do not forget your shirt. (he gives gunther his shirt and gunther leaves.)
hey-hey, what are those?
oh, little party favours, check it out! (it is a shirt that reads, "ross geller, bachelor bash 1998")
wow! yeah!
oh-oh! (shows him what is on the back, "best man joey tribbiani, with a huge picture of him.)
(banging on the bottle again) okay, okay, a little announcement, i just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! and uh, (to the stripper) so is the position of the bride.
smooth man. yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (chandler checks and runs into the bathroom.) well, i just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. and hey! see you guys monday morning. (they museum geeks wave at him.) thanks joey.
oh, hey, do not forget your shirt.
oh, thanks! (takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. okay. wave bye-bye to the nice lady. there you go. back to your parent’s basement. all right. (the museum geeks exit and joey unlocks his door and let us the chick and the duck out.) come on boys, come on out! here you go. all right.
yeah!
oh yeah-yeah. and i got the duck totally trained. watch this. stare at the wall. (the duck complies.) hardly move. (the duck complies.) be white. (the duck complies.)
oh thanks. thanks. it was great meetin’ ya. and listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a tuesday…
oh unless you uh, you want to hang around.
yeah. I will let you play with my duck.
hey, (realises he does not know her name.) stripper! (he notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees it is empty and starts to panic.)
(running and banging on chandler’s door) the stripper stole the ring!! the stripper stole the ring!! chandler! chandler, get up! get up! the stripper stole the ring!
(opening the door) what?
the ring is gone!
ugh. just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—ah-ha-ha!! you lost the ring! you are the worst best man ever!
dude, this is not funny! what am i going to do?! i go to bed last night, everything’s cool! i wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!
you slept with the stripper?
of course!! (shrugs.)
hi, guys.
hi! phoebe. (both monica and her try to move out of phoebe’s way.)
hi phoebe.
i-i wanted to apologise if i—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. y’know it is just the hormones, y’know.
no we…
hormones.
…hormones, yeah.
anyway, i just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (she goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that phoebe is about to attack them.)
wow, you seem to be doing so much better. that is great. so how-how are things going?
good. y’know—no-no, okay, it is-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what is happening with you?
oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to ross’s wedding.
oh!
it just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
wow! this reminds me of the time when i was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him.
well, h-how is this like that?
well, let us see, it is not. really, like that. because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
(starting to cry) I am-I am sorry, i just thought that…
alrighty, here come the water works. (rachel starts crying harder.)
ugh! i do not know what I am going to do! i called the company that sent and th-they do not care! then i called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this is not an emergency, then what is?
(entering) hey guys!
hey!
hey…
i just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! and the guys from work had a blast. y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. yeah! and-and another one had never been to a party before, so…
so uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? man, that is nice!
yeah, right!
i was uh, i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, i might want to get one of those…
that ring? when my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
so you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (gives joey a little squeeze.)
oh absolutely! it has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
so you might say, it is a magic ring.
(laughs, softly) yeah, the stripper stole it.
my-my ring? my-my wedding ring? the-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! h-how?! how could this all happen?!
well, i think it all started when you said, "hey joey, why do not you be my best man."
(dialling the phone) all right-all right, fine! i-I am going to call the cops!
dude, i screwed up, you do not have to turn me in!
not on you! on the stripper!
oh, yeah, well i already did that! they said they are going to look into it right after they solved all the murders.
okay, well, we will call the company that sent her!
i did that too! they would not give me her real name or her number. they said, "if i bothered them again they would call the police." i said, "if you talk to the police, you tell them I am missing a ring!"
so what, joey? wh-wh-what? what are you telling me? that there is nothing we can do? well, how could this happen?!
look ross, i am so-so sorry. i-i-i…
well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
oh, that sounds like fun, but we have got a ring to find!!
here is your tea phoebe. (they give it to her and quickly take a step back.)
(sips it) it is so good. (monica and rachel breath a sigh of relief.) oh, thanks.
good.
I am so glad you liked it.
(sets the cup down) oh! (grabs her stomach in pain.)
what?!
what?! she made the tea! (points to monica.)
oh! no, i-i think i just had a contraction.
you what?
oh my god!
yeah, i thought i had one a couple of minutes ago, and now i know that was definitely one.
wait, you can not have the baby here! i mean i have not sterilised it since the guys moved out!
okay. it is okay. we are going to be okay. y’know what? it is okay. I am going to, I am going to, I am going to boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
no. it is all right; it is probably false labour. they said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
rachel, get the book! the book!
okay! (runs and grabs a book and hands it to monica.) okay! here!
the bible?!
i do not know!
all right, okay, this is great, uh, chandler, you get behind the desk. and-and when she comes in hopefully, she will not recognise you because, well, why would she? uh, okay, and then you buzz ross and i. (to ross) you be mr. gonzalez, and I will be uh, mr. wong.
diverse.
(to ross) you be cool. (he opens the door and let us her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
where is my ring? my dead grandmother’s wedding ring? where is it? where is it?
way to be cool, man.
there was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
we know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
marry me. (both ross and chandler hit him.)
i do not get it! it was in my room all night! and if she did not take it, and i did not take it; and you (chandler) did not take it, then who did? (the duck quacks.) shh! we are trying to think! (ross and chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at joey, who does not get it. after a short pause, with the duck still quacking, joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)
i still do not get how you know when it is false labour.
well, do you see any babies?
how do you feel?
okay, i guess. i mean… i do not know, it is just, i guess i know it is going to be over soon.
well, is not that a good thing? you said you were sick of this.
i know. it is just y’know usually when you are, when you are done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I am going to be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
some moms do that.
okay that is even sadder. look, i know, i know what i got myself into, it is just that now that they are in me it is like, it is like i know them y’know, i mean-i mean, it is just not going to be easy when these little babies have to go away.
aww, sweetie, but it is not like you are not going to have anything. you are going to have nieces and nephews, and some ways that is even better.
yeah, okay.
no, really. really, pheebs, you are not going to be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they are bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on ritalin when they just will not calm down. y’know?
i mean, you are the one they are going to come to when they want to run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
and you just get to be cool aunt phoebe!
cool aunt phoebe. i am pretty cool!
yeah.
and y’know what else, oh my god, are they going to love you.
they are going to love me.
oh!
thanks you guys! again.
oh, sweetie! (they all hug.)
you are the best. thanks. oh!
just kidding. ahh!
what?!
oh my god!
got cha again, you guys are so easy.
if anything should happen to him…
joey! the vet said it is a simple procedure.
so! things can go wrong! you do not know! what if he does not make it?!
he will, joe.
yeah, but what if he does not? he is such a good duck.
I am so worried about him, y’know?
oh my god! thank you! thank you so much! (he grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where it is been.)
h-h-h-how is the duck?
ohh, great! oh hey, listen ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
no, that is all right.
no, it is not. i mean you-you made me your best man and i totally let you down!
hey, come on, it is not your fault.
yeah, it is! you would not have lost the ring, right? y’know what, ross you were right from the start, he (chandler) should be your best man.
no, you should.
now, do not argue with me…
hey! hey! hey! i get to choose my best man, and i want both you guys.
really?
really?
hey, both you guys should be up there with me. i mean, you two are-are my… i mean, I am lucky to have just one good… (they all start getting emotional.)
thanks man.
(starting to cry) i got to go check something over here. (he walks away so that they can not see him cry.)
what a baby.
total wuss!
i ross...
take thee, rachel...(all his friends have looks of shock on their faces. he realizes what he said. quickly he says.) emily. (a slight chuckle.) emily.
(to the woman sitting in front of her) he-he said rachel, right? do you think i should go up there?
i, ross…
take thee, (glares at the minister) emily. (chuckles) like there would be anybody else. (emily is glaring at him.)
as my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. really, i do. emily. (points at her.)
happy too.
yay!
okay.
well, that went well. yeah.
it could have been worse, he could have shot her.
(laughs) that uh, that was pretty funny. was not it?
(to the gang) hey, no matter what happens with ross and emily, we still get cake right?
(exiting the bathroom) that-that-that is all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I will be right out here. (she slams the door in his face, to the gang) she is just fixing her makeup.
and, i love you!! (he walks into the living room)
that is true, thanks dad. (to all) people should be dancing! huh? hey, this is a party! come on! joey, dance!! (he starts to dance but stops when no one else joins him.)
(on the phone, in new york) uh, hello, this is ross geller’s personal physician, dr. philange.
yeah, I have discovered that ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
no, not phoebe, dr. philange. oh no! you have it too!
hello?
hey.
hey.
oh wow, i hope you do not take this the wrong way but, i know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I am just kind of worried about what it might do to our friendship.
i know. how could we have let this happen?
seven times!
ugh! well, y’know, we were away…
in a foreign, romantic country…
i blame london.
bad london! (takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
so look umm, while we are st-still in london, i mean, we can keep doing it right?
well, i do not see that we have a choice. but, when we are back home, we do not do it.
only here.
y’know, i saw a wine cellar downstairs…
I will meet you there in two minutes.
okay!
mon, honey, i got to ask you something.
(impatiently) now?
ross said my name up there, i mean, come on, i just can not pretend that did not happen can i?
oh, i-i do not know.
monica, what should i do?
just uh, do the right thing. (uses some breath spray)
what?
toe the line. thread the needle. think outside the box! (tries to leave, but is stopped by rachel.)
whoa, wait, listen, i think I am just going to talk to ross about what he think it meant.
wait. rachel, no, he is married. married! if you do not realize that, i can not help you.
okay, you are right. you are right. you can not help me.
hey, what is up? (he has solved the problem of eating the steak, he is eating it with his hands.)
where were you? we were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
forget it, that is off.
why?!
joey, what are you doing? you promised phoebe you would not eat meat until she has the babies!
well, i figured we are in another country, so it does not count.
that is true.
the man’s got a point.
oh, hi!
hi!
hi. sorry, things are not working out so well.
oh no! it could be better, but it is going to be okay, right?
oh yeah! of course, i mean, she is going to get over this, y’know? i mean, so you said my name! y’know you just said it ‘because you saw me there, if you would have seen a circus freak, you would have said, "i take thee circus freak." y’know, it did not mean anything, it is just a mistake. it did not mean anything. right?
no! no! of course it did not mean anything! i mean, uh well, i can understand why emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
right…
but it absolutely did not. (yelling towards the bathroom) it did not!! it did not!!
(approaching) ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with emily, so…
(sarcastic) oh! oh-oh, the band’s ready! well, i-i-we got to do what the band says—i do not care about the stupid band!!
you spit on me man! (wipes his face.)
look, I am sorry.
emily is kind of taking a long time, huh?
(laughs) y’know when i locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because i was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
oh, right!
get the hell out of there, y’know?
(bangs on the bathroom door) emily? emily? I am coming in. (he opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with emily.)
well, look at that, same thing.
listen, in the middle of everything if i scream the word, "yippee!" just ignore me.
oh my god, rachel! hi!
oh, hello rachel.
ross said my name. okay? my name. ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! (they both just stare at her.) okay, do not believe me, i know I am right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
yes, we do. but, we have to change first.
yes, i want to change. and why-why do not you go down and get us a table?
yeah, we will be down in like five minutes.
(elbows him) fifteen minutes.
okay.
hello? oh, pheebs! (to them) it is phoebe!
oh, yay…
great…
hi!
hi, so what happened?
well, ross said my name.
yeah, i know, but i do not think that means anything.
okay, pheebs, y’know what, let us look at this objectively all right? ninth grade, right? the obsession starts. all right? the summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. so then…
(to monica) hey, listen, why do not we go change in my room?
but my clothes are—ohh! (they both leave.)
wow, you look…
no time for that!
hey, dude, let me in. i got a girl out here!
well, I have got a girl in here.
no you do not, i just saw you go in there with monica!
well, we are-we are hanging out in here!
look, which one of us is going to be having sex in there, me or you?
well, i suppose I would have to say you!! but, what if we are watching a movie in here?
which we are, and-and we already paid for it. it is my giant!
my giant? i love that movie!
you really think this is okay?
well, ross and emily are not going to use it.
oh, it is so beautiful. ohh! y’know, i-i do not know if i feel right about this.
oh mon-mon-mon-mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. the room expects sex. the room would be disappointed if it did not get sex. all of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
okay!
okay!
(entering) emily?!
nope, not under here!
you did not find her?
no, I have looked everywhere!
well, you could not have looked everywhere or else you would have found her!
yeah, i think you should keep looking!
yeah, for about 30 minutes.
or 45.
wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (monica smiles at that.)
no! for all i know, she is trying to find me but could not because i kept moving around. no, from now on, I am staying in one place. (he sits down on the bed.) right here.
well, it is getting late.
yeah, we are going to go.
actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
ugh, y’know, umm we got to get up early and catch that plane for new york.
yeah, it is a very large plane.
(disappointed) that is cool.
but, we will stay here with you.
thanks guys! (they both sit down on either side of him.) i really appreciate this, y’know, but you do not have to rub my butt.
we have to leave for new york in an hour.
i know, I have been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, do not you think?
we can not do that that is insane. i mean ‘a’ he could wake up and ‘b’ y’know, let us go for it.
them-emily? (looking around for her.) them-emily? (he runs to the door.) emily! (he opens the door to reveal the walthams standing outside.)
wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
(entering, carrying an armful of those little soaps.) hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there is a whole cart outside… (sees the walthams and stops.)
now, hold on! hold on! (stops him) look, look, your daughter and i are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I am going to be at that airport and i hope that she will be there too! oh yeah, i said rachel’s name, but it did not mean anything, okay? she is-she is just a friend and that is all! (rachel sits down, depressed.) that is all! now just tell emily that i love her and that i can not imagine spending my life with anyone else. please, promise me that you will tell her that.
y’know, maybe it is best that we never got to do it again.
yeah, it kind of makes that-that one night special. (realizes something) y’know, technically we still are over international waters.
I am going to go to the bathroom, maybe I will see you there in a bit?
‘kay!
can i ask you something?
uhh, no.
felicity and i, we are watching my giant, and i was thinking, "I am never going to be as good an actor as that giant." do you think I am just wasting my life with this acting thing?
no.
i mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I will ever get there?
yes.
thanks man.
okay man. (chandler starts to get up.)
but what about how much taller he is than me?
i mean, there is no way i can make myself taller now, y’know? and who knows what science will come up with in the future, but chandler, what if i die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
hey, monica, wow you have been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
i know!
had the beef-tips, huh?
hey!
hey!
hi!
(to joey) you ate meat! (joey is shocked) (to chandler and monica) you had sex! (they are shocked.)
no we did not!
i know you did not, i was talking about monica.
phoebe, i did not have sex.
this pregnancy is throwing me all off.
all right, I am going to go say hi the chick and the duck.
oh, me too!
why would you need to say hi to them, you have been feeding them for four days?
oh right, maybe I will just go home.
well, we certainly are alone.
yes! good thing we have that, ‘not in new york’ rule.
right. umm, listen since we are-we-re on that subject, umm, i just wanted to tell you that uh, well, i-i was going through a really hard time in london, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking i was ross’s mother…
right.
well, an-anyway, i just—that night meant a lot to me, i guess I am just trying to say thanks.
oh. y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it was not because i was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘because, you are really hot! is that okay?
(laughs) that is okay.
and I am cute too.
and you are cute too.
thank you! (they hug.) all right, i got to go unpack.
okay.
bye.
(entering) I am still on london time, does that count?
that counts!
oh, good! (they start kissing.)
rach! rach!
(she stops and turns) hi!
hi! what are you, what are you doing here?
well, i-i-I have been on standby for a flight home for hours.
oh.
ohh, so no sign of emily huh?
not yet.
so umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
pretty soon i guess.
yeah. I am sorry.
i just, i do not understand, i mean, how-how can she do this? y’know, what, am i, am i like a complete idiot for thinking that she would actually show up?
no, you are not an idiot, ross. you are a guy very much in love.
same difference.
i get it! well, that is that.
no, you know what, i think you should go.
what?
yeah, i do. i think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, i think it would be really good.
oh, i do not, i do not, i do not know…
oh, come on ross! i think it would be really good for you!
i could, yeah, i can do that.
yeah.
i can not, i can not even believe her! no, y’know what, i am, i am going to go!
good!
i know, why not?
right!
right?
right!
y’know—thanks! (they hug)
okay, I will see you back at home, if i ever get a flight out of here.
yeah, well…nah.
what? wait, what?
why do not you come, i mean, i-i have two tickets, why not?
well-well, i do not know ross—really?
yeah, yeah, it will be great! you can, you can lay on the beach and i can cry over my failed marriage. see-see how i make jokes?
uh-huh.
no really, i mean, i mean, god, i could use a friend.
oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. umm, yes, i can do that!
okay!
okay!
cool!
all right!
come on! (they go to the jetway, ross hands the tickets to the gate agent.) here.
oh, okay, we are going. yeah.
ah! ah! i forgot my jacket!
oh, wait-wait-wait…
you tell them to wait!
okay. wait! wait!
emily.
oh no-no-no! oh-no! (emily starts to run out and ross chases her.) no! no! emily!
ahh, yes, i will have a glass of the merlot and uh, (points to ross’s seat.) he will have a white wine spritzer. woo! (looks out the window.) hey, look at that, the airport’s moving. (realizes that that is not how it works.) hey, are we moving?! are we moving? why are we moving? hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we are moving? (sits back in defeat.) oh my god. oh, my gosh.
(to joey) coffee. (hands it to him.)
thank you.
(to ross) cappuccino. (hands it to him.)
grazie.
and a nice hot cider for monica. (hands it to her.)
aww, thank you. (notices something.) uh rach?
yeah?
why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
oh! that is why. (rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I am sorry!
mrs. tedlock. you are looking lovely today. and may i say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
oh, listen. if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them. really. nothing at all. really. (chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) nothing.
hey you guys! chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
hey!
never mind. but it was going to be really good.
what is going on?
so, it is a typical day at work. I am inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
so.... i quit.
why? this was supposed to be a temp job!
yeah, chandler... you have been there for five years.
if i took this promotion, it would be like admitting that this is what i actually do.
so was it a lot more money?
it does not matter. i just do not want to be one of those guys that is in his office until twelve of the clock at night worrying about the wenus.
... the wenus?
weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term.
(sarcastic) oh. that wenus.
so what are you going to do?
i do not know. that is the thing. i do not know what i want to do. i just know I am not going to figure it out working there.
oooh! i have something you can do! i have this new massage client... steve? (pause) anyway, he is opening up a restaurant and he is looking for a head chef.
(taps phoebe on her shoulder) um... hi there.
hi! (turns back to chandler, then to monica) oh, yeah, no, i know. you are a chef. i know, and i thought of you first, but um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
yeah... i just do not have that much cheffing experience. unless it is an all-toast restaurant.
(to monica's tapping) yeah, yeah!
well, what kind of food is he looking for?
well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he is looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
(excited) oh my god!
yeah, i know! (turns to chandler) so, what do you think?
thanks, phoebe. but i just do not really see myself in a big white hat.
ok. (pause) oh monica! guess what!
can you see my nipples through this shirt?
no. but do not worry, I am sure they are still there.
where are you going, mr. suity-man?
well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) i added the "a-gogo."
career counselor?
hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
i do not!
hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. you know, you have goals. you have dreams. i do not have a dream.
ah, the lesser-known "i do not have a dream" speech.
oh, i love my life, i love my life!
ooh! brian's song!
the meeting with the guy went great?
so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it is this, it is this cute little place on 10th street. not too big, not too small. just right.
was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
so anyway, I am cooking dinner for him monday night. you know, kind of like an audition. and phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
what are you going to make?
(as though rachel was not paying attention) yummy noises.
(pause) and monica, what are you going to make?
i do not know. i do not know. it is just going to be so great!
ooh! i know what you could make! (runs over to join monica and rachel in the kitchen) i know! oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (monica does not know.) you know, that thing... with the stuff...? ok, i do not know. (sits down)
hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
how about tony's? if you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it is free.
ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you are not dating a puma?
who are you going out with?
oh, is this the bug lady?
(trying to sound like a bug) bzzzz.... i love you, ross.
her name is celia. she is not a bug lady. she is curator of insects at the museum.
so what are you guys going to do?
oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I would introduce her to my monkey.
and he is not speaking metaphorically.
(aside to ross) so.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
well, i do not know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I am hoping (gestures) huh-huh.
I am telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! she is going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it will seal the deal.
celia, do not worry!  do not scream!  he is not going to hurt you! soothing tones, celia. soothing tones! marcel...
alright... (lifts marcel away)
(to joey) ok, try this salmon mousse.
(tasting) mmmm. good.
is it better than the other salmon mousse?
it is creamier.
yeah, well, is that better?
i do not know. we are talking about whipped fish, monica. I am just happy I am keeping it down, y'know?
my god! what happened to you?
eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do i learn? (he taps the results and reads them) "you are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
that is so great! because you already know how to do that!
can you believe it? i mean, do not i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? you know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something.
(comes up and rubs him on the chest) oh chandler, i know, i know... oh, hey! you can see your nipples through this shirt!
(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so I would better split this with you.
it is supposed to be that small. it is a pre-appetizer. the french call it an amouz-bouche.
(tastes it) well.... it is amouz-ing...
(on phone) hello? (listens) oh, hi wendy! (listens) yeah, eight of the clock. (listens) what did we say? ten dollars an hour?... (listens) ok, great. (listens) all right, I will see you then. bye. (hangs up)
ten dollars an hour for what?
oh, i asked one of the waitresses at work if she would help me out.
(hurt) waitressing?
uh-oh.
well... of course i thought of you! but... but...
but, but?
but, you see, it is just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? and, well, wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
oh! i see. and I have sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that i can waitress in the olympics.
you know, i do not mean to brag, but i waited tables at innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
ok.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
(embarrassed) wha... what, here?
ah....
(panicked) er.... um.....
um... uh.... vulva.
(in disbelief) vulva?
alright, i panicked, alright? she took me by surprise. you know, but it was not a total loss. i mean, we ended up cuddling.
(sarcastic) whoaa!! you cuddled? how many times??
shut up! it was nice. i just... i do not think I am the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
what is the big deal? you just say what you want to do to her. or what you want her to do to you. or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I will tell you what. just try something on me.
(deadpan) please be kidding.
why not? come on! just, just close your eyes and tell me what you would like to be doing right now.
ok. (closes eyes) I am in my apartment...
....yeah... what else?
that is it. I am in my apartment, you are not there, we are not having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)
(walks to catch up to him) alright, look, I will start, ok?
joey, please.
come on. come on. alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) oh... ross.... you get me so hot. i want your lips on me now.
(impressed) wow.
alright, now you say something.
i... ahem... i really do not think so.
come on! you like this woman, right?
yeah.
you want to see her again, right?
sure.
well if you can not talk dirty to me, how are you going to talk dirty to her? now tell me you want to caress my butt!
ok, turn around. (joey looks taken aback) i just do not want you staring at me when I am doing this.
(turning around) alright, alright. I am around. go ahead.
ahem... i want.... ok, i want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
there you go! keep going. keep going!
i, er...
i want to take my tongue... and...
....and....
say it... say it!
...run it all over your body until you are... trembling with... with...
(smiling)....with??
(rushing to explain) funny story!
you are not going to believe this!
it is ok. it is ok. i was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
hey chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
again?
and again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) hello? (hands phone to chandler) and again.
(on phone) hey mr. kostelic! how is life on the fifteenth floor? (listens) yeah, i miss you too. (listens) yeah, it is a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (listens) well, that is very generous (listens) er, but look, this is not about the money. i need something that is more than a job. i need something i can really care about.... (listens) and that is on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (listens) look, al, al... I am not playing hardball here, ok? this is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (listens) no! no! no, stop saying numbers! I am telling you, you have got the wrong guy! you have got the wrong guy! (listens) I will see you on monday! (slams the phone down)
well?
(excited) wow! it is huge! it is so much bigger than the cubicle. oh, this is a cube.
look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of new york city)
oh! you have a window!
yes indeedy! (they look outside) with a beautiful view of...
oh look! that guy's peeing!
(walks away from window) ok, that is enough of the view. check this out, look at this. sit down, sit down.
(sitting) ok.
this is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) helen, could you come in here for a moment?
thank you helen, that will be all.
last time i do that, i promise.
(shouting on phone) wendy, we had a deal! (listens) yeah, you promised! wendy! wendy! wendy! (hangs up)

wendy bailed. i have no waitress.
oh... that is too bad. bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)

no.
twelve dollars an hour.
mon. i wish i could, but I have made plans to walk around.
you know, rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, i was there for you. i put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (rachel is not buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
done.
well hello! welcome to monica's. may i take your coat?
hi steve!
(to steve) this is rachel.
(overemphasizing) mmmmmm! everything smells so delicious! you know, i can not remember a time i smelt such a delicious combination of (monica signals her to stop) of, ok, smells.
oh, thank you. would you like a tour?
what is up?
(whispers) in the cab, on the way over, steve blazed up a doobie.
what?
smoked a joint? you know, lit a bone? weed? hemp? ganja?
ok, ok. I am with you, cheech. ok.
let me, let me get you some wine!
yeah, i think we are ready for our first course. (steve sits, monica brings over a tray) ok, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.
I am so glad you liked them!
oh, well... um, that is all there are of these. but in about eight and a half minutes, we will be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
excuse me? can i help you with anything?
(joining him and taking the taco shells) you know that? you do not want to spoil your appetite.
you know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
no, we do not. (reaches for box)
why do not you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the gummi-bears. monica spots him.) ok... give me the gummi-bears.
give them to me.
no, give me the...
(furious) that is it! dinner is over!
what?
why? it is just that I have waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can not even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
what a tool!
you do not want to work for a guy like that.
yeah!
i know... it is just... i thought this was, you know... it.
look, you will get there. you are an amazing chef.
yeah! you know all those yummy noises? i was not faking.
(to ross) so, er... how did it go with celia?
oh, i was unbelievable.
all right, ross!
i was the james michener of dirty talk. it was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. i mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
whoa! and the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
well, ahem... you know, by the time we would finished with all the dirty talk, it was kind of late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
you cuddled.
yeah, which was nice.
you guys want to try and catch a late movie or something?
maybe, but should not we wait for chandler?
yeah, where the hell is he?
(on phone) yes, fran. i know what time it is, but I am looking at the wenus and I am not happy!... (listens) oh, really, really, really? well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because i care about it! you got it? good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) whooooaaaa....
how is this? (presses down hard)
sorry. how about over here? (presses down hard again)
see, that just means it is working. does this hurt? (presses down elsewhere)
what about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)
there you go! (she continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)
listen y’know what sir? for the last time, i do not care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch dr. do-me-a-little!
(entering) hey!
oh! joey uh, were you in our room last night?
no. (phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to joey who gets mad.) i was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
(to the front desk clerk) hi! we are checking out of the bridal suite.
(depressed) that is right. I am no longer a bride. I will never be a bride again. now, I am just someone is wife!
and I am the happiest guy in the world! (monica goes and sits down in a huff.) oh honey, come on do not be upset. we still have so much to look forward to!
oh yeah, right. (rolls her eyes.)
we got the honeymoon.
that is not ‘til thursday.
the wedding pictures?
they will not be ready for weeks.
not the disposable cameras from the tables.
that is true! (happily) i knew i married you for a reason!
I will tell you what, i will go get them developed and you can go home.
okay.
what? what did you take a picture of?
nothing! it was something.
okay ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
are you joking? check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.
oh.
ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. until y’know, he screamed out radisson at the end.
okay, well I am going to get ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (joey laughs again.) 32 joe. you are 32! (exits)
oh thanks. (reading the bill) champagne, strawberries…oh my god! i can not believe chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
yeah, that is sad. mashuga nut?
hi.
hey. (he sees that ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) soaps? shampoos? are you really taking all this stuff?
why not? it is built into the price of the room.
yeah but you do not need—(picks up something)—what is this?
thread!
score! where are the disposable cameras?
what disposable cameras?
the cameras? remember last night i told you to take them?
no you did not.
yes! remember? right before we cut the cake, i went up to you and i said…
oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if i could do you a favor, and my uncle murray came up to you and handed you a check. and then you said, "why do they call it a check? why not a yugoslavian?" (chandler laughs.) yeah, then you did that.
so you do not have the cameras?!
no. sorry man.
so? what? what? they are gone! monica’s going to freak!
well, I am sure they are still somewhere here in the hotel. I will-I will help you look for them.
great.
in-in three minutes.
hey!
hey!
are you going to open the presents without chandler?
no! (pause) but, they are callin’ out to me! i mean this little guy (holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. oh come on, chandler would not mind if i opened just one present! what do you think it is?
a little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
a tiny salt shaker!!!
ohhh! my god! for tiny salt!
oh wow! okay. well that was fun.
oh yeah.
good. okay, I am just going to wait for chandler to open the rest of them.
okay.
whew. although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. i mean… i guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. what do you think?
well i guess it is okay to open one more if it is part of a set. y’know, it is probably this one. (grabs another small one.)
or this one! (she grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)
(entering) hi.
hey, how are you feelin’? any morning sickness?
shh-shh-shh! the guys do not know yet do they?
no! joey and ross do not know anything and chandler still thinks that phoebe’s pregnant.
yeah that is right chandler does still think I am pregnant. he has not asked me how I am feeling or offered to carry my bags. boy, i feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (monica looks at her.) after you of course.
do not worry i promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘because I am going to tell the father today.
ooh, is it someone in this building? is it that tall guy from the first floor?
ew! no!
what?! i think he is cute.
well then you have his baby.
believe me I am trying.
wow. y’know it is so weird. i mean, you are going to tell this guy today and he has no idea what is going to happen.
yeah. you are just going to knock on his door and change his life forever. you are like ed mcmahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.
yeah. uh-huh, i guess it is pretty big news.
pretty big? it is huge! god, this guy does not have a clue! he is just walking down the street thinking, ‘i had sex with rachel green. i rock!’ then bam! he is a father and everything’s different.
well it is only different if he wants it to be. i mean, I am not going to ask him for anything.
okay. then he still has this huge decision to make. now he is walking around thinking, ‘do i want to be a dad?’ and then bam!
what was that bam?
i do not. he got…he-he-he-he is hit by a bus.
(entering) hey!
hey joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
(warily) who called here? did she sound blond? huh? did-did-did she have an accent? i got to make a call! (starts to leave) i shoulda never walked into that sunglass hut!
oh joey! joey! no, it is not you! you did not get anybody pregnant!
oh. why would you scare me like that? what the hell is going on? (pause.) is somebody pregnant?
oh yeah. that is me.
oh my god pheebs! you are going to have a baby?
yes. yes i am. oh my god, I am going to have a baby! (joey and phoebe hug.)
whoa, wait a minute. who is the father?
you do not know him. it is not important. he wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (she sits down like she is pregnant.)
well who is this guy?! huh? who is he? ‘because i will track him down and kick his ass!
david lynn.
david lynn! david lynn! david lynn!! (exits)
who is david lynn?
oh some guy from my gym. a little annoying.
chandler?
hey! did you find the cameras?
no. did you?
yes! and that is why I am under the table. celebrating.
well i checked in the uh, lost and found, i talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.
well this is great. y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was going to cheer monica up today, she is really depressed.
now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?
all my energy is going into not asking that question. i can not believe i screwed this up!
I am sorry man. (formally dressed people start to enter.) here is a thought. this is the same ballroom. there is a band. there is going to be plenty of dressed up people.
are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
no-no-no, I am saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. all we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.
are you serious?
I am just thinking about your new bride at home. okay? do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
marriage advice? really?!
I am telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! are not these the same flowers?
i do not know, monica picked out the flowers.
what about the chairs?
she picked those out too.
how about the place settings?
that was her.
what did you do?
i was in charge of the cameras! gift shop?
hmm. (they head off to the gift shop.)
hey! ooh, did you do it yet?
not yet.
oh, well what are you doing here? are you about to do it? (gasps) is it gunther?
no! phoebe, it is not gunther.
thank god, ‘because that hair on a baby…
phoebe the father is not here okay? i have not told him yet and i do not think i can tell him at all now!
why not?
i do not know, let me think. i was walking down the street thinking, ‘I am going to tell the father today’ and then bam!
bus?
no, you! phoebe you freaked me out. you kept saying how huge this all is!
well-well but it is huge.
i know, but i was just thinking about how huge this is for me. i did not even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
you are thinking about this way too much. just tell him and get it over with. it is like, it is like ripping off this band-aid. (on her arm) quick and painless, watch. (rips it off.) oh mother of…see?
(entering) ooh-ooh-ooh! are we opening presents?
no! no! i should not have even opened these! i mean i—joey i am out of control!! joey, you have to do me a favor. no matter what i say, no matter what i do, please do not let me open another present! okay?
okay.
give me one more.
okay. (hands her one.)
(entering) hey.
oh good, uh you are here. uh pheebs? listen uh sit down. i-i got something i want to say.
all right. (she sits down like she is pregnant again.)
umm, now uh… it is a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. y’know, now i always thought you and i had a special bond so… (he goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) phoebe buffay, will you marry me?
oh my god! joey!
hell yeah! I will marry you! (she grabs the ring and puts it on.)
you can not marry him!
hey lady, your day’s over! it is my turn!
phoebe!
why?! why can not she marry me?!
i can and i will! (kisses him.)
she is not pregnant. it is rachel. rachel’s the one who is pregnant.
oh my god.
hey!
phoebe i think he would notice if you did not have a baby in nine months!
it is joey! (joey turns and looks at her and she mouths ‘i love you’ to him.)
(smiles then stops) now i can not believe it! what? rachel’s pregnant? (the girls nod yes.) who is the father?
we do not know.
ohh… i wonder if that dude.
there is a dude?
yeah.
who? who is it?
about a month ago this guy spent the night with rachel, i did not see who it was but… (he walks out and closes the door.)
was that story over?
the guy left this.
(gasps) oh my god! i know who the father is… (she walks into monica and chandler’s.)
people have got to finish their stories!
(to another couple) uh, excuse me? could you take a picture of us?
uhh… yeah sure. (holds the camera up to his face.) click!
i heard it. i heard it.
oh yeah. I will take, I will take your picture. (he takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
who are you? ansel adams?! get outta here!
look, i feel really bad about how i freaked you out before, so i called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. go!
what? hey wait a minute! phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
i may play the fool at times, but I am a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that will not quit. (she takes the sweater out of her purse.) i believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
oh god… oh, he is in there right now?
uh-huh. now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the band-aid off. what to you want to do?
uh, let us rip!
really? are you sure?
oh phoebe!
okay, sorry. yeah. (they go inside to confront the father.)
why do not you go up on stage. I will get a picture of you doing the speech.
okay. okay!
will the owner of a 1995 buick lesabre please see the front desk? your car is about to be towed.
a ’95 lesabre?!
a green lesabre?
I am sorry, i meant a blue lesabre.
well go! go move it! (he runs off.)
okay, you ready for the last picture?
yeah.
get ready to run. (chandler walks over to the new bride.) congratulations on your wedding. (he grabs her, kisses her, ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)
rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, i believe that this is your red sweater.
oh no. could i get anyone a coffee or…poison? no? just for me? okay. (walks away.)
nothing! phoebe kind of made a mistake. but y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
oh, it is just not the right time.
okay.
tag…
I am having a baby.
you can go.
(throwing up the last present) i do not know how any of these got opened?!
(entering) you opened them all?
i know! i know! i am a terrible person! i mean, chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
oh hey! you got my parent’s gift! (holds it up.)
yeah. what is that?
well, i do not know. i think it does something to salami.
hey! how did it go?
yeah. what-what did tag say?
tag is not the father! and joey knows now?
i do rach. i do, and i so happy for you. (they hug.)
oh wow, you did not even try to unhook my bra!
so are you ever going to tell whoever it is?
no, i will. I am just not up for it tonight.
hey rach listen, no matter what this guy says i want you to know you are not going to be alone in this.
I am not?
listen i uh… (he takes her hand.) it is a scary world out there especially if you are a single mom. y’know, i always felt like you and i have this-this special bond. y’know? so, (gets down on one knee again) rachel green will you marry me?
what?
what?!
what?!!
pheebs, give me the ring back!
no!!
no! joey, oh you are so sweet. you are so-so sweet, honey. but I am not, I am not looking for a husband.
(heartbroken) i understand.
now, if you will excuse me i am going to go and lie down. (exits.)
i can not say that did not hurt. but I will take you back joey tribbiani.
uh yeah. pheebs, listen about that. i only offered…
ooh! a salami buddy!
there you go!
we are back!
great! we are hangin’ in the kitchen! (she drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) let us stay in the kitchen!
it is picture time.
now you are going to love these.
(showing her the pictures) here is a picture of ross. (shows another one.) and that is me. (another one.) and that is me and ross. (another one.) oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
wow! that is a great picture!
eh?
yeah! oh and interesting because i found the cameras in one of our bags! (throws them into his chest.)
huh, did not see that coming.
okay, so this is not a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. which by the look on your face I am sure you will remember. so we do not need—(rips the picture)—there is no need to have this picture. how about i take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
that would be a good idea.
okay. (sees the living room.) you opened all the presents without me?! i thought we were supposed to do that together!
you kissed another woman!
call it even?!
okay! (they high-five and he walks out.)
well, I am going to go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.
wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
no-no, i took them from the hotel lobby. yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (starts to leave.) hey! my sweater! I have been looking for this for like a month!
(slow on the uptake) oh my god!
hey! how you doing?
yeah.
oh hey, right back at ya.
yeah. she—well, she is one crazy lady?
(shows tag his sweater tag) umm, i do not some italian guy. come on, read your own label. see you later.
he is so weird.
hey!
hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
oh, yeah, no problems. it is all taken care of.
ross, thank you. hey, do you guys want to go see a movie?
oh yeah, why not?
okay, umm, I am going to get my sweater. (walks away.)
okay. (sits down next to phoebe.) you uh, you want to hear something weird?
always.
i did not get the annulment.
what?!
we are still married! do not tell rachel. see you later. (he gets up leaving phoebe in shock.)
(to rachel) hey, do you have any gum?
oh? yeah! sure!
(running out) wait! wait! hi! listen, ross can i just talk to you for just a second?
oh but phoebe, we are going to be late for the movie.
oh, there is a cab! taxi!! (the cab stops and she opens the door.) good timing, my god, huh? here you go. (pushes rachel in and closes the door.)
yeah, we are, we are actually just going to walk ‘because it is right up there at the angelica.
oh, the angelica!! go! go! (she bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (to ross) you did not get the annulment?!!
i know.
ross?!
well, i tried! but when i got to my lawyer’s office all i could hear was, "three divorces. three divorces!" look, i just do not want my tombstone to read, ross gellar, three divorces.
do not be worried about that! your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! it could say, ross geller, good at marriage! y’know? mine’s going to say phoebe buffay, buried alive.
look, all i know is i-i can not have another failed marriage!
so okay what? you are going to be married to a girl who does not even know about it?!—op, woman! sorry.
well, okay so, i do not have it all worked out quite yet. just do not say anything to rachel, please?
rachel is one of my closest friends. (pause) although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. okay!
(to the driver) okay, stop-stop! phoebe?!
hey rach!
what was that?!
sorry, mix up. hey, how was the movie?
i have not seen it yet!
well then you would better hurry! the angelica! go! go! (bangs on the roof again and off they go.)
noooooooo!!
y’know when we move in together, can i get a gumball machine?
of course! joey would not let you have one?
no. when it comes to sweets, he is surprisingly strict.
hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you are moving out?
no, no, i keep trying, y’know? i can get out, "joey, i have too…" but then i lose my nerve and i always finish with, "…go to the bathroom." he may think I am sick.
y’know, i really have to tell rachel, but i… we just have to get it over with! y’know, the next time we see them we are just going to tell them. okay? that is it.
oh, so that is this is going to work now? you are just going to order me around all the time?
pretty much.
all right.
(entering) hey monica!
hi!
(to chandler) hey man, you feeling any better? (chandler answers him with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)
joey, we have something to tell you.
oh my god! you are pregnant!
no-of-of! (to monica) no? (she nods no.) no-of-of! look joey, here is the thing, monica and i have decided to live together, here. so, I am going to be moving out man.
wow! (tearing up) well, uh… hey! I am really happy for you guys! congratulations! (kisses monica on the cheek) see you later. (starts for the door on the verge of tears as monica stops him.)
wait! joey! joey! are you okay?!
yeah, i got to go! i got an acting job. (turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) like you would believe that. this sucks!
look, i-I am just going to be right across the hall and i promise you, the minute monica and i break up I am moving right back in with you!
(to monica) okay! look-look-look, uh, if you are going to be moving in with him i feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! okay? he is a terrible roommate! terrible! he uh, forgets to umm… oh-oh he always, he always umm—oh, who am i kidding! he is the best roommate ever! (hugs chandler.)
hey pheebs!
hey!
hey, have you seen rachel?
no, why?
i have some pretty exciting news!
(gasps) you are pregnant!
no! chandler and i are moving in together!
ooh! that is good! wow! but now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? hint: phoebe.
hey! hi!
hey!
what is up?
well umm, chandler and i are moving in together.
oh my god. ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. oh, that is great. that is great. (kisses and hugs her.)
guys, I am happy too.
okay, come here! (phoebe joins them in the hug.)
wow! big day huh? people moving in, people getting annulled… (winks at ross.)
okay, i got to go find rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine does not seem so bad? (exits.)
bye.
hmm, something bad to tell rachel… bad news for rachel, what could that be?!
could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? all right? my life is an embarrassment! i should go live under somebody is stairs!
ross, it is not that big a deal! so you will been divorced three times, you will still have a life, you will go on dates…
(interrupting) no! no, i will not! I will be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. the only guys below me will be four divorce guy uh, murderer guy, and-and, geologists.
ross, you are being ridiculous! okay? you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
oh yeah? have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
y’know that is really fair. y’know? most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. ross, nobody cares about this except you! this-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! here, I will show you! come here.
what?! why?
(to the girls) hi! hi! listen, my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but would not you date him?
and if you wait right here, I will go get ross. (phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)
(entering) hey!
ugh, i thought you were rachel!
(looking down) what gave me away?
i just tell her, i have to get it over with. i told ross and phoebe and she is the only one left!
okay, so that is it, everybody knows! it is official, we are moving in together. no turning back. are ya scared? are ya?
no.
wow that was my scariest voice! you are very brave.
hey!
hey.
ugh, the worse day! y’know, you think you are making progress at work and then your boss calls you raquel.
hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me sha-la-lap. (awkward silence ensues.) seriously.
i believe you. so, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me raquel! by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky!
well, i-i still think you are very-very nice and very pretty…
what?
(to monica) all yours babe. (walks away.)
have a seat. (they sit at the table.) okay, listen umm, chandler and i are going to live together, here.
oh my god! that is so great! I am so happy for you guys!
really?!
and that was so sweet of you to ask! oh my god, the three of us are going to have such a good time living together!
yes, we are. (chandler is frantically trying to get monica to correct her.)
and chandler, you are going to have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know raquel can not be late.
rach…
yeah, he is going to work on that.
ohh! this is so exciting! oh god… (gasps and starts to sing) come and knock on my door…
(singing) we will be waiting for you…
…once you know the stories, it is not that bad. first marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. third marriage, well they really should not allow you to get married when you are that drunk and have writing all over your face, nevada’s fault.
okay, so what do you think ladies? who would not be interested? who would not want to date him?
okay, what about you? (points to karin) would not you want a date?
(interrupting) whatever! what about you meg?
what?!
(leaning to him) she said, "he is obviously still in love with this rachel girl." (he glares at her.)
this is crazy! i mean, yes-yes rachel is my good friend and i-i have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
well, i thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
we were drunk! i would have married uh, joey with that amount of alcohol!
hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!!
(to the panel) look, I am sorry, but you guys are wrong. i just do not want to be divorced three times.
yes, and now he is using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. i must say, "well done!" bravo meg.
(getting up) okay! fine! fine! if-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! okay, i-I will go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! okay?! because she means nothing to me! noth—(leans down to meg’s ear)—nothing!!
okay, when are we going to tell rachel what is actually going to happen?
soon! i-i just could not before. you saw how upset joey got! i could not do that to her, she is my best friend!
well, joey’s my best friend.
I am not your best friend?
you just said… of course you are my best friend. would you please tell rachel though?
all right, all right, at least I am prepared.
okay. (she grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) oh yes. (he reaches for one.)
(slapping his hand) hey!
hey-hey!
these are not for you! are you upset?
i am now!
(entering) hey roomie!
okay, bye! (exits.)
rach, there is something uh, important i have to tell you.
(gasps) are you pregnant?!
no! but, I am throwing this shirt away! i think there was a little misunderstanding before.
um-hmm.
umm, when i said that uh, that chandler and i wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
(laughs) oh my god! oh, that is funny, i can not believe i did that.
oh no sweetie, no! this is my fault, i was not clear! I am really sorry. and listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? there is absolutely no rush.
okay. (sits back and resumes her reading.)
okay. do not you want a cookie?
sure? (monica hands her one.) thanks.
maybe, do you need a tissue?
monica, where did you get these?!
i made them!
ooh, good god, they are so yummy! (she re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)
god, it is going to so weird like when i come home and you are not here. y’know? no more joey and chan’s. no more j and c’s. "you want to go over to joey and chandler’s?" "can not, its not there."
look, I am just going to be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
yeah but we will not be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
not once did we do that.
(entering) hi.
hey!
hi.
so i, i told rachel it was just going to be the two of us.
oh yeah? well, how did she take it?
really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she did not cry. she was not angry or sad. (sits down, slightly disgusted.)
and you are upset because you did not make your best friend cry?
i mean, all I am asking for is just a little emotion! is that too much to ask after six years?! i mean what? are-are-are rachel and i not as close as you guys?! i mean do we not have as much fun?! do not i deserve a few tears?!! i mean we-we told joey, he cried his eyes out!
hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! it is like the end of an era! no more j-man and channie’s!!
okay, i got to ask, who calls us that?!
yes.
yes, second in two years. third overall.
basically, rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk…
yes-yes-yes! but, i-i do not love her.
this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled.
i think just the annulment for today.
easy.
no problem.
ooh! there is no way to do this without her? ‘because i kind of all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
uh-ha, what about someone who looks like rachel? (russell glares at him.) i will think about the therapy.
hey!
hey. so um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
okay!
y’know, no point in dragging it out. dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
okay.
hey rach, what about this? (she holds up a chrome 5-point star.) huh? who-who gets this? see, i do not know if i want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!
(grabbing the star) what the hell is that?
i do not know. (picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) hey, rachel, you want the big plate? i want you to have the big plate.
wow! mon, thanks! i love this plate!
something to remember me by!
mon, honey you are not dying. I am just moving out. y’know, i mean we are going to see each other all the time.
but still, it is a big change. the end of an era, you might say!
are you okay? you are not blinking.
I am fine! i just, I am thinking how much it is an end of era.
oh, all right. but y’know i got to say, i do not, i do not think six years counts as an era.
an era is defined as a significant period of time. now, it was significant to me, maybe it was not significant to you!
what is the matter with you?!
what is the matter with you?!! why are not you more upset?! are not you going to be sad that we are not going to be living together anymore?! i mean are not you going to miss me at all?!
all right, fine, but do not get mad at me. it is-it is just a little hard to believe.
what is hard to believe?
well y’know, it is you guys. you-you do this kind of stuff! y’know? i mean, you-you were going to get married in vegas and then you backed out! i guess I am not upset because i do not see you guys going through with it. I am sorry.
rachel, it is going to happen. chandler is going to move in here.
but i…
no-no, wait! just let me finish, okay? this is not something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in vegas, this is something we both really want. and it is going to happen.
it is? really?
yeah, sweetie.
(starting to lose her composure) i mean we are not, we are not going to live together anymore?
no.
what? oh my god! I am going to miss you so much! (starts to cry.)
I am going to miss you! (they hug.)
i mean it is the end of an era!
i know!
(to joey and chandler) okay, bye!
oh no.
so? did you get the annulment?
i could not.
i knew it! because you love rachel.
it is not that. okay? annulments are more complicated than i…
yeah, complicated ‘because of the love.
i… i do, i do not love rachel. I am going to tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. okay? would i do that if i loved her?
I have never been more convinced of your love for her.
i do not have feelings for rachel! okay?! (he goes into her apartment.)
ohh, what is wrong?!
monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing.
oh my—come here! come here! (he hugs her.) it is okay. everything’s going to be okay.
thank you.
of course.
so, ross and rachel got married, monica and chandler almost got married, do you think you and i should hook up?
oh we do, but not just yet.
really?! well, when?
okay umm, well, first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. yeah. but it will not work out.
wow.
i know. then, I am going to marry chandler for the money and you will marry rachel and have the beautiful kids.
great!
but then we ditch those two and that is when we get married. we will have chandler’s money and rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel’s drinking problem.
oh-oh, what about ross?
i do not want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and i kill him.
monica, hey, can i borrow the porsche?
ok.
alright!
but ehm...what is it not?
(abashed) a place to entertain my lady friends.
and what else is it not?
(even more abashed) a place to eat spaghetti.
very good! (gives him the keys) what do you need it for anyway?
oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they do not sell tickets here in new york, so...
oh! so you are driving up to connecticut?
(hesitates for a moment)yeah connecticut...not west virginia.
hey, maybe I will drive you up there! I would like to buy some tickets myself!
uh!
yeah with chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
yeah, because if i was at my old job we would say 300 million? no thank you!
hey will you get me tickets too?
yeah me too. oh! i have an idea. why do not we all pitch in 50 bucks, we will pool our money together and then if we win, we will split it!
no thanks!
you do not want to win the lottery?
(in a mocking voice)uh...sure i do, and i also want to be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart.
still on amelia earhart?
the woman just vanished!
seriously, ross, you do not want in on this?
no! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? i...i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
yes but there is six of us so we would only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
i like those odds!
seriously you guys, i can not believe you are going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, i mean that is such a bunch of boohaki.
(looking around at the others)I will ask. (to ross) boohaki?
oh oh, we think emma is about to start talking so we are trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
how do you know she is going to start talking?
well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what I am saying.
kind of like joey.
(who was not paying attention)what is that now?
god! look at all these tickets! it is so exciting! you know i have not won anything since the sixth grade.
pie eating contest?
oh! you assume because i was heavy that is the only way i could win something?
no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
(smiling)that was a good day!
(yelling to monica)they are towing your car, they are towing your car!!
I am parked in a garage on morton!
(panting)they are towing a car. and i am seeing...spots.
(sounding panicky)oh my god ross! you do not have emma! and rachel you do not have emma! (starts yelling) where is emma? who has emma!?
joey relax! my mother picked her up two hours ago. you were there!
(not yelling anymore)i was?
i did?
she dropped off a casserole?
oh yeah! the casserole lady.
(to ross)so, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
yeah, uh... and then i figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
(hysterical)do not touch the phone! I will get it, I will get it, I will get it!! (picks up the phone)
(to monica)think he washed his hands?
(into receiver)hello? hey charlie, what do you know?
(to monica)what is going on?
chandler is supposed to find out if he is getting an assistent job at his ad agency. but out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
ooh! tough odds!
(mockingly)yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
(smiling)look who is coming around!
(still on the phone)damnit. alright call me when you know more.
(excited)did you get it?
one of the slots got filled.
(still excited)by you!?
sense the tone! no that kid nate got it.
oh! i hate that guy! i mean come on kid! pull up your pants!
yeah i know.
well, there is two spots left right?
yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i want to get one, i want my friend charlie to get one...except i do not care about charlie.
(excited)hey you guys! ok, you are not going to believe this! i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely going to win the lottery tonight!
hey that reminds me, i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work.
(mockingly)a psychic and a wishbone? guys! give someone else a chance!
alright, who wants to do it?
oh can i? vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. it is really not fair either! you know, just because we do not eat the meat does not mean we do not like to play with the carcasses!
ok, hey rach?
oh no, I am good, i do not want to get that turkey smell all over my hands.
I will do it!! it will get the casserole stink off of mine.
i hope i win!
well, it does not really matter ... you are both wishing for the same thing, right?
i can not tell you what I am wishing for! else...you know...will not come true!
right! .. but we "know" what you are wishing for!
can not really say!
i understand, but you are wishing for what we think you are wishing for, are not you?
(slightly irritated)I am not really comfortable with these questions!
one, two, three!
i won, hey!
you know what, I am sure your wish is going to come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! (rubs lamp, stops because it is very hot) ah!! that thing gets hot!!
you know, ross, just keep making your jokes. how are you going to feel if we actually do win?
uh, you are not going to win.
oh, i know, i know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! and then how you going to feel? you know, we are going to be all like "oh everybody, let us take our helicopters up to the cape" and you are going to be all like "oh, i can not guys, I will meet you guys up there, i got to gas up the hyundai"
ok, I have heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that.
i can see the headline now: "lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
why would i eat my own arm?
well you would not, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
you know what, ross? I am going to throw in 50 bucks for you.
why?
because i know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we are all here and going to watch the numbers and have fun. and you are my brother, and i want you to be a part of this.
you do not have to do that, I will pay for myself. but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that is so sweet! come here (they kiss and hug)
get a room!
ok, so now that you are in, what are you going to do if we win?
i do not know, probably just invest it.
ooh! calm down ...
seriously, that is your fantasy? to invest it?
oh, I am sorry, did i say "invest it"? i meant "be cool and piss it all away" (joey and chandler pleased)
ooh, ooh, i know! we should pool all own money and buy the knicks!
i do not really care about the knicks.
oh, you will when i pick you as starting forward.
(touched) you would do that? i never get picked!
you know, I am not sure a sports team is the way to go.
you are not going to let me buy the knicks?? i can not believe you are taking this away from me!
you are right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
(to rachel) uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?
(looks around) I will take this one too (to ross) uh ... mommy?
oh, I have gotten into the habit of calling rachel "mommy" when we are around emma. which i now realize we are not ...
I am hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
although if we are going to do that, we should probably call me "daddy" too.
oooh, i like that, "daddy" (in a sexy tone)
i ... i was just talking about rachel.
(still in sexy tone) oooh, is daddy getting angry? is daddy going to spank me?
(tries to be sexy too) well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no i can not.
hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody else hear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept with him!! .. alright, bye. (hangs up)
dude, I am sorry. but hey, there is one spot left, right?
well no, charlie's going to get that.
hey, do not say that! you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
he is the boss's son.
come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)
ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
ok, here we go. we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we have won. so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (does not let them answer) ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
ooh, i have another idea!
I am sorry, idea time is over.
ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
yeah.
what about the ones you have on the nightstand?
there are no tickets on the nightstand!
yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago.
un, no you did not! you must be mistaken!
honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
chandler, sense the tone!!
well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
ok, fine!! i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler.
uh! the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.
i can not believe this, i thought we were all in this together!
hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
3 minutes ago!!! i do not know why that is important ...
i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut, when did you even get those?
when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
(to ross) I will show you how.
ok, well monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? how are you going to feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
please ... if i win the lottery, you guys are not going to leave me. someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and i could not get rid of you for 3 days!
chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
(to mon) she is right, you should not have bought tickets just for us ...
ahhh! (shocked)
let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it does not look like I am going to get this job so i can not afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from rachel)
there is the man i married!!
all right, believe me.if you win the lottery, it is the last you are going to hear from us!
fine! do not be my friends! I will buy new friends! yeah, and then I will pay for their plastic surgery so they would look just like you!
(surprised) oh! alright, you know what? that is it! i want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!
yeah, i want my tickets too (takes the bowl from rachel)! and I am buying the knicks! and steffi graff, ah ah!
than i want mine, too (takes the bowl from joey)! and if i win I am going to put it all into a very low-yield bond.
oh, you guys! we have got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from ross and puts it on the table)
no, no! we should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! this all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from monica)
oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!
ok, that is it! just give'them to me! I will split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from joey's hands but she can not, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)
(in pain) oh!
(she takes the bowl from rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) ooooohhhhh!
(trying to stop her) hey, hey!!
(keeping on running and yelling) ooooohhhhh! (she stops) fine, i can not take it anymore! I am putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)
oh, if she jumps, i get her tickets.
no, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)
if we are not doing it together, we are not doing it at all! so, say goodbye to your tickets! (she holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).
do not come any closer!
can i come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
no, what is more important, your friends or money?
money! (they all look at her) friends...
hey monica, what about your extra tickets?
they are all in there! even these five that i hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to phoebe)...
monica!
ok, good! (pause) you guys were so scared! there was no way i was going to dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) oh god, no! (pause) i think i broke your bowl.
go, go, go!!
what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. and the wind sure made it fun.
phoebe, we lost half of them.
so, what? monica, we have the winning ticket! my psychic said i was going to win, remember?
weird.. your psychic did not mention anything about the scary pigeon...
as a matter of fact she said that is how i am going to die. (pause ) so, excuse me for being a little skittish.
(looking at the answering machine) hey, there is two messages. these could be from work!
oh, play them!
ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)
well, i bet that was very hard for him to do.
this is..shhh!
oh god, i am so sorry honey...
oh, it is so unfair. it is like that time they promoted sandra over me at work.
oh, is she related to ralph lauren?
no, she was just much better at job than me!
guys, the drawing is about to start!
(to ross) you know what? we should call my mum's house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down.
oh yeah, it is a good idea!
(she hugs chandler) honey, you have been really strong about this, i know how badly you wanted that job.
yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it. (pause) but... let us go win the lottery... i mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
(she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)
(on the phone) goodnight sweetheart! i love you. and remember, you are daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to rachel) phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to rachel)
hi mum, put her back on!
(sitting on the sofa in front of the tv) rach, come on! they are announcing the numbers! my god, i can already feel myself changing.
i got that!
oh, we have one too!!
we are on a roll, people!!
(calling rachel) come on!!
(on the phone) mum, please!i know you love your new lips, but i can barely understand you! would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
check your numbers! make me rich!
(she goes towards the others and she is very excited) guys, you are not going to believe this! i was just saying goodnight to emma and she said her first words!!
and what did she say?
she said "gleba"!! (she celebrates)
make me rich!!
(to ross) is not that amazing?
oh yeah, no no no...that is great!
why-why are not you more excited?
oh, rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
oh, but of course it is!
okay, what does it mean?
i do not know all the words.
I am just, I am just glad i did not miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).
yes you did, gleba is a word!
ok, use it in a sentence.
ok... "emma just said gleba"!
it is not a word!
okay, okay, okay, fine, I am going to look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).
oh, oh, ok, great. you know what, while you are at it she said another word the other day, why do not you, why do not you look up: pbbqqt....
(searching the dictionary) alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) gleba! ha! here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
she is going to be a scientist! (kisses rachel on the head, very moved)
(checking the last ticket) damnit! anybody got anything?
no.
I am still looking through mine...
just double checking (does so)...no, no, no...(takes off a shoe and takes a ticket out of it) no!
(answering phone) hello? hold on. it is your boss.
ah, the "I am sorry i rejected you" phone call. I am not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) hey, steve.
oh no no no no, I would love to be somebody is assistant! answering phones, getting coffee, i live for that stuff! and I am not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
ok well, thanks, you will not regret it. I will see you tomorrow (hangs up).
what? (pause) oh, yeah, I am going to be a junior copywriter.
oh sweetie, I am so proud of you!
does that mean i get the good loving tonight?
you bet! no tv or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)
(to chandler) hey, that is so great about the job.
thanks, man.
and i like to think i had a little something to do with it.
really? what?
well, before, with the wishbone... i did not wish we would win the lottery, i wished you would get the job.
(smiling, surprised) oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) listen, do not tell monica, she will rip your heart right out.
oh yeah.
you know what? there is a little part of me that really thought we were going to win.
me too. so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park.
you guys, what was the powerball number again?
we won.
what?
we won!
let me see!
do not tear it.
phoebe, you do not have any of the first five numbers.
i know that, but look, we have got the powerball number, we have won 3 dollars!
wow, you would think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
(still very excited) i do not care, I have never won anything before, i can not believe this!
so pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
it is not all mine. we all get 50 cents.
you know what? you can have mine.
me too.
me too.
me too.
i guess if everybody else is...
(sitting in a chair) hey guys, so i just called the powerball hotline, can you believe it? nobody won.
i beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).
(hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the "pigeon voice" from before) coo, again. do not blame the pretty lady. it was not her fault. it was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) seriously, stop staring at her.
the reactor’s going to blow in three seconds, we are never going to make it!
you have got to get out of here! save yourself!
no! i will not leave you!
do not worry about me, I am a robot! I am just a machine!!
no you are not! not to me!
(she stops reading from the script) oh my god.
what?
i am extremely talented!
yeah, you are great! okay, let us take it from…
(interrupting) no, i mean i was really acting my ass off.
yeah, i thought i was pretty good too.
oh yeah, you are solid. yeah, you are just no me.
y’know what? i think that is enough for now. yeah. i do not want to be over rehearsed.
(tremendously overacting) fine! I will do it without you! (joey gives her thumbs up) i do not need you or anybody else! I am going to make it on my own! (joey closes the door to his bedroom.) you will see!! you will all see!!
(to joey) so uh, what is this thing you are auditioning for?
oh, it is a new tv show. yeah. I am up for the part of mac macaveli or "mac." yeah, I am a detective and i solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. he is a, he is a computerized humanoid electronically enhanced secret enforcer or-or "c.h.e.e.s.e."
so mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.
that is the title! yeah! y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
that is lucky.
huh—wait so joey if you get this, you are going to be like the star of your own tv show! i mean you will be like the big cheese! (to phoebe) or the big mac—hey! you love those!
well, do not get your hopes up, because probably not going to happen.
now-now, why would you say that joseph?
i mean come on you guys! my own tv show? i just do not know if I am good enough.
i am.
joey, what are you talking about? you are a terrific actor.
you really think so?
ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
 whoa, she is pretty. (mentioning the girl on tv)
 yeah, and oh she is really nice too. she taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
 I am sorry, what?
 what?
 excuse me?
 it is like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you are thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. (does this intense look where it looks like he is smelling a fart.)
 oh, ok.
(there is a gunshot on tv) there is my scene, there is my scene. [joey on tv] "mrs. wallace, I am dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.  I am afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..." (does the smell-the-fart look.)
(on stage in an austrian accent) vell, eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and i vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (he goes into a song and dance number.)
 i play al pacino's butt. all right? he goes into the shower, and then- I am his butt.
(trying not to laugh) oh my god.
 c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that is big!
oh no, it is terrific, it is- it is- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you have finally been able to crack your way into show business.
okay, okay, fine! make jokes, i do not care! this is a big break for me!
you are right, you are right, it is.
 yes.
 so you going to invite us all to the big opening?
all right well, I am outta here. wish me luck.
(overacting with a song this time) (singing) gooood luck! gooood luck! we all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
yeah, whatever. (exits.)
it is your turn.
oh, are we playing this?!
(entering, dejectedly) hey.
hey! how did the audition go?
terrible! i messed up every line! i should not even be an actor!
wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it did not go well but it really did go well?
yeah, did i fool ya?

so it did go well.
oh, it went amazingly well!
great!
oh that is great!
yeah-yeah, it is down to me and two other guys.
oh my god!
wow!
and i know both of them, they are really good. one of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who is always getting chased by those big flowers…
oh, i love that guy! (laughs.)
oh-oh, what are you doing?
(stops laughing) what am i doing?
I am just so nervous! y’know? the callback is not until tomorrow at five. i feel like my head is going to explode!
well, it is overdue.
look, do not worry. okay? you are going to be fine.
there is just so much pressure. i mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. i do not know if you would understand.
yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
(on phone) yes, fran. i know what time it is, but I am looking at the wenus and I am not happy!
 alright, well I am tearing the lettuce.
 oh-oh, no no do not worry, I am going to wash it.
 that is your call.
 well, i thought that i would cut up the tomatos.
 they'r alright.
 no really, they are ok.
 actually, i was going to do them jullienne.
 I am outa here. [monica leaves]
 (on the phone) monica, I am quitting! i just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she did not even buy it! (pause) I am telling you I am quitting! that is it! I am talking to my boss right now! (pause) yes i am! (pause) yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! yes i am! okay bye, call me when you get this message. (hangs up.)
 well, what happened?
 well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... (the flashback shows paulo lying face down on the massage table and slowly moving his hands up phoebe's legs and grabbing her butt.)
 oh my god!
 and all of the sudden his hands were not the problem anymore. (the flashback shows paulo rolling over and showing phoebe his equipment.)
 was it...
 oh, boy scouts could have camped under it!
you ate my sandwich?
(getting upset) oh-oh really?
(jumping to his feet in anger) what?
you-you-you-you (trying to remain in control) threw my sandwich away!
 (losing control, we hear him shout outside) my sandwich?!!!
my sandwich!!!!!! (ross's scream scares a flight of pigeons away.)
i want this part so much! y’know? if i do not get this part I am never going to eat macaroni and cheese again!—no, i did not say that! that is a lie.
oh come on guys, it is not like i moved to europe! i just moved across the hall! and we would have you over all the time if it were not for (struggles to get this out) monica’s allergies. (the duck quacks.) you are right, i could never lie to you. she hates you. (the phone rings.) should i get that? (laughs, then answers the phone.) hello? (listens) uh no, joey’s not here right now. can i take a message? (listens) yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30? (listens) okay great. (listens.) bye. (hangs up the phone and goes to write the message on the magna-doodle on the door but monica walks in and forces him to jump out of the way.)
(startled) ahh! are not you dressed yet?
(looks down at his clothes) am i naked again?!
we are supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
yeah okay, i was just talking to the guys. just look at them i mean, is it okay if they come visit?
wh?! what about my allergies?!
oh right, your allergies. (monica leaves and to the chick and duck) all her, she hates you. (chandler leaves without finishing the message for joey.)
yes!! ha-ha!! all right! hey! how cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? huh? i mean how crazy would that be?
as crazy as soccer?
(on phone) hello? (listens) what are you talking about? the audition’s not ‘til 5:00! (chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as joey listens.) well, nobody told me! (listens) who would you talk to? (listens and turns around to see chandler trying to finish the message.) nevermind! (hangs up.)
you mean you did not get it from this?
the allergy guy got the part! thanks!
well, maybe we can fix it y’know? maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
how could you do this to me chandler?! this part could have turned my whole career around!
i messed up. okay? I am sorry, i really messed up.
hey, you do not even live here anymore! what are you doing answering my phone? i have my machine!
which i bought for ya. taught ya how to use it. you thought it was a copier. look, if there was anything i could do, i would do it. okay? but everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?
 you know he coulda gotten me a vcr, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  the eyesore from the liberace house of crap!
 it is not that bad.
 oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you do not have to walk around sporting some reject from the mr. t collection. [joey walks in behind chandler]
 chandler, chandler.
 i pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, i do, i do. i pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees joey] hi!
 yeah, i mean when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking, and one thing to another and…
 and what?! did you sleep with her?!
 no! no! no! i just kissed her.
 what?!! that is even worse!!
 how is that worse?!
 i do not know! but it is the same!
 you are right, i have no excuses! i was totally over the line.
 over the line?! you-you are-you are so far past the line, that you-you can not even see the line! the line is a dot to you!
look, I am not saying that you should magically forgive me! but you are not perfect! you have made some errors in judgment too!
name one!
(let us him out) what happened?!!
(getting out) awww, man! he promised he would not take the chairs!!
 what the hell happened?!! how were you locked in?!! and where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
 well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he did not think big enough to fit a grown man!
 so--you got in voluntarily?!
 i was tryin’ to make a sale!! oh, man, if i ever run into that guy again, do you know what I am going to do?
 bend over?!!!
ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess.
...and what did you bring?
janice?
janice?!
joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
what?
no way!  I have been going to the guy for 12 years.
oh come on!  he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
what?
cupping.
that is how they do pants!  ross, will you tell him? is not that how they measure pants?
yes, yes it is. in prison!
i said name one!
i can not believe i did this! what an idiot!
oh, stop beating yourself up! people make mistakes! these things happen! there are not any message you have forgotten to give me are there? (chandler has a disgusted look on his face.) apparently you are not very good at it! i…
do you think he will ever forgive me?
of course he will! but chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
y’know what? i-i kind of have.
already? that is pretty bad what you did.
y’know what? he will forgive you. and i like to bring a pad with me when i go answer the phone just in case… (chandler gets that disgusted look back.) okay…
you did not see how mad he was, y’know?
I am sure he will forgive you. look, we have all been there! y’know, you fight, you make up, it is just the way it works.
it took two people to break up this relationship!!
yeah! you and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
i did not know what i was taking full responsibility for! okay?! i did not finish the whole letter!
what?!!
i fell asleep!
(mocking him) you fell asleep?!
it was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping monica, chandler, and joey in the kitchen) (to rachel) oh-oh-oh, and by the way, y-of-you-apostrophe-r-e means ‘you are,’ y-of-you-r means ‘your!’
y'know i can not believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
(starts to cry) fine by me!! (he opens the door and traps chandler behind it)
and hey! just so you know, it is not that common! it does not happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!
(coming out from behind the door) i knew it!!!!
you had no right to go out with him.
that is the most ridiculous...
you sold me out.
i did not sell you out.
yes you did.  you absolutely sold me...
would you let me talk. [flicks monica on the forehead]
did you just flick me?
ok, well, you would not let me finish and i was jus- [monica flicks her back] ow. that hurt [flicks monica]
oh!  all right.  now, let us not do this!
happy thoughts!  happy thoughts!
ok, now I am going to kick some ass.
i know!  i know!  i know!
alright, now i will let go if you both stop.

yeah. whew, it is hot with all of this stuff on. i ah, i better not do any, i do not know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)
joey? got you a joey special, two pizzas! joe? (the phone rings and he answers it) (on phone) hello? (takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) damnit! (back on phone.) hello? (listens.) no, joey’s not here right now, but i can take a message i think. (listens) he is still got a chance for the part?! oh, that is great news! (listens) well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (listens) oh well, that is great. i will give joey the message. thank you! (hangs up and goes to write the message on the magna-doodle.) yes! (reading what he is writing) okay, mac audition at 2:00. allergy actor attacked. (pause) by dog not flowers.
hey!
please tell me you got the message!
what message?
the actor playing mac could not do it, they needed to see you at 2 of the clock.
what?! it is 6 of the clock!
du-du-i wrote it, i wrote it on the board! i wrote it on the board, then i went all over new york city looking for ya! i went to ross’s! i went to the coffeehouse! i went to any place that they made sandwiches!
i can not believe this chandler!
sorry! i-i-i do not know what to say.
well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! i saw the board! i went to the audition! i got the part!!
(angrily) is that supposed to be funny! i was really worried over here!
oh, well I am uh…
y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
oh wow! okay man, I am sorry. i did not mean to make you feel bad.
well that is good. because you did not! and I am incredibly happy for ya!!
(shocked) that is mean! you really had me going there!
oh, we could do this all day.
yeah, you are right. okay look, listen, let us talk about what a huge star I am going to be!
you are going to be a huge star! I am going to hug ya!
you hug me!
all right!
hey, do we do this too much?
i think so. yeah, get off me.
yeah.
come on c.h.e.e.s.e., I am not leaving without you! try routing your backup source through your primary cpu.
(overacting badly) i can not! my circuits are fried! they are fried i tell you!!
wow! (back to reading the scene.) well then I will just have to carry you.
that will be a neat trick, when you are, (looks at the script) when you are dead!
ross, you do not have to yell.
there was just an explosion, okay? my hearing would be impaired.
i thought you were excellent! in fact for a minute there i was like, "ooh, where did ross go?"
thank you! and i have to say that first scene when you meet mac…
yeah?
oh my god. i mean…
y’know what? i think that is enough for today. thanks for your help! (he grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)
(to ross) he is holding us back.
totally.
okay!
come on, no peeking! (they are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)
our eyes are closed and we are about to cross the street. very good.
okayyyyy, open up!
what did you want to show us? because all i can see is this bitchin' van!
yeah, it is for our catering business!
i think i know that girl.
all right, umm, we are not going to really keep it this way though.
no?
no, we are going to paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
oh!
and also, we do not know what to do with this. (she turns on a switch and the girl’s nipples light up.)
oh yeah, i definitely know her.
(to phoebe) remember that guy from cooking school i told you about that put cilantro with everything?
oh sure, cilantro larry.
well, I am going to fill in for him as food critic for the chelsea reporter.
wow, monica! what an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.
how could you say yes, what about our catering business?
oh no-no-no, it is only one night a week, and plus i get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
oh, in that case—(hops up and down in joy)—yay! (monica looks confused) that was me hopping on board.
oh.
(entering) hey, you guys! hey, ross, quick question for ya. are you ready to party?
i do not know, i could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there is this thing about bumblebees on the discovery channel that i was planning to watch.
no-no, i do not think you heard me. are you ready to party?!
nooo!! gandolf?! gandolf is coming to town?
kathy’s with her parents, i have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with gandolf dude!

I am going to call and get off work tomorrow!
I am going to call after you!
this is going to be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
all right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
really. and what do you mean you never have fun anymore? you have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
joey, you are going to love this guy. gandolf is like the party wizard!
well, why do you call him gandolf?
gandolf the wizard. (joey is still confused) hello! did not you read lord of the rings in high school?
no, i had sex in high school.
oh, uh, joanna i was wondering if i could ask you something. there is an opening for an assistant buyer in junior miss…
well, actually, i meant for me. the hiring committee is meeting people all day and…
god, i am so glad you do not have a problem with this, because if you did, i would not even consider applying.
(interrupting) and that is I am so glad… there is no problem.
ohh! that is great!
really?!
well, i, umm…
oh man! i am so excited—i may vomit!
will you calm down, he is just a human guy.
look you do not understand, gandolf is amazing. y’know you are never know what is going to end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to nova scotia!
really?!
oh yeah, it is beautiful country up there.
(entering) hey! okay! i got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
it is not going to be exactly like last time.
all right, I will see you guys.
whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
i have an audition, but I will definitely hook up with you later. where are you going to be around noon?
somewhere maybe along the equator?
okay. (leaves as the phone rings)
(answering it) hello. (listens) (to ross) it is gandolf!!! (on phone) so, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) oh, well, well maybe next time then. (hangs up)
what happened?
he is not going to make it, he is stuck in chicago.
ohh, man! chicago, is sooo lucky!
stupid, useless canadian money!
thank you.
well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
yes, joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
i-i-i of course, i have more responsibilities than that.
yes, i realize that…
i love working with designers!
hey! my first review is out!
ohh! oh, the chelsea reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
all right, look at my on the back page.
oh, okay! (reading) "would i go back to allesandro’s? sure, but I would have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." (to monica) wow! you really laid into this place.
hey, they do not pay me a penny a word to make friends.
ooh, i got to go. i found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
oh! do you need me to go with you?
no-no, it is okay. but are we sure we do not want the waterbed?
have not we made this decision?
yeah, all right. (starts to leave)
bye!
bye!
(answering it) who is it?
oh my god.
oh my god, oh my god. (on intercom) call me on the phone!
look, i-I am never going to let you up so you may as well just go away.
(on intercom) hey, do you need to get in? here you go.
no! phoebe!
hey, monica!
i could not eat it! i had five friends who could not eat it, and one of them eats books.
the waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
all right, that I will retract. but i stand by my review, i know food and that was not it. you are marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! you should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
oh my god! you own an italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! where are you even from?
hand me those tomatoes, I am going to show you what it should taste like! come on, hand me them.
(entering joanna’s office) umm, joanna? i want to talk about that interview.
no! it did not! that is what i want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) now, just to brief you… (starts to cry) i may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
there is nobody here!
do you want me to quit?
well of those things that you said in the interview, i mean if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant. y’know what? i am just going to pack up my desk, (she goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and i will be gone by the end of the day! (realizes she has nothing.) well, i guess there is no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! (starts to leave.)
what?
my drinking?
said what? exactly.
oh my god!! ohh, that is it! I am leaving! you are just a horrible person!
say more things like that.
I would need an expense account.
and an assistant.
hey! what are you guys doing here? i thought you would be out partying with gandel-worf.
it is gandolf, and he is not coming.
so you have been sittin’ around here all mornin’?
no! i balanced my checkbook.
yeah, and i-i gave first names to all of the foosball players.
i can not believe he did not come!
so what if he did not come! we can still go out and party ourselves!
oh-no, y’know with gandolf we would be out all night!
yeah! we would meet, we would meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
well, we could do that!
there is other stuff too.
we will do it all, and better! look, after tonight, gandolf will want to party with us, dude! come on!
yeah!
yeah!
yeah!!
yeah!!
it is not like we do not know how to party!!
yeah! all right? let us go!
and may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
all right!!
(to chandler) hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
yeah.
well, those were seals, man.
hey mon, little question for ya! how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
okay, the owner of allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead i made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
oh my god!! you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but I am soo happy!
can you believe it? i finally get to run my own kitchen!
ohh, you have waited soo long.
(entering) hey!
hey, pheebs, quick question for ya.
yeah.
how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale’s?
i do not know, it would totally depend on her coloring and… (realizes) you got the job!!
yes!!!
you got the job?! why did not you tell me?
ohh, it is going to be so great! I am going to get to help decide what we sell, I am going to have an office with walls and everything. (turns to monica) I am going to have walls!
okay, is this the day of good news or what? i got us a job! the wedding reception.
ohh! umm, phoebe, i kind of need to talk to you about that. (rachel excuses herself) umm, well i-i-i think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
but we have only had one job.
i know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it is snowballing, y’know?
yeah! what are you saying?
i got offered the head chef job at allesandro’s.
what?
it is okay, ‘because y'know what? you do not really need me for the business.
you are the cook! with out you it is just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!
all right. but umm, i-i-I will pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
for what? i can not believe this! i got to get out of here. (leaves)
phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving rachel alone)
I am an assistant buyer!!
all right, so we will get a little coffee, and get energized, and we will head back out.
yeah, all right.
okay.
so, we are having fun, right?
we do not need that wizard guy. we hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we will head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
I am kind of beat.
actually, me too.
are you serious?!
thank god! I am exhausted!
yeah, but uh, i do not want to be up too late, so uh, I will have a decaf.
yeah, me too.
actually, can i get some hot water with a little lemon? i think i strained my voice screaming in there. does it have to be so loud?
i can not hear a word you are saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
I am just glad i brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? i used them as mittens, i did not want to touch a thing in that last place.
how sad are we?
yeah, i know.
y’know what? we are not sad, we are not sad, we are just not 21 anymore. y’know? I am 29 years old, damnit! and i want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
yeah! and i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends.
and so what if i like to go home, throw on some kenny g, and take a bath!
we are 29, we are not women.
(entering) ohh, here you are. y’know, I am-I am glad you decided to hear me out.
okay, I am hearing.
I have been doing a lot of thinking. a lot! and umm, well, i came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
what?!
or! a bakery delivery person.
i wa-i wa-i wa…
pizza?!
monica!
all right, I have got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I am getting the feeling that you do not want to deliver.
no.
okay. I am guessing that if you do not want to deliver, you probably do not want to pick stuff up either.
no.
y’know what, let us do the catering business.
really?! are you sure?
yeah, y'know i-i made a commitment to you. y’know what, it would be, it would be fun.
oh! it will be fun! ohh! yay! oh! okay, ooh, let us plan the wedding reception. (she grabs the notebook which monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) wow! you really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) y’know what, i want you to take the chef job.
really?!
yeah. that is what you really want. yeah, i do not want to be the reason you are unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and i really do not want to be the reason I am unhappy.
thank you.
besides, it might be kind of fun to form the new a-team.
oh, hi mrs. lynch! is joanna in already?
heard what?
oh my god! how?!
oh my god! oh, i cannot believe it!
oh, god. oh, god. (gets worried) oh god.
yes, so close. mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. but by any chance did joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.
yes-yes, just a few seconds and she would still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?
oh, sophie, i guess you did not hear about joanna…
 umm, i just want to say, uh (reads from a 3 x 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) are you going to kill me?
hey! i just got uh, my teacher evaluations! check out what this one student wrote, "i loved dr. geller’s class. mind blowing lectures! dr. geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
ahh, hotties of the paleontology department, there is a big selling calendar, eh?
who wrote it?
oh, i wish i knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
yeah.
oh, ‘because you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there is your admirer. (ross is stunned.)
a hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he is rain man.
okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
it is a girl! anyway, it wou—it would not matter. okay? because I am a teacher and she is a student.
oh, is that against the rules?
no, but it is frowned upon.
i see.
besides, there is a big age difference.
oh, well think of it like this, when you are 90…
i know when I am 90 she will be like 80 and it will not seem like such a big difference.
no that is not what i was going to say at all. no, what i was going to say is when you are 90 you will still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
hey chandler! y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
oh yeah, dana keystone. she was in my movement class.
what is a movement class?
it is chandler’s way of pretending he did not take mime.
oh well listen, anyway she is directing the new al pacino movie. you got to get me an audition!
oh, i do not know man. i have not talked to her in like ten years.

you do owe me so much. you owe me three thousand, four hundred…
hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? why? will you make the call or what?
oh okay, I will-I will try.

(sarcastically) thank you.
okay.
(entering from the bathroom) hey mon? I am going to check my messages.
you just thought of that in there?
yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
(on phone) hello? (shocked that someone answered.) uh, rachel. (to the gang.) great, someone is in our apartment. call the cops!
you are on the phone!
(on phone) oh my god! oh my god! thank you! (hangs up) that was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
oh my god! how bad was it?
well, he did not say, but it was a fire. I am guessing not very good. come on, we got to go!
come on! (the girls all run out and joey holds up chandler by smiling.)
what are you smiling about? what is so funny?
the part i want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
(startled) yeah?
oh thank you. thanks very much. (leans up against the board and on a thumbtack.) ow! (he pulls away.)
that was you?
oh i, i do not-i do not think that would be the best idea.
what time?
gotcha. (starts to leave.)
oh! so-so seriously, what time?
coming through! (has to dodge a fireman) oh! coming through! (sees a cute one.) oh! hello! hi! (smiles then realizes) no! right! coming through!
oh well, it is not so bad.
oh!
my god! (they both run into the bedrooms.)
(to the fireman) hey buddy, do you think i can borrow your uniform this thursday?
joey! he is working! (to chandler) you would look good in that.
oh, how bad is it?
oh, it is bad. it is really bad. the only thing in there that is not burned is an ass. which i do not remember buying!
how is your room rach?
everything’s ruined. my bed. my clothes. look at my favorite blue sweater. (hold it up.)
is not that mine?
fine! I am sorry for your loss! (hands it back to her.)
(stands up) wow! oh-okay, look pal, i am not in the mood to be hit on right now! but if you give me your number i will call you some other time.
(pulling rachel back down) yes, they can stay with us.
have you figured out what started the fire mr. fireman?
no, not usually. but yeah, i could use one right now.
yes! i do! all the time! i love them! oh my god! i did it! it is me! it is me! i burned down the house! i burned down the house!
okay phoebe calm down, there is no need to place blame. okay? (to the fireman) i warned her about those candles.
god, it is great to catch up! i can not believe how long it is been!
chandler, is that… (mimes someone using a movie camera and chandler nods yes.)
(on phone) oh that is great! good for you.
hey-hey listen… (chandler waves him away.)
okay! so yeah, maybe we can get together umm… (joey mimes throwing something in the air, catching it, rolling it out, putting it in an oven and cutting it.) can you hold for one second please? (to joey) what?!
when you are off the phone, do you want to get a pizza?
(on phone) hi! I am back. (goes to hang up the phone.) yeah, that sounds great. (listens) okay. well, we will do it then. (listens) okay, bye-bye. (he hangs up the phone and turns around to see joey standing close to him and screams.)
hey listen, so when is-when is my audition? i mean i know it is thursday, but what time?
hi.
hey!
(to joey) we did not get to the audition. I am going to take her to coffee and then we will do it then.
ah-ha!
wow! so, now you are going on a date with this girl?
honey, it is not a date! i have not talked to her in ten years! you can not just call up somebody you have not talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. there are rules, y’know? you got to, you got to put in some time.
you are right, I am sorry. it is not like you are y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
no, we only went out once.
you dated her!
not once!
all right, well why do not i go out with an ex-boyfriend and do joey a favor?!
hey, you want to do joey a favor, maybe you go out with joey. (he turns around to see chandler glaring at him.)
(laughs) oh that is great, my friend joey’s in the movie business.
(giggles) my friend’s name is joey.
yeah, I have always hated that howie.
the nerve huh?
refill?
now, this is last minute so i want to apologize for the mess. okay?
oh my god! it sure did not look this way when i lived here.
i know! now look, there is only one problem though. there is only room for one, so i guess one of you will have to stay at joey’s.
well, since the fire was kind of my fault i guess (to rachel) you should get to stay here.
hey! hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault pheebs. okay? it was an accident.
well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
okay! (she jumps on the bed.)
so rach! you are the first guest at hotel monica! umm, you will just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. and i thought i would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. oh, you have been through so much.
i have.
this right here is where i keep the pizza. (he points to the chair.) and uh that is where the napkin is. (points to the floor next to the chair.)
what is that smell?
i know! (shrugs his shoulders.)
what? of course i did! you uh, you sat next to sleepy sleeperson.
oh uh, i had trouble remembering everyone is name, so i-i kind of came up with nicknames. like the guy on the other side of you was smelly von brownshirt.
umm, no. no.
umm, it is cutie mcpretty.
listen, i got to tell ya, i-I am having a great time! y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank i thought it would be too, but it is not. i mean it is not at all.
(pushing elizabeth into a doorway) burt!
so did you sleep well last night?
i did.
yeah?
i did, monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
y’know what joey left on my pillow?
what?
gum!
yeah i know, it was my candle. my candle!
i do not use a curling iron.
well, do not look at me! my hair’s straight! straight! straight! straight!
oh.
this is where i keep the pizza. (it is the same location as before.) and—hey! where did the napkin go?! (the napkin is not in it is spot.)
now there you go! i would not want my best guest to strain her eyes!
thanks monica!
does that smell bother you?
what the smell from joey’s? no, i can hardly smell it over here.
well you let me know if you can, because y’know i can bake a pie to cover it.
i can smell it a little, bake the pie.
okay!
okay.
hello? (listens) oh yes, one minute please. (to phoebe) it is for you. it is the fire inspector.
oh! (takes the phone.) hello? (listens) yeah this is phoebe. (listens) really?!
(in a funny voice) yeah, so it turns out that it was not the hair straightener that started the fire. (rachel prompts him on what to say next.) no-no, it was the candles. it is very not good leaving candles unattended. in fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is… (phoebe suddenly enters.) uhh… uhh… okay. well, i have to go now. (phoebe leaves.)
we had such a great time! she is-she is incredible! i thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it was not. it was not at all. elizabeth is very mature for her age. (joey makes the international sign for big boobies.) (to monica) a concept lost on some people!
so it is okay to date a student.
well, not really. i mean technically it is-it is not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. especially by that professor we ran into last night, judgey von holierthanthou.
well ross, you be careful now. you do not want to get a reputation as y’know professor mcnailshisstudents.
yeah. what-what should i do?
well ross, it seems pretty clear. i mean what is more important? what people think or how you feel, huh? ross, you got to follow your heart.
joey that is so sweet.
(entering) hey.
hey-hey-hey! so, how did it go with dana? any reason i should leave a block of time open say thursday?
i could not do it.
you could not do it?!
hey, relax i just need more time. we are going to dinner tonight.
what?! you are going out with her again!
going out with who?
uh, dana keystone from college.
oh yeah! was not she uh… (does the international sign for big boobies.)
no, that was dana caplin.
joey! you did not even know her!
ah whatever!
great story again! the yarns that you weave! woo-hoo-hoo!
oh no-no-no! stay! stay! because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
oh no-no-no, that is not—no-no-no!
no-no—really?!
(breaking up) well, it just hurts so bad. i uh…
well maybe there is one thing you can do.
well, i umm, i mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but i have this friend. this actor friend and he would kill me if he thought i was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on thursday?
well, the heart wants what it wants. I will see you later. (he runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)
hey! how is it going?
well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
yes it has! i made cookies!
oh that is all right. I am still full from your homemade potato chips.
but you should eat them now because they are hot from the oven.
okay. (reaches for one.)
(pulling the plate back) oh-ho! but not in here! can not eat ‘them in bed, remember? no crumbies!
(gritting her teeth) okay, I will be out in a second.
okay!
(opening the door) what are you doing?
that does not lock does it?
oh, joey! sorry!
no that is all right. do not worry about it.
oh but look! that is going to leave a stain!
rach! hey! it is fine! you are at joey’s!
really?
yeah! look! (he throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
I have never lived like this before.
i know.
all right, do not waste it, i mean its still food. (he picks it up and eats it.)
what do you want to do now? huh? you want to go get a drink?
oh, you have some studying to do?
y’know i remember when uh, when i was in college, we used to… (he sees some of his colleagues enter and puts his head on her lap.)
nothing, I am-I am just, I am so comfortable with you!
what? no! of course, of course i do! are-are they gone?
what?! no! no! wait! you are right, this is stupid. who cares what people think? i mean, i mean we like each other right? there is nothing wrong with that. come on. (they get up and go over to the table where his colleagues are sitting.) burt? lydia? mel? this is elizabeth.
that is right lydia, elizabeth here is a student and uh, we are dating. and you may frown upon that, but we are not going to hide it anymore.
what?
really? its not just frowned upon?
i love it at joey’s!
hey, here you go. (hands her another one.)
(entering, sees rachel’s throw) ni-hi-ice!
thanks!
(to joey) so, you busy thursday?
oh, very funny. i do not know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be thursday. (chandler does not say anything until joey figures it out.) you got me the audition?! let us hug it up! (they hug.)
okay. okay. (joey puts him down.) what are you going to do to me if you get the part?
(entering) hey! hi!
hi!
(to rachel) listen umm, yeah okay, i need to talk to you!
uh-huh.
now i know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but i think I am partly at fault. you see, i did not, i did not tell you but umm, but i-i had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let us just face it, that is just kindling! so i think it is better that i stay at joey’s.
no, no-no-no. phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I am fine here.
okay. oh umm, chandler, monica is looking for you.
really?
yeah she said something about crumbies.
no! no! no! i was so careful! (runs out.)
(to rachel) okay, you have to switch with me! monica is driving me crazy!
that is right, all the ladies want to stay at joey’s.
no! no! phoebe, come on! i do not want to switch! please come on! i can throw wet paper towels here!
no but at monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
i know. I am sorry.
all right fine! this looks like so much fun. (examining the bowl of wet paper towels.)
yeah.
god, what a mess. (she grabs the bowl and heads for monica’s.)
wow! it actually is in the handbook. i can not date you or have a hot plate in my office. i can not believe we have to stop seeing each other.
i know, i know i really like you too. but we-we can not date. it is against the rules. it is forbidden.
what?
really?
well i-i-i do not care how hot it is it is-it is uh, it is wrong.
(feeling it too) no! no! it is wrong! it is-it is-it is naughty. it is taboo.
let us also get a hot plate!
hey!
hey!
so?!
so?
it is thursday! how was the audition?!
wh? monday, one day. tuesday, two day. wednesday, when huh what? thurs—(he gasps in horror.) oh! (runs out and chandler just shakes his head. after a second joey runs back in to grab a piece of pizza and runs back out.)
hey! what are you guys looking at?
oh, it is a poster for that world war i movie that I am in, check it out.
yeah? wow! it looks really violent!
uh-huh! i know. I am coming soon to a theater near you! I am in thx! I am unsuitable for children!
now i cannot wait to see this.
yeah, yeah, it is already generating oscar buzz.
i started that!
i thought i did! oh hey guess what? the premiere is next week and you are all invited! (they all gasp.)
are we going to take a limo?
sure! why not?!
oh i love taking limos when nobody died!
well obviously i will not be able to come, for those of you who have not checked their calendars today is my due date. well y’know, i just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you have been during this time. i really could not have done it without you. and i have loved these last nine months! and even though i am so looking forward to the next part, i am really going to miss being pregnant.
that is right, still no baby! (to monica, joey, and chandler on the couch) come on people! please make some room!
uh sweetie, maybe you would be more comfortable here? (gets up from the green armchair.)
you. like you have not done enough.
look, i-i know how miserable you are, i wish there was something i can do. i mean i wish i were a seahorse. (she glares at him) because with seahorses it is the male, they carry the babies. and then also umm, I would be far away in the sea. (he sits back down.)
god. (sits down.) i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
oh i know, I have been there. i remember toward the end…
(interrupting her) oh phoebe, that is a great story. can you tell it to me when you are getting me some iced tea? (phoebe gets up and rachel groans.) (to the baby) oh god, get out! get out!! get out!! get out!!
let us. (everyone gets up and leaves rachel.)
hey! did you have the baby yet?
do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘because I will do it.
what are you doing here so early?
they sent me home from work. they were like, "start your maternity leave now! just rest, get ready for the baby." well y’know what? screw ‘them! if they do not want me there, I will just hang out with you guys.
or you can do volunteer work.
hello?
one guest? you told me i can have six tickets!
oh my god. so that is it?! i only get to bring one guest?
(to monica, chandler, and phoebe) did you hear that? i only get one extra ticket to my premiere. so some how i have to pick between you three and ross.
(overhearing that) what-what about me?
you said you did not want to go.
i do not. but i would still like to be acknowledged. what? just because I am pregnant you think I am invisible.
definitely not invisible.
well, well ross did not care enough to be here, so i think he is out. you snooze you lose.
he is not snoozing, he is teaching a class.
well then somebody is snoozing. joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, i was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (points to her stomach just above her belly button.)
i have not seen this dress.
star in a movie.
joey, you pick who ever you want. okay? you just listen to your heart. what does it tell you? (mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) phoebe, phoebe.
well uh…i think i want to take chandler.
(still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) phoebe-phoebe-phoebe-phoebe—burrrrr! (mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)
you really want to take me?
yeah! yeah! i mean I am sorry, i wish i can take everybody, but y’know chandler always supported my career. he is paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
so you are never actually going to pay me back?
wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you are going to take him? joey, i do not think you are comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
it is not just the stuff he paid for, i mean it is-it is everything. y’know? he read lines with me. he-he went with me on auditions when i was really nervous, and then he consoled me after i did not get parts that i really wanted. you always believed in me man. even, even when i did not believe in myself.
i always knew you were going to make it. I am so proud of you.
thanks. that means a lot to me.
mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
(in a manly voice) I am going to go shave. (gets up.)
(in a manly voice) yeah well, I am going to go spit. (he goes into the bedroom. on his way out, joey gives rachel a wide berth.)
oh, i have to pee. if i do not come out in five minutes it is because I have choked to death on the potpourri stink. (goes into the bathroom.)
when she comes out, you hold her nose, I will blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.
she is over a week late! she got to have it today, right?
i do not know. i-i think it is still going to be a while.
hmm, care to make it interesting? I will bet you that she will have it by this time tomorrow.
you are on!
okay, how much?
one hundred thousand dollars!
how about fifty bucks?
fine! I will call zurich and move some money around.
(calling from the bathroom) all right, who is turn is it to help me get up!
no one’s here! (monica looks at her.) oh damnit!
this is so exciting! it is so glamorous! people taking our picture. how do i look?
a little tall.
what?
do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that i look taller? (chandler does so) there you go. (and they walk down the red carpet.)
it is just so glamorous.
oh hey mon? rach is here! ohh, you are still pregnant. oh, I am sorry. i know how uncomfortable you are. y’know what? you look great. yeah, like fifty bucks.
oh, i have to go pee. apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (goes to the bathroom.)
damnit! damnit!! here is your fifty bucks! (pays phoebe.)
it is interesting that you lost. now, i forget, do you like to lose?
now stop it! double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
fine! you are on!
okay.
until then, general grant, why do not you set up camp (she puts the bill in her bra) right there.
(entering) hey is rachel here? we have a doctor’s appointment.
she is in the bathroom.
rach, we got to go.
in a minute!!!
people ask me why we are not together, i just do not know what to tell them.
(entering) all right, all right. let us go!
uh, do you want to go change first? the doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…
no, I am fine.
really? you do not think that is a little inappropriate. (she is wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)
good god man do not anger it.
ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am somewhat comfortable.
fine! fine! y’know what? whatever you want. okay? you are the mommy.
oh uh-uh pal! do not call me mommy! it is bad enough you call your own mother that. (he looks at monica.)
I am actually with her on this one.
(onscreen) "i thought i knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along."
(to chandler) okay, this is it. it is my big fight scene coming up. (he looks over and chandler and notices that he is asleep.)
ross.
yeah?
can i ask you something?
uh-huh.
when carol was pregnant with ben…
mmm?
…were you this irritating?
wow!
excuse me?!
oh nothing. nothing! just uh, you have been a little short with me lately. I am not trying to irritate you.
well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
y’know what? the doctor will be in soon, why do not we not speak until then.
(silently) okay. (pause) seriously, breathe louder ross! that is great!
y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that is half human and half pure evil!
hi dr. long, how are you?
(to rachel) oh, you are nice to her.
she has the drugs!
okay. (rachel lies back.)
yeah.
eh, just a tad.
do them!!
well, we are ready to try anything.
okay.
great! we will do all of those.
you have got to be kidding me!
good job joe! well done! top notch!
you liked it? you really liked it?
oh-ho-ho, yeah!
which part exactly?
the whole thing! can we go?
oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
i love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did-did you like that part?
i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic.
you fell asleep!! there was no kangaroo! they did not take any of my suggestions! that is for coming buddy. I will see you later. (starts to walk out.)
do not go! I am sorry. I am so sorry! (sees another guy who is still asleep.) look! this guy fell asleep! he fell asleep too! be mad at him! (looks at him more closely.) or, call an ambulance.
hey!
hey.
hi!
what did the doctor say? any news on when the baby will come?
no. but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
yeah, we tried them all. we went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
well, there is one thing that we have not tried, but someone thinks that, (mimicking ross) "that will open up a can of worms."
well what is it? what is it? if it is going to help bring the baby here, like today. i mean, i think you should do it.
it is sex.
do it!
monica!
I am just saying it is been a really long time for you. i mean, women have needs. do it, get yours!
oh i-i do not know about that. no, i think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
all right, let us be practical, if ross is not willing to do it, he is not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. you can borrow chandler—chandler is good!
monica, what is the matter with you?
nothing. i just want the baby to be born today.
why? why today?
okay fine! i keep betting phoebe that you are going to have the baby and i do not want to lose again!
what?! while she is been going through this hell, you have been making money?! you are betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)
I will take that bet.
what?!
well, I am miserable here! i might as well make some money out it!
can i get some of that action?
wait a minute! now I am betting against all three of you?
oh honey, do not worry. i really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
oh, okay!
hey! sleeping beauty!
where have you been?! i tried to call you! i want to talk to you! i still feel so bad!
(in a baby voice) oh no, were you upset? did you lose sleep?
I am so sorry.
uh-huh look, the only reason i can over here was to settle things between us! okay? you have done a lot for me and my career, i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it! okay, so how much do i owe you?
what?!
give me a number, i do not want to owe you anything!
you do not owe me anything, i do not want you money…
ah-ah-ah! we are doing this! okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. right, how much were those?
i do not know, five hundred dollars?
okay, five hundred dollars. what else?
well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
okay, so that is another five hundred. five hundred and five hundred, that is… (pauses to figure it out.)
do you want a calculator?
please!
here! (hands him one. joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
all right, what else?
well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…
which we are still keeping under our hats!
uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. which after twenty hours of lessons still came out jamaican.
what the hell are you talking about, (in a jamaican accent) "the south will rise again man."
yes, money well spent!
yeah. okay, what else? rent!
okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…
okay. okay, so I am writing you a check for…so you fell asleep during my movie. big deal right? how do you clear this thing?
come on, finish your enchilada.
ross i—we tried all the spicy food. it is not working.
okay here, have one of these peppers. oh ha… oh god! so…so hot! (rubs his eyes.) oh my—(laughs.) by the way, you do not want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
i am feeling nothing. speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
stop it.
oh come on ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! we know what is going to work! it is doctor recommended!
I am sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! my god, I am dying.
oh come on ross, we have done it before we will do it again, it will be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
this is insane, I am not going to make love to you just so that you will go into labor.
make love? what are you a girl?
always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
but you will, you will be performing a service. okay? just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
i love when you talk dirty to me.
oh, i know it. you are right. that is not sexy. oh…oh! (drops a fork on the floor.) whoops! oh, i seem to have dropped my fork. let me just bed over and get it. (tries too, but can not quite seem to make it.) oh god!
okay enough! this is, this is not going to happen.
come on ross! I am miserable here! come on! you started this, now you finish it! come on wuss, make love to me.
y’know what?
what?!
forget it.
oh wow! what now ross you are not going to talk? how on earth will you ever annoy me? oh wait a minute, i know. (mimics his breathing.) i mean you would think the damn jalepeno would have cleared up your sinuses, but no!! that is not enough… (ross jumps over and kisses her.) what are you doing?!
I am getting that baby out of you!
(breaking the kiss) oh god!
oh, i know.
oh no. no-no! i think my water just broke.
i am good. okay! okay! uh, i got the pillow! i got the bag! you got the keys?
okay! i got the keys! okay! okay!
hey!
yeah.
we are having a baby.
i did not uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…
not so much.
okay.
two hundred.
thank you!
that is it. I am done. i do not care when the baby comes, no more betting.
okay.

they are at the coffeehouse.
you know everything!! oh wait, double or nothing. i bet you the baby is over seven pounds. (phoebe is not interested.) i bet you it has hair. (she is still not interested.) i bet you it is a girl.
we know it is a girl! (exits.)
(following her) I will give you really good odds.
you look cute in bubbles.
ehh, you are just liquored up.
hey, it is me! I am comin' in!
I have had a very long, hard day.
ahh, I am going to go get some chicken. want some?
ahh, no thanks. no chicken, bye-bye then.
okay.
you sure? some extra crispy? dirty rice? beans?
for the last time no! get out! get out, joey!
all right!

(entering) hey!
hey, pheebs!
mornin' pheebs!
i have to tell you this story. okay, i was coming over here and this driver…
(interrupting) was his name angus? (monica and chandler laugh.)
what?
oh, he was this cab driver we had in london.
oh. ha-ha-ha. all right, anyway…
wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
uh, the wheatsheaf.
yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! that uh…
bodington's!
ooh! ahh, pheebs, was going to tell a story.
yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—i do not want to talk about it.
(entering) hey!
hey, ross, bodington's!
yeah! (they high-five.)
that was good beer.
ohh…
y'know, I would walk back to london for another frosty one of those bad boys.
y'know, i think they have those at that british pub near the trade center.
later! (exits.)
is not rachel supposed to be back by now?
yeah, but her plane got delayed in athens. but actually, (checks watch) she should be here by now.
oh, so-so you talked to her. did she, did she sound mad?
no, but she likes me. you abandoned her on a plane to greece.
okay, i did not abandon rachel! okay? emily showed up at the airport! i had to go after her! i mean, i-i did what i had to do! she is my wife! rachel is my wife! y'know—emily! emily, is my wife! man, what is that?
so you still had not heard from emily?
no, not since i lost her at the airport.
i can not believe she can out run you man!
hey, she is fast!! okay?!! (chandler is so shocked at ross's outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) oh! you-you think you can be beat me? let us go! outside!!
(entering) hi!
rach, rach, i am so sorry. i am so-so sorry.
oh ross, come on! you just did what you had to do.
that is it? you are not mad? i mean, it must have been terrible.
terrible? hell, i was in greece! that was a nice hotel! nice beach, met the nice people. not to shabby for rachel. (goes and puts her luggage away.)
so, what? that is it?
well, yeah! we are cool. totally cool.
oh, thanks. oh, you are the best. (they hug.)
oh no, you are the best.
(breaking the hug) ohh, i got to go to the flower store! (runs to the door.) check it out, no one will tell me where emily is, so I am going to send 72 long-stem, red roses to emily's parent's house, one for each day that I have known and loved her. that oughta get her talking to me again.
oh, ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, them-i-ly.
rach, that is great! it is so good that you had a good time in greece!
what?! i did not have a good time in greece! ross abandoned me! okay, i could not get a plane out, so i had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "oh, mrs. geller, why are you crying?" i mean, it was sooo humiliating. i felt like such an idiot! i mean, it is all my fault! and you know why, because i make very bad decisions.
oh that is not true.
yes it is! it is true! i went, i went after ross in stupid london.
london is stupid! stupid!
phoebe, you were right. i should have never gone to london, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
oh… no, i did that for someone once and I am not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone is life.
I will do it!
that is fine. so monica, you are now in control of my love life.
okay, i got to go to work.
and uh, rachel, glad to have you back.
pheebs! (he goes over and kisses phoebe, who is also stunned.) always a pleasure. (and he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
oh, rachel, sweetie, look, here is a really cute picture of joey and you at the reception.
ohh, he is married! ross is married. i can not—i still can not believe it. (rachel grabs the picture from monica)
honey, sweetie, by the edges.
i mean, y'know I am just going to have to accept it (she grabs the rest of the pictures)…
ohh. (monica covers her eyes in horror.)
…i mean it is my fault.
sweetie! edges! fingers! smudgey! pictures!
oh my god! (she licks the top picture and hands them back.)
okay. that is okay. i-i know that you are very upset right now. i know, i know that was not about me.
(to chandler) i bet it was about her a little.
if you would stop thinking about ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! i mean, look! look, gunther! (gunther turns to listen in.) i mean, he is nice, he is cute.
yeah, i guess gunther is kind of…
(interrupting) oh, what about that guy over there? (she points at another guy and gunther is deflated.) remember? that is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
oh, i do not know. i do not know.
you are going to talk to him! y'know what? we made a deal, i make your decisions and i say you are going to talk to him.
all right, you are the boss. i guess i got to do what you tell me.
say that to him and you are golden. (she just glares at him.)
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey, pheebs!
we got out pictures back from london. (shows her one.) here is all of us at the tower of london.
(grabs the pictures) oh! here we all are! yeah, there is ross and joey and you and me. (she picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. monica can not watch.)
all right, y'know what, we have been talking about london too much have not we?
no. I am sorry. it is just because i could not be there. because all i ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
what happened?
well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. got myself a date tomorrow night.
see, did not i tell you?! you are getting over ross already!
well…
what took you so long?
i got caught up and work, but I am quitting tomorrow.
oh, good.
so, thanks for having me over! rach. (goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) pheebs. (after a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)
(jumping out of his way) see ya!! (to the girls.) what the hell was that?!
probably some y'know, european good-bye thing he picked up in london.
that is not european!
well, it felt french.
oh god, i really had a good time!
yeah. umm, unless you want to come inside?
okay. oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? i uh, i can not decide this. umm, okay, just hold on a second.
umm, hi!
hi.
is monica around? i-i have to ask her something.
she is doing her laundry.
what is that? (points to the box.)
it came in the mail today, it is uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I have known and loved emily, cut up into mulch!
oh, honey that is awful.
oh, it is not so bad. monica's going to make potpourri! i think I am going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
but, it is not raining.
i can not catch a break!
y'know what ross? you are not going anywhere. you are going to sit right here. I am going to make you a cup of tea and we are going to talk this thing whole out. all right? (she goes out to talk to dave) hey, dave!
umm, listen, I am going to need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. okay? bye! (she goes back in to talk to ross.) honey, listen, i know, i know things seem so bad right now.
(poking her head in) rach? can i talk to for just a minute? i-i dropped some socks.
yeah. (she goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the dropped socks.)
what is the matter with you?! do you want to fall into the trap? do you want to fall into the trap?!
ohh! you did not drop any socks!
i just ran into dave and he told me that you blew him off! i mean, you listen to me! now, I am calling the shots! i say you leave ross alone and go get dave! what the hell were you trying to do?
well, ultimately, i was trying y'know, i-i wanted…tell him y'know, that I am still in love with him.
(gasps) what?!! you cannot tell him that!!
why? why not?! people love to hear that!
i make the decisions, and i say no.
well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you are fired.
you can not fire me. i make your decisions and i say, "I am not fired!" ha!
well… (at a loss for words, she grabs some of monica's laundry and throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow rachel to run back inside and close the door. monica chases her to find that rachel had locked the door.)
rachel!! come on! let me in!
(poking his head out.) having some trouble?
rachel locked the door.
I will kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
rachel! let me in! rachel!
thank you. rachel, can i talk to you outside for a sec?
no.
i really need to talk to you.
well, then talk!
okay, i will. remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
yes!
what thing?
well, rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. which i think is a really stupid idea! it is dangerous, she is never going to get what she wants, and who knows who she might (turns to look at ross) end up hurting.
monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I am going to use the phone. i got to cancel those five giant teddy bears i sent to emily. (looks at the rose mulch.) my god, think of the massacre.
I am going to do it.
all right, rachel, i know-i know you think I am crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. because i bet you, you can not.
but i…
please!
all right, fine.
joey, I am in!
(in tremendous pain) all right. good deal.
uh, okay, pheebs?
yeah?
umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you did not get to go to london and how you were kind of feeling left out?
yeah?
all right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
ohh, that is so nice! how great! well, where? where is the trip?!
well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (phoebe gasps), in central park!
(excited) central…(not so excited) park!
yeah, all of us! all day!
that sucks! that is not a trip! i just came from the park! what are we going to high five about at the stupid central park? "well, it is right by my house, all right!"
well, I am going to go home and bask in the triumph of my central park idea. (gets up to leave.)
(stopping him) hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! ho-ho-hold on a sec there, mr. kissey! y'know, I have been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new european thing you got going on, and i just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and i just—y'know—stop it!
i was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
that is fine, just do not bring it in my mouth.
makes me want to puke! (chandler looks at her, quizzically.)
hey everybody, pheebs is here!
phoebe!
hey, pheebs!
phoebe, woo!
okay, woo! hi.
okay, pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… y'know, it did not have any… it-it, well it blew. so, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, atlantic city!
ooh, atlantic city! oh, that is a great plan! who is plan was that?
mine!
wait! it was my plan.
nooo, i said we needed a new plan.
and, i came up with atlantic city.
which, is the new plan!
okay, well, why do not we all meet upstairs in an hour?
okay! ooh-ahh, I am going to go pack. I am going to go pack my ass off!
come on rach, let us go.
yeah, y'know what? I am-I am going to meet you upstairs in a minute.
no! rachel, you did not find anyone so you can not tell him.
well, y'know what, that does not matter.
okay, rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
yeah, i-i do not care.
okay. i-i can not watch. (leaves as sits down to read the paper.)
what 'cha readin'?
the paper.
yeah, what is it about?
events from around the globe.
okay. uhh, ross, y'know what, there is something that i-that i have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that i should not tell you, but i think they are wrong. i mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
sure. once, at work i-i thought carbon dating was fossilized…
okay, ross, I am really trying to tell you something here.
yeah.
okay.
go ahead.
umm, okay, i think I am-I am just going to-just going to say it. just going to say it. uhh, (pause) I am still in love with you ross.
wow. umm… huh… I am-I am not sure what to do with that right now.
what? what? was that a joke? because it is mean.
(laughing) I am so dead serious. I am totally serious.
why are you laughing?
because (laughs), because, i just heard it. i heard it, and it is ridiculous! i mean, you are married. you are-you are married and it is just ridiculous, and it is like, it is like when said it, i sort of like, i floated up out of my body, y'know? and, and-and then i heard myself say it and then the floating rachel (laughs) was like, "you are such an idiot!"
well, well i am married. even though i have not spoken to my wife since the wedding.
(laughs) I am sorry, that is not funny.
actually, it kind of is. my wife will not return my calls. i do not know where my wife is. (laughs) "hey ross, where is the mrs.?" do not know!
oh god, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that i told you this?
well, i kind of half to. i mean, because the thing is…
the thing is y'know, that you are married to emily.
that is what the thing is.
ross, things are not going to be weird between us, right? i mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
no. no. no, I am-I am glad you did. look, if nothing else, it is-it is always great when someone tells you they love you.
that is what i said! thank you for being so nice. (they hug.)
no thank you for… thank you.
okay, let us go!
atlantic city!
atlantic city, baby! let us roll some bones! hey joey, high-five for rolling bones!
uh, pheebs, you are leaking?
oh my god! you are water broke!
all right. well, do not worry, i call shotgun! (she starts out the door.)
pheebs! we have to take you to the hospital now!
pheebs, pheebs, the babies are coming now.
high-five, the babies are coming! (they all high-five.)
wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (they all high-five again.)
i can not believe phoebe's going to have her babies!
i know, it is beautiful. amazing.
y'know what else i can not believe? i had to kiss phoebe and rachel every time i left a room, i mean it is too bad they did not see us having sex.
do you know anything about women?
no.
that is all right.
okay. (they kiss again.)
wow! this girl is good.
oh-ho yeah! a song with rhyming words. oo, i never thought of that before.
i like her.
(to chandler) why? because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
well, that is pretty much all I am looking for from these people.
(to phoebe) look at you. all jealous.
yeah pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. y'know, she is more..(shakes his shoulders, like he is dancing) y'know, and you are more (sees the look from phoebe and stops)
okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she is done.
oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.
hey leslie, how did you know I would be here?
(to ross) all right listen, i have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I would like know whether that is several big fish or just one big fish.
(to leslie) so ah, phoebe tells us you write jingles.
actually i said she abandoned me to write jingles.
(to leslie) ah, anything we might of heard of?
hmm, bummer.
no. but thanks.
okay. no. but thanks.
(to phoebe) wow, that was kind of brutal.
well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. once you, once you betray me, i become like the ice woman, y’know. very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. (to monica) can i have a tissue, please?
yeah, sure.
no. this is just part of a dare devil game that i play called ‘wait until the last moment before i burst and die.’
jeez, man did you fall..(sees it is a beautiful woman coming out of the men’s room) hi! so ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
(to gunther) y'know what gunther, go ah, go ahead, I am-I am talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) this is the part where you say your name.
ginger. I am talking to ginger, so....
nope, nope, I would just ah, I would rather talk to you. (pause) yes, i do. yes, i do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
where is chandler?
ah, he can not make it, he said he had to his... (sees ginger) whoa-oh! (hides behind the coat rack.)
phew, close one.
hi.
hi, sweetie!
hello.
yeah, huh.
I have got some bad news.
what?
i can get a quick bite to eat, but then i have to come back up here.
come on sweetie! you have had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?
(to rachel) but work comes first! (to mark) oh hey, but that is sad about you though, what happened? burn out? burn all out, did ya?
nooo, he is leaving for a better job.
oh well that is great, so i guess this is ah, this is good bye then. huh? (picks a pad up off rachel’s desk and tosses it into his box) good bye.
okay.
well we are going to miss you around here.
yeah, you bet.
oh. (takes her beeper puts in a pot, covers it, and puts the pot in the oven)
y'know those are a delicacy in india.
yeah, that was leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. that is the twentieth time today! and good luck leslie!
wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
well, yeah. y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our moms worked on the barge together.
oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
you never run on a barge!
(entering) hey.
is ah, is chandler around?
no, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
oooh.
yeah, ginger something.
nooo. no, no, ah, are you sure it was not something that sounded like ginger, like ah, gingeer?
no, it was ginger. i remember, because when he told me, i said, (singing) ‘the movie star.’
aww, man. that is the girl i was hiding from. when she finds out he is my roommate, she is going to tell him what i did.
well, what did you do?
what, oh, oh, oh, no, no, i can not, i can not tell you that, it is like the most awful, horrible thing I have ever done my whole life.
y'know what, do not tell us. we will just wait until chandler gets home, (to phoebe) because it will be more fun that way.
all right!! okay, it was like four years ago. okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her dad’s cabin. just me, her, and her annoying little dog pepper. well that night, i cooked this really romantic dinner....
you gave her food poisoning!?
i wish. no. after dinner, me, her, and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out. so, i picked up a log and threw it on. or, at least what i thought was a log.
oh my god!! you threw pepper on the fire!
i wish. see, i guess another thing i probably should have told you about ginger is that she kind of has a ah, artificial leg.
oh my god! joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
i ran!!
well, that is the best kiss I have had with anyone I have ever met in a men’s room.
(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
yeah, we are going to have to get you out of those shoes.
no, really you are going to freeze.
you are not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
funny book?
hmmm. oh, no, no, i just thinking about something funny i heard today. umm, mark, mark saying ‘I will see you saturday.’
yeah, at the lecture, i told you that last week, you said you did not mind.
oh, no, no, no, it is-it is not the lecture ah, i mind, umm....
oh, please tell me it is not because I am going with mark.
oh, well...
oh my god!!! ross!!
well, I am sorry, but ah, look if you are not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
because, he is my friend.
okay, but do you really need another friend? i mean...
okay, well if i stop playing with joey and chandler, can i play with mark?
is that funny? am i supposed to be laughing?
i do not know, you thought ‘see you saturday’ was funny. look honey, mark is in fashion okay, i like having a friend that i can share this stuff with. you guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
pa-haa!! i would love to go with you.
really!?
yeah, hey i-i have clothes, i even pick them out. i mean for, for all you know i could be a fashion..... monger.
okay. honey, i would love for you to go with me. (ross has a worried look on his face) what?
what should i wear, now I am all nervous.
y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
it is just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she has not called. not that i even care, y'know.
phoebe why do not you just call her? you obviously want to.
you think you know me so well.
well, do not ‘cha want to?
yeah.
okay, well i do know you.
that is what i said.
well so?
i can not. i can not. she dumped me, i mean i totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘okay, bye pheebs’ gone. y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I have ever had in like all my lives.
(singing) i stepped in something icky.
(to rachel) I am really glad we came. (rachel smiles and rubs his arm) you are so pretty. i love you.
oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
(singing) smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? smelly cat, smelly cat, it is not your fault.
oh, yeah!
i..., a jingle? no, no-no-no, no.
okay, well if i was in this for the money, I would be a millionaire by now, y'know. you just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
that is okay. all right, I am going to play song that is really, really sad. it is called magician box mix up. (she turns her guitar upside down to play it.)
(entering) hi!
hey.
oh, can i borrow this? (points to his milk) my milk’s gone bad.
oh, i hate that. i once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
so umm, how was your date with ginger?
great. it was great. she is ah, she is great, great looking, great personality, she is greatness.
sounds like she is got the ah, whole package.
joey told you about the leg, huh?
uh-huh.
oh god, it freaked me out. okay, i know it should not have, but it did. i mean i like her, i do not want to stop seeing her, but every so often it is like ‘hey, y'know what, where is your leg?’ i mean I am the smallest person in the world are not i? I am the smallest person in the world.
(entering from his bedroom) morning.
(to monica) actually he is the smallest person in the world.
(to chandler) heard about the leg burnin’ huh?
it came up.
listen, i ah, i know it is a longshot. but, by any chance did she find that funny?
(entering) so i nodded off a little.
nodded off!! ross you were snoring. my father’s boat did not make that much noise when it hit rocks!
come on! forty-five minutes! forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to professor pitstains and he is ‘hey everybody! remember that thing that is been dead for a gazillion years. well there is this little bone we did not know it had!’
first of all it is professor pittain! and second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but did not fly.
okay, see now, what i just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what i do, i wonder how many people would go see a movie called, jurassic parka.
oh, that is so...
no-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. (makes an unusual sound, then he realises that he still has his jacket on and quickly tries to shake it off, thinking it is alive and attacking him.)
y'know if what i do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? huh? was it so i just would not go with mark?
no. i... i wanted to be with you. i do not know, i feel like lately, i feel like you are slipping away from me, y'know. with this new job, and all these new people, and you have got this whole other life going on. i-i-i know it is dumb, but i hate that I am not a part of it.
it is not dumb. but, maybe it is okay that you are not a part of it. y'know what i mean? (ross looks confused) i mean it is like, i-i-i like that you are not involved in that part of my life.
that is a little clearer.
honey see, it does not mean that i do not love you. because i do. i love you, i love you so much. but my work it is-it is for me y'know, I am out there, on my own, and I am doing it and it is scary but i love it, because it is mine. i, but, i mean is that okay?
sure, i-i-i... (hugs her and mouths no!!)
no. no. actually i forgot, what is the deal with that again?
no. no. i do not think so.
that is-that is my nubbin.
it is kind of a ah, a third nipple kind of thing.
well, y'know two regulars. and ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) ahh, what?
you ah, you have, you have to leave, now? how come?
(to leslie) oh, i thought you were not coming. what? where were you?
okay, do not give me a reason to get mad, okay
no, look, i told you that i did not want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. god, y'know what, i think five years ago i probably would have done anything to play with you but, i can do it by myself. and if i can not trust you then just forget it.
okay y'know what you have to choose. all right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have smelly cat, but we will not be partners. so what is it going to be?
sorry, pheebs.
yeah. you okay?
yeah. i actually am, yeah. y'know life-life’s going to had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. want to hear a new song?
yeah.
we would love too.
okay. (singing) ‘jingle bitch screwed me over! go to hell jingle who are! go to hell go to hell. go to hell-hell-hell.’ that is all i have so far.
(entering, happily) well hello!
where have you been?
the doctor.
is everything okay?
oh yes! just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. yep! two nipples, no waiting.
wow! it is like rachel in high school.

we are a rare breed.
yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.

I am ross, phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.
yeah i really, really need to talk to you about something.
(laughs) no
damn super cuts!
oh no yeah, no phoebe is great, but umm I am an idiot look right before you guys went out i accidentally got her all upset.
yes, yeah i said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please do not blow her off.
well then i did not need to bother you or the four other mike hanagens i bothered.
of course she has. if she would never had a serious relationship I would go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.
yes, yes i did. and i will also say what I am about to say vis-�-vis the following phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. vicrum.
what that is a real name!
(enters singing) oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plane, stop it! why could not they have sent me to texas? 7 of clock maybe I will hit the gym (sits down) who am i kidding pay-per-view porn.
do not disturb do not disturb! monica: (smiles)
 is everything all right?
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise. (she hugs him, and she knows what he was doing so she looks at the tv and sees sharks swimming around thinking chandler was giving himself a treat to sharks.)
 I am going to go freshen up ok
ok honey. that was close.
hello
 hey rach its me ok i just got the chandler's room and i caught him molesting himself.
oh that could not have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
 yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
nooooooooo!
 yes! chandler watches shark porn!
well watching sharks? are you sure that is what he was doing?
 do you know how many times I have seen him jump up like that, believe me i know what he was doing.
man sharks. i always knew there was something weird about that dude. but you promised to love him no matter what.
 what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
ah! you know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can not understand, you know i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and i was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.
 eww are you talking about my bother.
yeah i did not disguise that very well did i.
(enters) hey
(sits down) hi
listen to this... i went out with this girl last night and half way through our date i realized i already slept with her.
so basically you have slept with all the woman in new york and now you are just going around again.
well that is not even the weird part. i do not think she remembered sleeping with me.
 but you do not remember sleeping with her.
yeah but she should remember sleeping with me i am very memorable, you guys know.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.
and who is fault is that.
 what is the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night
hey! i never have an off night ok although sometimes when I am a little bloated i do not feel very sexy but even then I am better then most!
 honey why do not you just let it go and ask her out again.
yeah your both so slutty you do not even remember who you have slept with, you are made for each other.
interesting. all right I will go out with her again and try to get past it (reaches for the chips) oh salt bloaty!
 joey, joey.
what?
 you do not think sharks are sexy do you?
no. (pause) wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
it is open.
hey!
hey! mike called were going out again! yay! yay! (she dances around with happiness)
yay! (he continues the happiness with her by dancing around) quick thing, i went to talk to mike.
what? wha-wha-wha-did you do ross!
oh boy you got mad at that part. i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah, blah, blah, and i ended up telling him that.
what!
umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum.
what! why?
well he seemed to bum hard that you would never been in a serious relationship.
(walks towards ross) if you had not just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
well phoebe, i think you will feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum, his a kite designer (he makes a wow face) and he used to date oprah. (he makes another wow face)
I am not going along with some lie you made ross, no I am just going to be honest with him.
good yeah just be honest with him.
yeah I have nothing to be ashamed of ok so i have not been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. ok i have not had a real boyfriend you know if he can not handle that he can leave. which he will and that is ok. so I will just be alone forever you know alright I will be. it will be fine. it will be fine. I will go walking tours with widows and lesbians. oh (takes a deep breath and sits down, knock on the door)
I will get it
ok
uh huh yeah (stands up) there is just something umm, there is something you should know (pause) vicrum just called.
uh huh, sure, yeah. how can you not remember me?
how could you not remember that we slept together?
i dunno!
come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was (thinks) a certain amount of time ago, i was here you were here, we had sex (starts pointing out the places) here, here, here not there. anything?
my god woman! how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
ooooooooooh, i slept with you! and you obviously remember me hey! i still got it. (turns back to hayley) so were good. (she just glares at him) I will let myself out.
.and i said vicrum you can not just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with rachel.
yeah well (pause) yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee.
i know but he call's and my heart goes to him. you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
oh.
ok i can not do this.
well there is no vicrum, ross made him up because i never really have been in a long-term relationship, I have never lived with a guy, and I have never even celebrated an anniversary so. (pause) if that is too weird for you and you want to leave i totally understand. in fact I will close my eye's make it less awkward (she sits with her eyes closed and mike kisses her, phoebe opens her eyes and like a little child says.) you kissed me.
so you do not think I am a total freak
i guess so, can i. can i think it is cool that you kiss me and also want to kiss you again (they get closer to kiss and phoebe pulls back) and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
(they kiss and the phone rings and machine picks it up, its ross putting on an accent pretending to be vicrum) this is vicrum.
hi honey I am home!
 hi, how was your flight? (she hugs him)
oh it was great.
 here why do not you sit down, get yourself comfortable because i. (monica shows him the tape then puts it in) have a little surprise for you.
well, well, well it must be five in tulsa because it is six of clock in ny.c!
 ok (sits down next to him) this is how much i love you. (she presses play then puts her arm around chandler's neck.)
(chandler looking confused) honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
 is this not the good part? do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
no I am not quite sure you got the right movie that is all.
 oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. or does it always have to be sharks?
does what always have to be sharks.
 honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
what is going on?
 sweetie it is ok, i still love you, let me be a part of this.
let me be a part of this!
 i saw what you were doing in tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
no they do not
 then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat.
oh my god! when you came in i switched the channel, i was just watching regular porn
 really?
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american action.
 i cannot tell you how happy that makes me! (they hug)
you are an amazing wife. (monica shrugs) no really you are amazing you were actually going to do this for me, i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
 I am very, very drunk right now.
(looks at a girl walk in) see ordinarily i would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her? did i not sleep with her?
you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. your in your thirty's and you have never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it does not tern into anything serious.
your right! i love my life! (he gets up to go and speak to the girl and he turns back and sits down) i actually did sleep with her.that is it! you just barge in here, you do not knock
I am sorry!
you have no respect for anybody's privacy!
rachel, wait, wait.
no, you wait! this is ridiculous!
can i just say one thing?
what? what?!
that is a relatively open weave and i can still see your... nipular areas.
oh!!
oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. y'know? like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
oops!
thanks. okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
is not he great?
he is so cute! and he seems to like you so much.
i know, i know. so sweet... and so complicated. and for a shrink, he is not too shrinky, y'know?
so, you think you will do it on his couch?
oh, i do not know, i do not know. i think that is a little weird, y'know? vinyl.
okaaay. (to the guys, on the couch) any of you guys want anything else?
oh, yes, could i have one of those. (points)
no, I am sorry, we are all out of those. anybody else?
okay.
no, she is still upset because i saw her boobies.
you what? wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
yeah, because hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change.
y'know, i do not know why you are so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
nice? they were nice. i mean, that is it? i mean, mittens are nice.
okaaay, (gestures) rock, hard place, me.
whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what did you mean by that?
huh.
uhhuh, how did you know that?
hey you guys. hey, you all know my dad, right?
hey, how long are you in the city?
oh, this is my friend roger.
dad, dad. (shakes his head)
(snatches the phone) hey ma. listen, i made the appointment with dr. bazida, and... excuse me? (to his dad) did you know this is not ma?
sure. so how long you been... (goes back to chopping)
since then?!
...i d'know.
you are one to talk. (puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
oh man. please tell me one of  them is ma.
it is like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. he is like actually some spy, working for the c.i.a. (considers) that would be cool.... this blows!
i know, i mean, why can not parents just stay parents? (she walks over near chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) why do they have to become people? why do they have... (notices chandler) why can not you stop staring at my breasts?
(without looking up) what? (looks up) what?
did you not get a good enough look the other day?
alright, alright. we are all adults here, there is only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you are going to have to show her your peepee.
y'know, i do not see that happening?
c'mon, he is right. tit for tat.
well I am not showing you my 'tat.'
hello?
(intercom) it is phoebe.
c'mon up.
(sarcastic) oh, good. rog is here.
what is the matter with rog?
yeah.
oh, it is nothing, it is a little thing... i hate that guy.
what, so he was a little analytical. that is what he does, y'know? c'mon, he is not that bad.
y'see, that is where you are wrong. why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
why? why would i why? why? why? why?
wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
that that is ridiculous! i do not feel guilty for her failures!
oh! so you think I am a failure!
is not he good?
nonono, thatthat's not what i was saying...
y'know, all these years, i thought you were on my side. but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they would keep liking you better!
hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good!
you are right! i mean you are right! it was not just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace, and and the weebles' cruise ship. oh, which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in.
oh, okay. feel better, rachel, 'kay?
oh, okay. listen, thanks for everything, mon.
you are welcome.
hate that guy! (throws another cookie)
night, you guys.
oh look, it is the woman we ordered.
hey. can, uh, can we help you?
I am joey tribbiani.
uh, joey's having an embolism, but I would go for a nip, y'know?
joey, if i go first, i want to be looking for my keys.
dad, ronni's here.
so, who is up for a big game of kerplunk?
who-ah-ho.
no you will not.
if you go to a hotel you will be...doing stuff. i want you right here where i can keep an eye on you.
that is right, mister, and i do not care how old you are, as long as you are under my roof you are going to live by my rules. and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
now dad, you will be in my room, ronni uh, you can stay in chandler's room.
c'mon, I will show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it is not followed by "no thanks, it is late."
okay. now this is just for tonight. starting tomorrow, you got to make a change. this has gone on long enough.
well, either you break it off with ronni
then you got to come clean with ma! this is not right!
i do not want to hear it! now go to my room!
hey, kicky. what are you doing?
just trying to get comfortable. i can not sleep in my underwear.
well, you are going to.
I have been thinking. y'know, about how I am always seeing girls on top of girls...
are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
y'know what i mean, about how I am always going out with all these women. and i always figured, when the right one comes along, I would be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? now I am looking at my dad, thinking...
hey, you are not him. you are you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
no.
no. you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. now that was not easy, but you did it! and I would like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "no thanks, I am married."
you really think so?
yeah. i really do.
thanks, chandler. (snuggles up to him)
get off!
hi...may i help you?
okay...who are you?
oh, c'mon in.
hi, I am rachel.
bathroom's up there.
hey, listen, ronni, how long would you say chandler's been in the shower?
perfect. fasten your seatbelts, it is peepee time. (she goes into joey and chandler's apartment, where mr. tribbiani is reading the paper) hey, mr. trib.
chandler bing? it is time to see your thing.
(runs out in a towel) what is the matter with you?!
i thought it was chandler!
(comes out of his room) what? what?
you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing!
sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
hey.
how is it going?
good. oh oh! roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
so what is going on?
nothing, um, it is just, um... it is roger.
i dunno, there is just something about...
basically we just feel that he is...
we hate that guy.
we are sorry, pheebs, we are sorry.
uh-huh. okay. okay, do not you think, maybe, though, it is just that he is so perceptive that it freaks you out?
we are sorry.
ma! what are you doing here?
oww! big ring!
hold on, you-you knew?
so then how could you i mean, how could you?!
ma, i do not mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! i mean, what about you?
I am...happy...for you?
ma, I am sorry. i just did what i thought you would want.
yeah. you are ten times prettier than she is.
with this ring? (her engagement ring.) no contest.
nothing, nothing.
it is, i mean, it is nothing, I am fine. it is my friends. they-they have a liking problem with you. in that, um, they do not.
but they do not see all the wonderfulness that i see. they do not see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. they just think you are a little...
intense and creepy.
but i do not. me, phoebe.
you are not? see, that is why you are so great!
so you talked to your dad, huh.
yeah. he is going to keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she is going to keep pretending she does not know even though she does, and my little sister tina can not see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today.
wow.
things sure have changed here on waltons mountain.
so joey, you okay?
yeah, i guess. it is just parents, after a certain point, you got to let go. even if you know better, you have got to let them make their own mistakes.
just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
if i turn into my parents, I will either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I will end up like my mom.
(entering) hey.
how is it going?
oh, okay, except i broke up with roger.
yeah, right.
what happened?
i do not know, i mean, he is a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways i think he is so right for me, it is just... i hate that guy!
hey, joey. what is going on?
clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. next stop: rachel green. (he goes into the bathroom. we hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by monica in a towel)
joey!! what the hell were you doing?!
sorry. wrong boobies.
hello, joey.
what the hell is that?!! (to monica) what the hell is that? is that you? (monica nods her head no, and rachel realizes what is making that sound.) ohhhhhhh! (storms over to chandler and joey’s with monica in trail.)
boy, you are really not a morning person.
(angrily) back off!!! (she starts banging on their door.) get up! get up! get up! god damn it! get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
what is that noise?
you!
it is the chick! she is…going through some changes.
what kind of changes?
well the vet seems to think that is she is becoming a rooster. (the rooster crows.) we are getting a second opinion.
hey!
hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
well, I have been up since six. thanks to somebody is dumb-ass rooster.
you guys you really should get rid of those animals. they should not be living in an apartment.
yeah! especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
all right. I am going to go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I am ready to have frank and alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
now, how will they know if you are ready?
oh, they are just going to umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
oh, i can uh, check that for ya.
okay everyone, think thick.
hi! wish me luck!
oh, good luck.
good luck. (to monica) and I am still right!
that is sooo not true!
what?
she is mad because i know today’s her laundry day and that means she is wearing her old lady underpants.
i can check that for ya.
i just—i can not believe that you think that you and chandler know me and rachel better than we know you.
well… we-we do. you can only eat tic tacks in even numbers.
yeah, what is that about?
(to rachel) and you… ross, i believe, if you check rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
(he does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) you are good. (tries a cookie.) these are not.
I am so not impressed. everybody snacks when they shop.

(singing) "are you in there little fetus?
hey!
oh. oh.
hey, do not mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
all right, i will. no, i will. but umm, y’know just remember that it is still really early, okay so, if it says that I am not pregnant, that does not mean that I am not going to get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so i do not go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.

y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!

i do not know! but maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it will die.
i can not believe we are living here!
what?! what-what is it?!

i can not believe we live here!
(picking up the slip of paper) hello! what is this? oh right its that girl's phone number. (rachel ignores him) yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. (he holds it so that rachel can see it, she continues to ignore him) it is no big deal, i mean it is her home phone number, but...(rachel still ignores him) whoa! (throws it in her lap) whoa-whoops, i almost lost this baby! yeah, the lovely amanda gives me her number and i-i go and drop it. (he waves it in front of rachel's face. then suddenly phoebe has to sneeze and rachel quickly grabs the slip of paper and gives it to phoebe for her to sneeze into.)
thank you.
yeah?
may fifth, why?
oh, mine's december...
ohh, she is pretty. pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she is pretty.
just go up to her and ask her out. (chandler laughs) oh, what is the worst thing that could happen?
i could die.
yeah, it is-it is tough being single. that is why I am so glad i found amanda.
ross, you guys went out once. you took your kids to chucky cheese, and you did not even kiss her.
i tell people secrets. it makes them like me.
(entering) oh.
hey! (phoebe sneezes)
phoebe! you are sick, you should not play. you should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
(in a nasally voice, from her cold) but I am unemployed, my music is all i really have now. well music, and making my own shoes. (she puts her shoe on the table, and it is horribly decorated) pretty, huh? (sneezes)
all right, I am going to do it! I am going to get shot down. any advice?
just be yourself. but, not too much.
(gets up) (softly) wish me luck.
(loudly) good luck!
wish it! (to the woman, kathy, he likes) hi. hi, i-i was just sitting over there, and uhh, chandler. my name is chandler. did i say that?

oh-oh-hey!
hey, come on, give me a break, I am out on a limb here.
hey!
hey! hey, hey-hey, hey. (joey kisses kathy.)
hey, i see you guys already met, huh?
yes-yes, i was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how i could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
did not i tell ya? always showin' off.
before i start, i just want to say that umm, i have a cold, so if i sneeze in the middle of song, it is not on purpose. oh, except the last verse of pepper people. (starts to sing) smelly cat, smelly cat. what are they feeding you? (stops singing) this chick sounds good. (singing) smelly cat, smelly--(stops singing) hey gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
(sees kathy is up watching tv) hi!
jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, i did not expect to have to fight over the remote.
oh my god! that is why i got up too!
hey, listen, I am sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if i would have known you guys were... i never would have...
so ah, joey tells me you two met in acting class.
that is a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
is it on?
hey! (runs over and gets his wonder broom)
oh! it is on! it is on!
there we go little fella.
well the duck can swim.
(singing, drunk) my sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! thanks for the lights honey.
that cold makes you sound so great.
it is fun, god i love how sexy i am. (coughs really loudly.)
oh, kath, we should get going. we are going to by hamsters.
well, have fun!
well, i think it is great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
y'know what, i like kathy.
oh yeah, me too, she is so cool and pretty.
yeah, she is...
she is smart and funny, y'know? we were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
you love her.
no, i do not.
yes, you do. chandler loves kathy.
come on, pheebs lay off him.
thank you, ross.
yeah, he is a little sensitive right now, `because he is so in love.
all right.
all right.
(turning around and doing that, "I am making out with someone," thing with her hands) ooh, umm, oh kathy! kathy, i love you! oh! (she turns around and sees gunther staring at her and stops suddenly.)
so, i need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
uh-huh. oh, yeah, i could write about the time my hair did that "woo-hoo" thing.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey.
(loudly) so I am going over to amanda's tonight!
rachel's not here.
oh.
how is it going with her?
great, actually. I am thinking tonight, maybe the night. yeah, i mean ah, the kids are going to play together and then when they are asleep, I am thinking amanda and i break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
(entering, with a guy) hi guys! this is josh. josh, these are my friends, and that is ross.
hi, josh.
hi.
so, did you play in college? (she points to his nyu soccer (football for the rest of the world) sweatshirt he is wearing.)
ross, did not you ah, play soccer in high school? oh no wait, that is right. you just organized their game schedules on your commodore 64.
okay. (he starts to leave, and rachel grabs him and gives him a passionate kiss.) I will miss you.
wow, cute one!
very!
i know, is not he great? it is so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? there is nothing boring about him, and ah, i bet he is never set foot in a museum.
well maybe he will get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that does not have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
oh! (he bangs his fists together.)
what was that?
monica knows.
it is this dumb thing that ross made up `because he was trying to fool our parents. it is a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. i remember i cried the night you made it up, `because it was the first time that i realized that i was actually cooler than my older brother.
well, I am going to go get ready, (gives monica the fist thing.) for my date tonight, so ah, I will just_ head.
yeah, i should go to, `because I am playing in one hour. hey, (clears her voice and in her normal voice) you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. ooh, (tries to sing) my sticky shoes--eww! eww! i lost my sexy phlegm!
hi!
wow! you-you look great!
(she let us him in) okay! (to her son) hey tommy.
oh no-no-no, it is my pleasure.
what?
i-i-i...
who wants to make some long distance calls?
kathy! kathy! hi!! kathy! kathy! (she does not hear him and keeps running, chandler starts chasing her as the theme to the mod squad starts to play. first, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard splashed on him as he runs by a hot dog vendor.) kathy! (he keeps running and gets tangled up in the leashes of five dogs, in desperation he throws his paper.) fetch! fetch it! (he frees himself and resumes the chase) kathy! kathy! kathy! (he now trips and falls into a pile of garbage, he tries to get up and scream her name again but he has a piece of spinach in his mouth. he gets out of the garbage and starts crossing the street by running over the hoods of a couple of cabs.) kathy! (he jumps in front of her and out of breath he says) kathy.
oh, i just wanted to say, "hey!"
okay. (he walks away disgusted with himself.)
oh come on! you are making it sound worse than it actually was.
her date tipped me ten dollars. (monica laughs)
pheebs, what are you doing?
okay, i want to be sexy again so I am trying to catch a cold. it should be easy, supposedly they are pretty common.
phoebe, you will catch pneumonia.
(entering) okay. you were right. I am in love with joey's girlfriend.
what?!
are you serious?
well, how-how-how is that possible? you barely know her!
i do not know. i can not--i just, i can not get her out of my head. y'know? i mean, I am a very bad person. I am a very, very bad person. I am a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he does not get one) no you are not chandler! we still love you chandler!
(sneezes) oh gosh, phoebe, i think i caught your cold.
you mean you stole it! (monica sneezes again) do not cover your mouth when you do that!
hey.
really?!
yeah-yeah, i told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
(laughs) right in there!
99...100! ready or not, here i come! (he opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) all right, let us go over the concept one more time.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey guys. (to chandler) listen uh, you want to get some dinner with me and kathy tonight?
ohh, umm, y'know what, i already ate.
it is 4:30.
y'know i had a big meal on monday, y'know. so that is just going to get me straight through the week.
okay, i see what is going on here.
you-you do?
yeah! you do not like kathy.
you got me.
yeah, you have been avoiding her ever since we started going out. look, i made an effort to like janice, now i think it is your turn to make an effort to like kathy by going out to dinner with us. right?
yeah. right.
good, and hey! my treat. (he turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) but that is only because you are not eating anything, right?
okay.
(lying on the couch suffering from her cold) ross is not here.
oh. (she tries to walk away from josh, by he keeps holding her) stop it!
yeah! (monica gives a sarcastic thumbs up) (josh leaves) i am soo going to marry that guy. (looking in her wallet) ohhh!
what?
i think he is stealing from me.
why?
because he is stealing from me!
(entering) hi! it is me. and soup. (to rachel) hey, i just saw josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
ughh! (storms out after him)
(to monica) here, now i do not eat chicken, so it is just noodle soup. and there is no chicken in the broth either, so it is really just... noodle water.
thank you so much phoebe.
(picking up monica's used kleenex and putting some in her pocket.) sure.
what are you doing with those?!
but, i need your germs! i want my cold back! i miss my sexy voice.
sorry, phoebe.
it is okay. how is the soup?
umm. (nodding her head, "good.")
ohhhh!! gross!!
is she great or what?
ohh, she is-she is not really my type.
y'know what i think it is? it is the fishnet stockings. y'know? whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
uhh, no-no thanks.
listen, i-I am going to grab a beer. (leaves)
(to kathy) I will be right back. (to chandler) what was that?
what?
kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. i thought we had a deal.
hey, look, what do you want from me?
i want you to like her! but if that is too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
i am pretending.
well then, do it better!
okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her? (joey gives him a thumbs up) no-no it will be good, i can tell her much I have been thinking about her. that i have not stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her. that I am so fantastically, over-the-top, want to-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can not believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
well, that is pretty good. but you might want to tone it down a little.
(entering) hey! so, uhh, amanda just-just dropped me off. yeah, that is one of the things i love about her, she is...uh, she is old enough to drive. (to monica) so uhh, i guess you are not going to mom and dad's tonight?
no, sorry.
well where is amanda?
hey rach, could you get me some cough drops?
i mean y'know, I am thinking. you could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
ross, cough drops, please?
at least i know she is not going out with me to get into r rated movies.
why do not you just marry her? oh no, wait a minute you can not, I am sorry i forgot, she is not a lesbian.
you see amanda and i have a very special...
(interrupting) you have nothing! you are not even going out! you are her baby sitter! you have a 12-year-old girl's job!
(laughing) ohh, that is soo sad.
and what are you laughing at, miss `my-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! at least he bought me something with it! (shows her, her ring)
that is mine!! now, would you both please start acting like adults? and get me my cough drops!
fine.
sorry.
here. (hands her, her cough drops) (to rachel) at least i made ten bucks in my relationship.
y'know...
(singing) platting goats are platting. platting down the street. platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to gunther) does it even work without my sexy voice?
gunther, kiss me.
(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `little general.') hey! (chandler turns down the tv) now, we are not actually going to be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
can i sleep on your couch?
(singing) and I am still waiting for my paper mache man. thank you my babies.
yeah.
no!
(confused) okay.
(really confused) okay.
and here is little ben nodding off...
awww, look at aunt monica's little boy!
oh, look, he is got ross's haircut!
oh, let me see! (grabs picture) oh, god, is he just the sweetest thing? you must just want to kiss him all over!
(quietly) that would be nice.
pardon?
nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. pffft. pffffffft. (walks over to where joey is seated)
hey, chan, can you help me out here? i promise I will pay you back.
oh, yeah, right, ok... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
i will, really. I will pay you back this time.
(sigh)... and where is this money coming from? (gives money to joey)
well... I am helping out down at the n.y.you. med school with some... research.
(overhearing) what kind of research?
oh, just, y'know.... science.
science. yeah, i think I have heard of that. (everyone is interest is piqued, they all look over)
(sigh)... it is a fertility study.
oh, joey, please tell me you are only donating your time.
alright, come on you guys, it is not that big a deal. really... i mean, i just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, i get seven hundred dollars.
hey.
wow, ooh, you are going to be making money hand over fist!
ok, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
we have got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... (hands meat to monica)
(in a deep voice) men are here.
we make fire. cook meat.
then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
oh joey, melanie called, said she is going to be late.
oh, ok.
so how are things going with you two? is she becoming your (provocatively) special someone?
i do not know, she is, uh.... she is pretty great.
yeah? what does she think of your little science project?
what, you think I am going to tell a girl i like that I am also seeing a cup?
man's got a point.
well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
crazy bitch.
yeah, well, i still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if i want to get the money I am not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what i mean.
joey... we always know what you mean.
hey.
hey.
hey. (phoebe sees his bags)
how long did you think this barbecue was going to last?
I am going to china.
jeez, you say one thing, and...
you are going to china?
yeah, i-it is for the museum. someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they do not want us to have the bone, so I am going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it is—it is a whole big bone thing. anyway, I am going to be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you want to reach me, y-you can not. so here is my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to monica). um... here is a picture of me... (hands it to monica)
oh, let me see! (takes the picture)
(to monica): could you take it to carol's every now and then, and show it to ben, just so he does not forget me?
yeah.
hi, ben. I am your father. i am... the head. aaaaaahhhh.... (puts picture down, sees ross staring at her) alright, this barbecue is going to be very fun.
hey, is rachel here? um, i wanted to wish her a happy birthday before i left.
oh no, she is out having drinks with carl.
oh. (pause) hey, who is carl?
you know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
no.
oh, well, see, there is this guy she met at the...
at the coffeehouse, right.
so you do know who he is! (laughs, ross stares at her) sorry.
ok, I am going to go say goodbye to the guys.
oh, hey, y'know what? tell them that bone story.
hi.
hey!
hey!
(sigh)....i have to go to china.
the country?
no no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. do you guys know who carl is?
uh, let us see... alvin... simon... theodore.... no.
well, rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
oh no! how can she do that when she is never shown any interest in you?!?
forget about her.
he is right, man. please. move on. go to china. eat chinese food.
course there, they just call it food.
yeah... i guess. i do not—i do not know. alright, just... just give her this for me, ok? (gives chandler a gift for rachel)
listen, buddy, we are just looking out for you.
i know.
we want you to be happy. and i may only have a couple beers in me, but... i love you, man. (joey gives ross a hug)
I am still on my first. i just think you are nice.
like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
(sarcastic) ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at joey's stupidity)
(gets up) ok, how does everybody like their burgers?
oh, no, no, no. presents first. food later. (walks into living room)
hey, hold on there, tiger. how is it going? how you holding up?
well, not so good. she definitely thinks tonight is the night we are going to... complete the transaction, if you know what i...
then you do. heh, heh.
so, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
what do you mean?
y'know, just be there for her.
not following you.
think about it.
ok, I am guessing this is from...
well, thank you, melanie.
(pointing out a gift) ok, this one right here is from me.
(picks it up) ok... ah, it is light... (shakes it)...it rattles... it is... (opens it) travel scrabble! oooohhh, thank you! (she gives it back to him)
this one's from joey... feels like a book. thinks it is a book... feels like a book. and...(opens it)...it is a book!
oh, it is dr. seuss!
(to rachel): that book got me through some tough times.
yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he will die.
who is this from?
oh, that is ross's.
oh... (opens it)... (sees it is a pin) oh my god. he remembered.
remembered what?
it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can not believe he remembered!
well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his travel scrabble game)
oh, it is so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune.
i can not believe he did this.
come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
what did you just say?
(panicked) ahem... um... crystal duck.
no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
(stuttering incoherently) f-hah.... flennin....
oh.... my god.
(rubbing his temples) oh, no-no-no-no-no....
(pats chandler on the leg) that is good, just keep rubbing your head. that will turn back time.
i mean, this is unbelievable.
i know. this is really, really huge.
no it is not. it is small. it is tiny. it is petite. it is wee.
nuh-uh. i do not think any of our lives are ever going to be the same ever again.
ok, is there a mute button on this woman?
i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross! d-did you have any idea?
no! none! i mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so i just... (to joey): w-well, what else did he say? i mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
well, given that he is desperately in love with you, he probably would not mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
ross? all this time? well, I have got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)
(quickly) h-he is in china!
the country.
no, no, wait. (checks ross's itinerary) his flight does not leave for another forty-five more minutes.
what about the time difference?
from here to the airport?
yes! (rachel walks towards door) you are never going to make it!
rachel, what are you going to say to him?
i-i-i do not know.
well then maybe you should not go.
he is right, because if you are just going to, like, break his heart, that is the kind of thing that can wait.
yeah, but if it is good news, you should tell him now.
i do not know. maybe I will know when i see him.
here, look, alright, does this help?
noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. i mean, this is just too big. y'know, i just, I have just got to talk to him. i... i got to... ok, I will see you later. (opens door)
rachel, i love you! deal with me first! (she leaves)
(something in chinese)
ni-chou chi-ma! (walks onto jetway)
ross! excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
hi.
oh, no, no, i do not have one. i just need to talk to my friend.
no, i know, but i—he just went on. he is right there, he is got the blue jacket on, i... can i j-just...
ok, alright, ok, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? please? this is very important.
uh... i do not know.
heh, heh. it was nothing.
(panicked) uhhh.. y'know what? forget about me. let us, uh... let us give you another turn.
sure! why not?
how do you mean?
uh, so, uh, rach, uh... do you want to save this wrapping paper, i mean, it is only a little bit torn... so are you going to go for it with ross or should i just throw it out?
i do not know. i do not know... i thought about it all the way there, and i thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it is ross. y'know what i mean? i mean, it is ross.
i do not know, i mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I am thinking... oh, I am thinking it would be really great.
oh my god, me too! oh! oh, we would be like friends-in-law! y'know what the best part is? the best part is that you already know everything about him! i mean, it is like starting on the fifteenth date!
yeah, but, y'know, it is... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
another good point.
no, i mean, i mean, when you are at the fifteenth date, y'know, you are already in a very relationshippy place. y'know, it is... you are committed.
(confused) huh?
well, i mean, then what happens if it does not work out?
why is not it working out?
i do not know... sometimes it does not.
is he not cute enough for you?
no!
does he not make enough money?
no, I am just....
maybe there is someone else.
wha...
is there? is there someone else?
no! there is.. there is noone else!
then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
hey, big...
shhhh!
(quietly) ...spender.
she is still asleep.
so how did it go?
oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you are great in bed?
the fact that you would even ask that question shows how little you know me.
well, it is like, last night, i could not do the thing that usually makes me great. so i had to do all this other stuff. and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. it is like, all of a sudden, I am blind. but all my other senses are heightened, y'know? it is like... i was able to appreciate it on another level.
i did not know you had another level.
i know! neither did i!
hey, great skirt! birthday present?
yeah.
oh, from who?
from you. i exchanged the blouse you got me.
well, it is the thought. hey, does not ross's flight get in in a couple hours? at gate 27-b?
uh, yeah. uh, monica, y'know, honey, I have been thinking about it and I have decided this—this whole ross thing, it is just not a good idea.
oh, why?
because, i feel like i would not just be going out with him. i would be going out with all of you. oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and i do not want to...
(gets up) no, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you are already so...
i am not 'so'! ok, i was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I will be good. i promise.
who is it?
c'mon up.
behind my brother's back? (rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you will not be hearing from me.
seven hundred bucks!
alright, you did it! do we have any fruit?
man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something.
really? so, you are going to stick with this 'it is all for her' thing?
what, are you crazy? when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)
i can not believe you would rather go out with him than me.
would you excuse me, please? I am trying to have a date here.
fine, just stop thinking about me.
can not do it, can you?
so I am thinking about you. so what?
i do not get it. what do you see in this guy, anyway?
well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
rachel, come on. give us a chance.
ross, it is too hard.
no, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? who cares about them. this is about us. look, i-I have been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
ross, you are like my best friend.
i know.
if we broke up, and i lost you...
whoa, whoa, whoa. what makes you think we are going to break up?
well, have you been involved with someone where you have not broken up?
(pause) no. but... it only has to happen once. look, you and i both know we are perfect for each other, right? i mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
i do not know... i mean, I have never looked at you that way before.
well, start looking.
wow.
right! you are right!
you know what?
i forgot... i am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. i am so sorry! I am so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) i mean—I am sorry. i-i-i got to go. I am sorry.
(sifting through crowd) excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. hi.
oh, hey, hey, i got that.
no problem. i cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
yeah.
no, no, they will. i just... uh...
come on, they are going to love you.
do you think that there is a town in missouri or some place called sample? and ah, as you are driving into town there is-there is like a sign, and it says “you are in sample.” (he says it like urine sample.)
(entering) hey.
how did it go with pete?!
tell us!
you are not going to believe this. okay, so i go over...
so guys, listen, i go over there, and umm...
all right, so, so you went to pete’s...
what happened?
(robin is speaking loudly again) i...
forget it. (they all turn and listen to billy and robin)
(to billy) so you are the gynaecologist?
so monica, what were you going to tell us?
(pause) i have no idea.
so, come on, what was the big news pete wanted to tell you mon?! or should i say mrs. monica becker?
no-no-no oh, keep your name, do not take his name.
he did not ask me to marry him.
well then definately do not take his name.
he wanted to tell me he is going to compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
why?! what is it?
i do not know exactly. it is-it is sorta like wrestling.
(intrigued) oh?!
yeah, but without the costumes.
(disappointed) oh.
and it is not fake, it is totally brutal.
yeah, it is two guys in a ring, and the rules are: “they are are no rules.”
so you can like, bite, and pull people’s hair and stuff?
yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
what is fish hooking?
huh, what is fish hooking... (joey sticks his finger in ross’s mouth and pulls on his cheek, y'know like when you hook a fish.) (to joey, sarcastic) thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. what is that taste?
what? my hands are totally clean, i just gave the duck a bath.
yes, but there is two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
oh it is bing, sir. I am sorry , i was just ah...
(on phone) that is right, ryder. wynona ryder for six. (listens) thank you. (hangs up) (to the gang) yeah, we have the reservations.
yes!!
all right buddy, way to go! (smacks him on the butt)
(stunned) dude, what are you doing?
thank you! today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
yeesh, what did you do about it?
well, i did not do anything. i did not want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
i got to tell ya, i think it is okay to be that guy.
yeah, maybe it is like y'know, that jock thing. y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. (pats ross on the butt)
y'know i do not, i do not understand guys, i mean i-i would never congratulate monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin’ her boob.
yeah, i know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between ‘them.
okay, can we please go eat?
yeah. what are we getting?
(to chandler) anything but stew.
all right so, chandler, from now on, do not give your boss a chance to get you. y'know just ah, do not turn your back to him.
yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. y'know? what you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking aloud) now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
(to ross and monica) what if joey were president?
umm, hey rach, can i ask you something?
yeah.
okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if i set ross up on a date?
oh, ah with who?
umm, my friend, bonnie. she just always thought ross was really cute, and now that you two are not together, she asked if i could set it up, but if you are not cool with it...
oh-oh-oh, which one is bonnie again?
you remember her from my birthday party two years ago. she is yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
oh! (laughs) that is fine.
great! okay, good for you! (as they leave she slaps rachel on the butt)
(entering) hi!
hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. i-i do not want you to get hurt, ‘because i kind of like you.
promise me you will be careful.
hey, are we still on for tonight?
okay, good, ‘because umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
how ‘bout just a boom?
(to phoebe) well that was depressing, i think i just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from fame. ready to go to the movies?
um-hmm. oh wait! this is bonnie. (who has hair by the way)
this is bonnie? (to phoebe) this is bonnie? (to bonnie) you are bonnie?
oh no, I am sorry, you look a lot different from the last time i-i saw you.
oh, that must be it.
(to bonnie) well i hope you have fun tonight.
(to phoebe) you said she was bald.
yeah, she was bald, she is not now.
how could you not tell me that she has hair?
i do not know, i hardly ever say that about people.
(looks in the window) ohh, well, this is just perfect!
well I am sorry, i thought you said it was okay.
yeah, i said what was okay when i thought she was some weird bald chick. i mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
well, maybe it will not work out. maybe ross will not like her personality.
why, does she have a bad personality?
oh no, bonnie’s the best!
(to his co-workers) what is with him?
well, that is not true, he-he smacked you once.
no sir.
(walking up with this huge tub-of-popcorn and drink) hey!
god ross, what is that?
yeah, it is the ultimate fighting combo. yeah, i saved thirty cents, plus i get to keep the cup. yay!!
i love you, pete!!!
(going up to the ring) pete! pete!! that guy’s pretty huge!
well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
all right! you go get him! let us go!
hey! (she sits down next to him) it is me. mon-i-ca! can i just tell you how proud i am of you.
i mean i-i thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. and now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
well, you are not going to get going are you?
well, no. but...
that guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
you did not know that already?
okay, just get a lot better. (pause) fast.
yeah. that-that was the problem.
(joining them) hey.
hey! how long until pete’s fight?
oh, about five minutes. right now they are interviewing his opponent. apparently he trains by going to iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
hot dog?
four, please. (ross looks at her) I am really nervous. (ross gives her the four dogs) thank you. (she grabs four buns, and heads back inside)
so ross, how umm, how did it go with bonnie?
what? oh! i got to tell you, i-i was not expecting to like her at all, i mean i actually was not expecting to like anyone right now, but she is really terrific.
ohh, that is too bad!
no, i-I am saying i liked her.
yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
pheebs, i think she is great. okay? we are going out again.
okay, i hear you! are you capable of talking about any thing else?
(joining them) hey! which one’s my turkey burger?
ahh, the one next to my foot. sorry.
(sticking his head out the window) hey, the fight’s starting!
okay, we will be right in. (to chandler) so ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
nine times! okay, i had to put on lotion! but, it is going to be okay, because as of tomorrow I am conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
(sticking his head out the window) fight’s over!
excuse me, doug? (no reaction) hey there sports fan!!
no, i ah, i did not do them.
no, no i just ah, did not do them. instead, i ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly do not deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
doug!!
I am a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
no, no. it-it is not about the swearing, it is more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
oh, and do not get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment. it is just that i, i have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it is making all the other guys jealous.
okay. (he starts to leave)
ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
okay. would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
(seeing ross and bonnie inside central perk) oh my god! phoebe look, it is ross and that girl.
no! no! look at that! (drags her away from the window) it is a line of ants! they are working as a team!
phoebe! (goes back to the window)
(looking in the window) right, oh yeah. wow, oh, it looks like ross is breaking up with her. uff, i hope he let us her down easy. let us go.
come on phoebe, look at that! they are not breaking up, look at them. okay that is, you know what that is? that is a, that is a second date, that is what that is! look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
oh no! that really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
ohh! (walking away from the window) phoebe, this is all your fault! now he loves her, he is going to marry her, and this is all your fault.
you said it was okay!
you said she was bald!!
what?! what-what-what-what-what?!!
phoebe, we can not, we just can not just let it happen! okay, we have to do something! we have to break them up! okay? just go in there and like, shave her head! you owe me one bald girl!!
okay, first of all, breathe. second of all, i do not get it. are not you the one that decided that you did not want to be with ross?
(quietly) yes.
well is not he your friend? do not you want him to be happy?
yes.
so?
i just y'know, i did not expect him to be this happy so soon. ufff. ooo-ooh! (sits down on the curb)
(sits down next to her and hugs her) oh no.
what?
oh, we killed them all.
oh!
please tell me you are stopping now.
you are insane! you-you got to give this up!
sit down. all right? please, just listen to me. you are terrible at this! okay? you are the worst ultimate fighter ever! ever!!
well then, y'know what? i care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. so if you have to do this, then you are going to have to do it without me.
then I have got to go. bye. (kisses him and starts to walk out)
yes?
thank you, sir.
no. no, not at all, that is-that is ridiculous.
ye-ye-yeah, yes i do!
run! run you crazy, rich freak!
oh, i can not watch this. (turns her eyes away)
check it out, he is winning! (to monica) pete’s winning!
really?!
no-of-of!!
wait, if that is his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
well, this is ironic. of your last two boyfriends, richard did not want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now pete can not.
(voice over) previously on friends.
i mean, i do not feel like i even have a girlfriend anymore.
you want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you have got a girlfriend?
is this about mark?
(shocked) oh my god.
okay, it is not, it is not.
oh my god. i cannot keep having this same fight with you ross! look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
fine, you are right. let us ah, let us take a break, (goes to the door) let us cool off, okay, let us get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)
no. a break from us.
then, we had this big, stupid fight, and i said i wanted to take a break, i do not want to take a break.
(on the phone) I have been thinking, this is crazy, i mean do not, do not you think we can work on this?
who is that?
nobody.
is that mark?
umm, honey, look he just came over to....
yeah! got it! (slams down the phone)
hey.
hey.
how is the big anniversary dinner?
well, we never actually got to dinner.
ohhh, nice.
no, we kind of broke up instead.
what?! (she accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)
(looking up at the ceiling) god, monica it is on the ceiling.
that is okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! you broke up?!
yeah, but it is okay, because when ross left mark came over.
oh no!!
no.
rachel, you and mark?!
no, no-no, it is okay, calm down. mark and i talked, and i realised how much i love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but i really want to make it work.
(on answering machine) hi, it is me. I have been trying to reach you all night. i feel awful. please, ross, you got to know there is nothing between me and mark. this whole break-up thing is just stupid.
yeah!!
eh, I am just so sorry i put you through it. and, i y'know, i do not want to get back together over a machine.
na-huh.
so, i love you.
i love you.
and y'know what, I am going to, I am going to go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I am going to stop by around 8:30.
okay. (ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
bye.
chloe, chloe how is it coming?!!
umm, oh, hey, i do not know. how about a big one?
well then a small one!! listen, let us, we kind of have to get going!
you, you sure you need shoes? (chloe nods her head) okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)
yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend i told you about last night? (he is frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. oh, i found it!!
yeah!
yes, yes i am, one of the many things I am feeling. well.... (picks up her coat)
oh, thank you. (she goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) hey, hey. (opens the door, sees rachel, and hides chloe behind the door) rachel!!!!
hi. ohhh, you got my message.
yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
so what do you say? can i be your girlfriend again?
yes, you can, very much.
(seeing the thumbs up) ahhhh!! (hugs rachel tighter.)
hey!
hey.
hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
oh, there is banana on it.
wow, i have the spirit of an old indian women living in mine.
so then you know? (phoebe nods her head)
the mailman was downstairs, so i brought up your mail.
oh, good. thanks.
now what is fabutec?
okay, all right do not judge me to much. okay? um, but i saw this info-mercial, and um, i swear to you i have never-ever bought anything on tv before, except for this mop. but there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
waxine!!
yes! have you seen it?
oh, it is incredible! i so want to be a waxine girl.
i know!!
god. do think it really does not hurt? ‘because how can they do that?
hello! organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
they have the best stuff in there.
oh my god! oh my god!
yeah. we figured when we could not find you, you would gone home to make up with rachel. which is probably what you shoulda done. huh?
you think?! god, i, ah, I am in hell. i mean what, what am i going to do? rachel’s all like, ‘i love you and, and let us work on this.’ and all i can think about is, ‘what is she going to do? what is she going to say?’ when i tell her what i did.
well, before we answer that, i think we should address the more important question. how dumb are you?
what?! look, we are trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. how am i supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
look, ross look, I am on board about this totally honesty thing, i am, just not about stuff that is going to get you in trouble.
he is right. nobody’s going to benefit, and you are just going to hurt her.
yeah, and there will not be a relationship left to rebuild.
yeah, but do not you think....
all right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. and that is what deathbeds are for.
yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)
all right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she does not find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that ross is facing him) did you think about the trail?
what trail?
(stomps on the footrest which pops ross up into a sitting position) the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) you always have to think about the trail!
oh, i-i do not think there is any trail.
okay, okay-okay, ah, chloe works with that guy issac. issac’s sister is jasmine. and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe. and phoebe’s friends with rachel. and that is the trail, i did it!
(reading from the instructions) after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
did that!
grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
okay. (does so.) ow!!!!! ow-oh-oh!
was it not pain-free?
no. it was painful. oh my god , they should call it pain-zine, now with a little wax.
huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial do not seem to think it is that bad.
that is because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. but hey, y'know if you do not believe me, please, by my guest.
(removing one of the strips) ow-ow-ow-ow! oh my god!!!
now, are you glad we did not start with the bikini strips?
(entering) chloe? hi..
you took my watch?
just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
exactly. so you did not, did not mention anything to issac right?
you tell, of course you do. issac. issac. hey, issac. issac, hi! y'know we have not actually met...
yes, i suppose i am a dog. but issac, see i-i happen to have a girlfriend.
yeah, that is the one. listen, i do not want to hurt her.
yeah. listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
actually, no, we are not.
no, we are not.
no, we are not!!
right.
fine. i just need to know that you are not going to tell your sister.
(entering out of breath) jasmine?
we met at phoebe’s birthday party, I am, I am ross geller.
yes, i did.
very bad.
I am agreeing with you. did you, listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet?
okay, jasmine, please, please do not. i love my girlfriend very much, and i want more than anything to just work it out with her. okay?
thank you, thank you.
(angrily) who is your roommate?
gunther! gunther. gunther, please tell me you did not say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place.
ow!
oh!!
ow!! ow!!
ow!!!
we are all right.
it is okay, it is okay.
we are all right.
we were just waxing our legs.
off?!!
for your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
yeah, well i do not think you can make that statement, unless you have been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely.
yeah, i-i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that is all. i mean, come on, it is just a little wax.
oh yeah, come here. (puts a little wax on joey’s arm and puts a strip on it.)
oh, that is mature.
okay, fine, so now what, i just pull it off?
uh-huh.
that is right.
(forcing the door open) come on, rachel, come on! talk to me! please!!
i can not talk to you. i can not even look at you right now!
what?
nothing, nothing.
(going over to listen at the door) rachel said everything was okay.
(to joey) what, what are they talking about?
rachel?
just get away from me!
no, it was a mistake! i made a mistake! okay?
a mistake?! what were you trying to put it in? her purse?!
whe-where did he put it?!
ross, you had sex with another woman!
oh my god.
oh, i knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
yeah, well, i guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
oh!! (hits chandler and joey in the head) you guys knew about this and you did not tell us?!
(to joey) he has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
(opening the door) y'know what, i want you to leave! get outta here!
no!!
just get out! now!!
no!! no!! i want to stay. i want to talk about this.
okay! all right! how was she?
uh-oh.
what?
was she good?
do not answer that.
come on ross! you said you wanted to talk about it, let us talk about it!! how was she?
she was...
awful! horrible!
she was not good. not good.
she was nothing compared to you.
she, she was different.
ewwwww!
uh-oh.
good different?
nobody likes change.
what? okay, okay, okay, okay.
should we do something?
yeah, never cheat on rachel.
I am sorry, okay, I am sorry. i wa-i was disgusted with myself, and this morning i was so, i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy, and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
whoa!! whoa, whoa, wait a minute. what time did your little friend leave? (ross can not answer that) oh my god. she was there? she was still there? she was in there, when i was in there?!
listen. oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
look, i did not think there was a relationship to jeopardise. i thought we were broken up.
we were on a break!
that, for all i knew would, could last forever. that to me is a break-up.
you think you are going to get out of this on a technicality?
look, I am not trying to get out of anything, okay. i thought our relationship was dead!
well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
y'know what, i do not think we should listen to this anymore. (goes to open the door)
(stopping him) what, what are you doing? you can not go out there.
why not?! (to chandler) I am hungry.
because they will know we have been listening.
god! and to have to hear about it from gunther!!
come on! like i wanted him to tell you, i ran all over the place trying to make sure that did not happen!
oh, that is so sweet. i think I am falling in love with you all over again.
y'know what, i think we can go out there. i mean they have more important things to worry about.
yeah, we will be fine.
look rachel, i wanted to tell you, i thought i should, i-i did, and then chandler and joey convinced me not to.
(handing monica the wax) wax the door shut, we are never leaving, ever.
hi, it is phoebe. listen someone is going to have to take my 9:00 with mr. rehack, ‘because it is like 9:15 now, and I am not there.
do not you realise none of this would have ever happened if i did not think at that same moment you were not having sex with mark?
all right. let us say i had slept with mark. would you have been able to forgive me?
(pause) yes i would.
you would be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
(less sure) yes.
you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
(covering his ears and screaming) la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! okay, okay, yeah, i would have been devastated but, i would still want to be with you. because it is, i mean it is you.
what? come on rach, tell me what you are thinking?
I am thinking, I am going to order a pizza.
order a pizza like, ‘i forgive you?’
oh man, pizza? i like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to rachel) put olives on the pizza.
we could eat the wax! it is organic.
oh great, food with hair on it.
no, not the used wax.
because that would be crazy?
hey, can i, can i get in on that? because I am kind of hungry myself.
fine. (on phone) hi! yes, I would like to order a large pizza.
no anchovies.
with ah, extra anchovies.
that is okay, I will just pick ‘them off.
yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
you can have the last piece, if you want.
well, i should think so. you slept with someone.
they are going to get through this, are not they?
yeah, come on, it is ross and rachel, they have got too.
what if they do not?
you think i need a new walk?
what?
well y'know, I have been walking the same way since high school. y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. i think i need a ‘take notice’ walk.
are you actually saying these words?
what, now you are not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) look rachel, i-I am sorry, okay, I am sorry, i was out of my mind. i thought I would lost you, i did not know what to do. come on! come on, how insane must i have been to do something like this? huh? i-i do not cheat right, i, that is not me, I am not joey!
whoa-ho-ho! (he looks at chandler, who gives him a ‘come on’ look.) yeah, okay.
hey. it is three in the morning. they do not know that I have come home yet. you notice how neither one of them are wondering where i am.
yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
y'know what, y'know what, I am-I am not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. you are the one that bailed on us. you are the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
that is....
that is what?!
that is neither here nor there.
okay, well here we are. now we are in a tough spot again, rach. what do you want to do? how do you want to handle it? huh? do you want to fight for us? or, do you want to bail? (sits down next to her) look, i, (on the verge of tears) i did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. okay? and I am sorry, i wish i could take it back, but i can not. (we see monica and phoebe are almost in tears.) i just can not see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. rachel, i love you so much.
no ross!! (stands up and moves away from him) do not! you can not just kiss me and think you are going to make it all go away, okay? it does not work that way. it does not just make it better. okay?
okay, okay, okay.
(softly) i think you should go.
what?
(softly) i really think you need to go now.
(moving over to stand in front of her) okay, okay. this morning you said there was nothing so big that we could not work past it together...
yeah, what the hell did i know!
look, look, there is got to be a way we can work past this. okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) i can not imagine, i can not imagine my life without you. (both of them are starting to cry.) without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. your good heart rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....
(crying) no. i can not, you are a totally different person to me now. i used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. god, and now i just can not stop picturing with her, i can not, (ross stands up and backs away) it does not matter what you say, or what you do, ross. it is just changed, everything. forever.
(crying) yeah, but this can not be it, i mean.
then how come it is?
they have been quiet for a long time.
maybe she killed him?
let us go.
(to joey) is that your new walk?
(whispering) no, i really have to pee.
(thinking) all right. it is a new day. all that stuff about rachel, you do not feel that now. it was crazy! you are fine. you are better than fine! you are, as your friend tony would say, grrrreat! everything’s normal! she is just your friend rachel! your friend rachel. your friend! rachel.
(coming from her room) hi, sweetie.
(thinking) hey, it is your girlfriend, rachel!
(airily) hi.
are you, are you high?
i just had the most amazing bath.
really? i do not like baths.
wait, you like them with me.
honey, it is not the bath i enjoy, it is the wet, naked lady.
oh, baths are so relaxing!
really? what do you do? you just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
how dirty do you think i am? I am telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! it would take all of your stress away.
honey, it is 2:00 on a wednesday and I am watching road rules, how stressed do you think i am?
(entering) hey, chandler, you got a minute? i-i really need to talk to you.
oh! uh, yeah! is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
well, neither.
oh my god, what is up?!
i do not know. it is-it is just…lately, I have been feeling… okay, here is what it is… (pause) you know what? i feel a lot better, thanks! (starts to leave)
oh no-no, no you do not, just come back.
all right. okay. you and monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to london. oh, no, but that is different. i mean, there are rules there, too! you know what i mean?
do you?
it was different for you guys! i mean, i mean, you were both in the same place, right?
in london?
yeah.
yes. when monica and i were in london, we were both in london.
you know what? this is a bad idea. forget it. forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
if that.
hi! oh, ross, do not forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!
right.
hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
no-no, we talked about it. we do not want to know. all we care about is that it is happy and healthy.
yep! happy and healthy! and cute!
and smart!
popular.
with an aptitude for science.
are you two talking about the same baby? hey! have you started off thinking of names yet?
oh yeah! I have come up with a bunch of ideas!
really? me too!
me too!
really?!
uh huh! if it is a girl, phoebe, and if it is a boy, phoebo!
maybe. but it would not hurt to have a backup, you know? uh, rach-rach, what were you thinking? (gives her a look)
okay! i was thinking if it is a girl, how about sandrine? it is french.
huh. that is a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
okay fine, what do you have?
well, ok, it is for a boy. well, i know it is a little out there, but…darwin.
wow, oh my god, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
yeah, by sandrine.
you are just saying that because i said no to your name!
I am really, really not.
how-how about you each get five vetoes?
all right.
all right.
that sounds fair.
yeah! i do not think you are going to need it though. okay, check this out. if it is a girl, rain.
veto.
why?
rain? hi. hi, my name is rain. i have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
i know her! i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show!
okay, how about, for a guy, thatcher?
ross, why do you hate our child?
fine, you go.
okay, james.
huh.
but only if it is a girl.
oh, veto. how about—ooh, i like ruth! what about ruth?
oh! I am sorry! are we having an 89-year-old? how about dayton?
veto. stewart?
veto. sawyer?
veto. helen?
veto.
is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
hey.
boy, do i have a surprise for you!
sex on the balcony?
no, but someone is really not going to get over that idea, are they?
what is it?
i drew you a bath!
honey, i do not like baths! could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
please, could you just try it for me? come on, i used all my best stuff! i-i-i lit some candles. i put on some music. i used bath salts, plus bubble bath! and got you this little plastic navy ship. so it is a boy bath!
well, this does butch it up a bit.
i swear, if you try it, you will love it!
all right, if i do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
absolutely.
bet i know how that discussion’s going to go.
(thinking) all right, this is not so bad. i like the flower smell! which is okay, because I have got my boat.
(entering) so?
oh my god.
i told you you were a bath person! hey, when you get out, maybe i can give you a facial!
I am going to need a bigger boat.
i do not think you had an open mind about the name ruth. i mean, come on, little ruthie geller, how-how cute is that?
oh, oh my god! i can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
uh, no. no, we are not.
but you have it right there in that file? you could tell us whether it is a boy or a girl? dayton or sandrine? phoebe or phoebo?
no, no, we want to wait, right?
right. right.
(looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) so, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
what? rach! come on, that is terrible! they are…uh…they are babies. they are-they are all beautiful.
third one from the left?
yeah, why is it staring at me? i think it knows I am talking about it. (rachel starts to peek at the file) do not-do not you—wh—wha—hey!!
what?!
you are looking!
i did not!
i saw you!
okay fine, i did. but i did not see anything, i swear.
shame on you! ugly baby judges you!
okay, but ross just listen to me…
no, no, no, no! do not tell me! i do not want to know!
but i could not even if i wanted to, because i do not know! i swear; i did not see anything, and i do not want to know! it was just a momentary lapse.
momentary lapse. do not-do not you have any self-control?
(holding stomach) okay, a couple months late on the lecture, ross.
hello?
I am in the bathroom, can you come in here? i think there is something wrong.
you know what? i-i think I will wait out here.
I am in the bathtub.
oh. (she goes into the bathroom.) what is wrong?
i drew my own bath, but i did it wrong! the water’s tepid. the salt did not dissolve and is now… lodged places. and the scents i used do not compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomile—oh!
what?
the bath salts! they are starting to effervesce! it is different. (pause) it is interesting.
okay, let us talk about something else.
yeah! sure, sure. so, what was going on with you today? oh-oh-oh!
well, i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey. he was talking about rules and right and wrong and…
i had the exact same conversation.
you did? what was he talking about?
i do not know! joey has not had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth!
(groans) that was a long night.
all right, let us break this down. what exactly did he say to you?
okay, he was talking about rules.
uh-huh.
umm, and looking at people differently.
he did not say anything about that to me.
what did he tell you?
he was asking all these questions about you, me, and london. and, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
okay. so you, me and london. looking at people differently. maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone.
but what did he mean by rules?
wait a minute! he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in!
because he was looking at her differently.
and phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
my god! he wants to do it with phoebe in london!
(from outside the bathroom) you guys?
just a minute! (to chandler) that is mrs. tribbiani!
you do not say anything.
why would i say anything? that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! and they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
I am not going to let you say anything.
you just stay here! (dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)
oh, god!
oh, hey, monica, i brought back your iron.
oh, you had that?
uh-huh.
i thought i lost it. i got a new one, like, a month ago.
oh, just as well, i broke this one.
what?
nothing.
okay.
i mean, i-i, i really should not say. i mean, I am really not supposed to.
fine.
it is a humdinger!
then it is really too bad that you can not tell me.
somebody likes you!
(groans) is it chandler?
no!
well, then tell him to stop staring!
it is joey!
really?! joey?! you do not say.
is it something you would be interested in?
i do not know, i do not know, i do not know. you know, i mean, on the one hand, mother may i? but y’know on the other hand… no. no, i can not. we are friends. no, oh, no. i do not want to risk what we have.
i guess that makes sense. so, you think you are going to talk to him?
sure, yeah. i mean, it is joey. i do not want him to get hurt. well, i must say, i am on fire! first chandler, now joey!
not chandler, just joey.
sure.
hey.
hey.
you know what? I have been thinking about it. I am really coming around on the name ruth. i think i would actually consider naming our child that.
rach, i-i can not tell you how-how much that means to me! ohh… wait a minute. wait a minute. you-you hated the name ruth! why-why would you change your mind? unless, you know we are never going to have to use it. you did see the folder. you know it is a boy!
i did not see anything! i actually changed my mind about the name.
i do not think so! you are just giving me ruth so you will get to name it when it is a boy, and that is when you will swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia.
i would—sequoia?
veto.
fine.
unless… (rachel groans.) you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named ruth! well, I am not falling for that! okay? ruth is off the table!
but ross, you want the name ruth!
not like this!
hey.
hey. well, what is up?
umm, joey, i know.
what?
i knooow.
whaaat?
i know about your feelings.
oh my god. you do?
yes, and I am sorry. i-i know things worked out for chandler and monica, but that is very rare.
i know. i know. and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. i mean, it is rachel for god sakes.
for god sakes, it is rachel!
i know. i know. and she is not only my friend; she is my pregnant friend! she is my pregnant friend who is ross’ ex!
yeah that is rachel. (to herself) beat me over the head with it.
what am i going to do? you know, and i keep, i keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i do not like about her. you want to hear it?
yeah.
she made me switch to light mayo. that is it! that is all i got! and, you know what? it tastes the same and my pants fit better!
joey, i just think you are getting worked up over nothing. this is probably just a crush.
you think?
absolutely! y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.
yeah, just a crush! that is all this is! it is a crush! I am joey; i do not get deep feelings.
that is right, there you go! crushes happen all the time! i know I have had them for all you guys. well, except for ross and chandler. and I am sure you have had them for us.
not really.
mm-hmm. (to herself) throw me a bone here.
so, i uh… i called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
what?
that is right. the student has become the master.
ross, i swear, i do not know.
oh, come on, you know it is a girl!
a what?!
you really did not know?
we are having a girl?
no.
that is what you just said!
no.
you said girl!
yes. I am… I am sorry. I am so sorry.
I am not! we are having a girl! sometimes i can not believe it is with you—but still! we are having a girl!
i know! i know. you know what? I am putting ruth back on the table!
oh, yes! we will have ourselves a little baby ruth…
permission to veto.
yes, please.
hey.
do i smell essential oils?
yeah, I am going to take a bath. I am just going to get a magazine.
okay.
what do you think you are doing?
l-leaving my troubles behind?
i know that you are new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
oh, it is so hard to care when you are this relaxed.
fine, you can have the bath, but i am taking your boat. now you are just a girl in a tub!
(upset) hey!
hi, bubbles. manly. well, i just thought i would drop by and let you know how it went with joey.
(to monica) you told her?!
she pulled it out of me! she is like a conversational wizard! how did it go?
well, you were wrong, he does not like me!
what?
yeah! how would you like it if i sent you to lee majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he did not like you? how would you feel?
(pause) i do not think I would care.
really? lee majors is hot!
(from outside the bathroom) hello?
we are in the bathroom!
why?
(sarcastically) because it is a relaxing and enjoyable time!
(entering the bathroom) what are you guys doing in here?
oh my god! a friend he is looking at differently, but it is wrong. it is rachel!
you like rachel?!
it is no big deal, okay? phoebe and i talked about it. it is just a crush! it is going to go away! (looks down) dude, you got to rearrange your bubbles! oh!
(checking for herself) (to monica) mazel tov.
(entering) hey! ross and i were looking for you! what are we all doing in here? (looks at chandler) oh, my! (covers the spot where joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)
honey, cover it up with the boat!
(from outside the bathroom) hello?
(sarcastically) yes we are all in here and we would love for you to join us!
(entering) well hey! what is going on? ooh, cool boat—(sees why the boat’s there)—oh, no. (averts his eyes by looking around the room) (to rachel) hey, did you, did you tell them?
no, i was waiting for you!
tell us what?
we are having a girl.
I will…I will get you later!
(thinking) all right. it is a new day, and it is just a crush, that is all! just a little crush! all that worrying i was doing, that was crazy. crazy! like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" everything’s going to be fine. it is just a crush.
(entering) hi, sweetie.
(thinking) i love you.
it sure is nice to do this together, is not it?
yeah. and what you are doing feels so good.
I am not touching you.
you are not?
it is the salts.
oh, sweet lord. new realms of pleasure!
(to herself) whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
hey
hey. so where is mon?
oh, she is at home, putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight.
and you are not helping?
i tried, but apparantly singing "i will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.
hey you guys!
shhh do not say that loud, gunther's going to want to hug me.
uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. this is molly (points to molly). molly, chandler, joey.
ooh, somebody is getting a little fussy.
you damn right i am, I have been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
ok, you know what, I am just going to take her outside.
ok, thank you.
yeah, you too.
oh, wow, molly is just great!
yeah.
yes, bravo on the hot nanny.
what? you really think she is hot?
are you kidding? if i was not married she would be rejecting me right now.
and joey?
how do you think she is doing?
am i the only one who does not think that she is hot? ross?
eh, i mean, i mena she is not unattractive but hot? i ....
thank you! (goes to get coffee)
now that rachel's gone?
so hot i cried myself to sleep last night. (joey and chandler clap their hands)
hey mike, what is the capital of peru?
no. it starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". helpfully with a "to" in the middle.
what?
(relived) oh, whew, no, that is bob.
well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who i put food out for, you know. kind of like santa. except santa does not poop on the plate of cookies.
what are those?
ok, fine, if it means that much to you I will get rid of bob.
so weird, you think he is so gross and you are willing to eat his crackers. (mike throws out everything in his mouth)
hello.
gavin, i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation. i really owe you an appology.
well, when we first met, you know, i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
no, i just mean that, you know, first impressions do not mean anything. and i-i think you are a really good guy and I am sorry that i misjudged you.
hello. (to gavin) but you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, i am just really really happy ... (sees gavin staring at heather) I am sorry, obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so I will just wait 'till it is finished.
i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
oh wow, you are really, you are really a creep.
oh yeah, I am jealous. "oh gavin, please, please look at my ass". (gavin starts looking) stop looking at my ass! i mean, i just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? this is a work environment, she is your subordinate.
that is totally different for two reasons. one - i did not know that you knew that. and two, i was not some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.
it was ... (can not remember) oh my god. he did not have a last name. it was just "tag". you know, like cher, or, you know, moses.
oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. you are arrogant, you are pompous ... morgan! morgan! tag's last name was morgan! huh!
yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?
man, i wish i had a nanny like you.
sure.
would you stop staring at her?
i was not staring. i was leering.
what is the big deal with her? maybe she is attractive in an obvious kind of way.
yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. you know, when it is right there in your face. me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive. makes me feel like i earned it.
looks like joey is doing allright with her.
yeah. hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once.
ok, I will be home right after work. ok, by emma-wemma-demma, i love you - wovyou dovyou ...
they have elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it is not so good.
(to joey) hey, listen, joey, about molly, i really prefer if you did not go after her.
why not?
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i would not want anything to, you know, drive her away.
so, what, you think I am just going to sleep with her and never call her again and things are going to get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) yeah, sounds about right.
come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? just - just forget about her, ok? just, she is off limits.
oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? now that you told me i can not have it makes me want her even more!
what are you, a child?
yes!
joey, come on now, for me! please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
fine. (looks around, then focuses on monica)
(to chandler) take me home! (they quickly leave)
hey mikey
what are you doing?
to kill bob??
no, mike, i do not want to kill him! i thought we were just going to capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
I will find bob, I will get him. bob? (starts looking) bob! robert! (looks at cabinet under sink) oh wait, i think i hear him. oh - oh my god! bob had babies! bob's a mom!
i do not know, i kind of like bob for a girl.
oh my god, we killed bob!
suzie? (runs over there to check)
whazzup??
seriously dude, 3 years ago.
listen, can you do me a favor? I am going to be out today. can you just keep an eye on joey, make sure nothing happens between him and molly?
you do not trust him?
wh - no. some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".
is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? because i could get a job any day now.
you do appear right on the cusp of something. come on man, I am sure he will lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?
allright, fine, but do not blame me if it does not work. because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he is going to have sex with it.
well we got to do something, ok? nannies like her do not grow on trees. (pause)
picturing that tree?
i am, yes.
where you going, joe?
for a walk.
oh. you mind if i join you?
actually, that will be long. you know, i really need to organize my thoughts.
your thoughts? plural?
allright, fine, i only have one thought! it is about the hot nanny, i got to see her!
I am afraid i can not let you do that, joe.
now you are telling me i can not see her?? you guys are killing me! she is forbidden fruit! it is like ... like she is the princess and I am the stable boy ... why are you doing this, huh? did ross tell you not to let me go over there?
yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can not let you go.
huh. interesting. now there are obstacles. hot nanny and me against the world. this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
great novels?
fine ... mediocre porn
rachel green's office!! give me that phone! (takes the phone) hello, this is rachel green, how can i help you? uh huh ... ok then ... I will pass you back to your son (gives phone to gavin)
um, excuse me gavin, i have a question i need to ask you.
if you like looking at butts so much why do not you just go look at a mirror?
oh, please, i do not care about you enough to bug me. in fact, from now on, I am going take the high road. and I am going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
hey rach!
hi!
ready for your birthday lunch?
yeah i am, i am! oh, but first of all, monica, i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle.
pleased to meet you. so you are coming to rachel's party tonight?
oh no no no no no, gavin can not, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
why did you invite him?? i can not stand that guy!
you were just being so nice to him!
i was faking it! can not you tell when I am being fake?
hey, mr philips, nice suit!
right there! that was so fake!
shh!
(to monica) i still can not believe you invited gavin. allright, he is the last person i want to see.
oh, you are welcome for the party. I am glad you are having a good time.
god, i hope he does not show up. of course he is not going to show up, the guy hates me.
does he?
what?
maybe he is bothering you so much because he likes you. it is like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
oh, monica, you think skippy liked you? honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
oh, ok, thank you. (molly leaves) (to monica) do you see what all the guys see in her?
would not kick her out of bed. no more vodka for me! (put her glass down)
hey rach, so can i sing happy birthday to you now?
yeah, sure!
oh ... (starts to sing) happy birth ... (sees molly leaving) oh, see you later (runs after molly)
hey rach, somebody got you shoes!
oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws away the box, she and mon jump up the sofa)
be careful, be careful! these are my rat babies!
ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?
so this is what a stroke feels like.
i had to bring them! we killed their mother, they are our responsibility now. you know, they require constant care. you should know that, rachel, you are a mother.
are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
no! seven rats! i think we should take them home, we need feed them.
whhh wait, you are going to leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
well I am sorry rachel, but I am not like you, ok? not everyone can afford help. (she and mike leave)
where the hell are joey and molly? i asked you to watch them.
(in a helium voice, holding a balloon) I am sorry, i got a little occupied.
we have to stop them before something happens!
(still helium voice) right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)
so you see, molly, what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline. it takes a lot of hard work.
oh, i did not go to college.
molly ... people do not study acting ...
molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
thanx.
(upset) will the stable boy never get the princess??
what do you think you are going to do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
no ... the leather sticks to my ass. you know, this is not fair. what makes you think that I am just going to sleep with her and then blow her off? huh? can not you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) look, the truth is, i have not felt this way about anyone since rachel, ok? i did not think i could ever love again.
ok (admits)
yeah, come on in. molly?
ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) well, uh, joey, i guess we have no problem.
it is like my favorite fairy tale come true! (chandler looks at him) the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we got to put them straight to bed.
well, you know what, they are our responsibility now.
mate? they are all brothers and sisters.
no. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! oh my god, what are we going to do? we have 7 rats. so what if each of them has 7 rats? and then each of those have 7 rats? that is like ... (starts counting with her fingers) that is math i can not even do! what are we going to do?
yeah, ok. i guess you are right. allright, so we should just give them away. but to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. they are bob's favorites.
you must think I am crazy.
good. it is just so hard, it is hard for me to ... let them go. i guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when i gave birth to my brother's triplets and i had to give them up. (mike is shocked) i have not told you about that yet, have i?
hey!
hi. thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up?
no way! you had your party, now i have mine! is everything alright?
yeah, i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. that jerk gavin from your office did not show up (gavin shows up at the balcony windows).
mmm hmm.
oh, we were not talking about you. no, no way to recover.
no.
well, it was, and you would have seen it if you did not showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? god! oh, this party was lame ...
(from inside) again, you are welcome.
oh, you bought me a present! why?
aww. well, ok, well that is very nice. and you wrote a card (opens the card). "from gavin"
(opens the present, it is a green scarf) awww, awww, it is beautiful.
see, gavin, you are capable of being a nice guy. why did you give me such a hard time?
well monica seems to think it is because you have feelings for me.
you do?
see? why, gavin, why? right when I am about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ... (they kiss again)
(sings in a helium voice) first i was afraid, i was petrified (very happy)
(walks in) hey
(normal voice) hi
listen, i think I have left something here.
oh, well someone left this (shows a green jacket). this is yours?
(likes the jacket) no, but i like it. i think i left one of my rat babies.
oh, uh, well, i have not seem it but if i do I will let you know.
ohmygod! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby! (screams from another room)
(realizes) ooh, maybe that is him!you know, I am thinking about letting emma have her first cookie.
her first cookie? she has cookies all the time!
I have never given her a cookie. have you?
no! no... and, for the record, I have also never given her a frosting from a can!
hey rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
of course, I would be honored!
thanks!
thank you!
you-you-um, i think there is been an oversight.
joey, we would have asked you, we just thought you would not be interested.
yeah, it is just we do not think of you as really being so much "with the words".
whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
clearly we were wrong.
i got to a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? and i know how much you want to have a baby, you know, and i would love to help you get one.
you know what? then, joey, we want you to do it.
thank you! alright, let me see how I am going to start... "dear baby adoption decider people..."
so excited about your letter!
hey!
hey!
wow! do not you look nice?!
yes, i do! today is mike and my one-year anniversary.
oh! what is it the anniversary of? your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...
yeah!
so you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
uh-uh. ehm, a knicks game.
uhm... are not you a little overdressed?
hey, you know what, I have never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I am wearing something fancy pants, and... I am going to put on my finest jewelry and we are going to have sex in a public rest room.
you guys do that? chandler will not even have sex in our bathroom!
that is where people make number two!!
hey...
(surprised) oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) ohh... I would love to but i really have to grade these papers.
(writing on the papers) b, b, b, b, b!
well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
damnit!
(he opens the door) hi amy!
still sharp as a tack!
(pause) ross? i... i grew up on your block! we had thanksgiving together last year... i had a baby with your sister!
(gives up) yes, yes, you did.
hi rachel! here is your sister amy! she thinks i need pec implants!
amy! hi! oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) wow! you remember joey?
that is right, yeah.
always nice to meet a fan!
so now, what are you doing here?
(emma starts crying in the other room) oh sorry, hold on. let me just check on the baby!
ehm... her name is emma.
what do i know? i just sell middle eastern food from a cart!
(to joey) oh my god!
i know, she may be the hottest girl I have ever hated.
what... what you working on?
(using a laptop) oh, monica and chandler's recommendation. i want it to sound smart but.. i do not know any big words or anything, so...
why do not you use your thesaurus?
what did i just say?
watch. (he takes the laptop) here, you ehm... you highlight the word you want to change.
oh my god, that is great! I am smart!! no, no, I am... (he uses the thesaurus) "brainy, bright, clever", i love this thing! look out ladies, joey tribbiani's got the whole package!!
god!
oh, i know, is not she?
all right. what is your news, amy?
what? oh my god! to who?
a-and??
no, what is he like?
yeah.
huh... wow, so he is got to be...
sweety, i got to tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
oh... sit down, sit down. oh, honey, you know, i once also almost married somebody that i did not love. do you remember barry?
sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying barry was the best decision that i ever, ever made. honey, you deserve true love. your soulmate is out there, somewhere. someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!
ok.
ok, let us keep talking.
excuse me, anniversary. excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... they are in my seat. it is my anniversary. (to mike) here we are! (mike nods). can not believe it is been a whole year!
me too! i never thought i could love someone this much!
you are so generous and kind and (crowd stops cheering) you are amazing in bed (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) it is our anniversary!
oh how lame... oh, it is so tacky, and impersonal.
oh, it is the worst way to propose!
hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to chandler) here. and i think you will be very, very happy. it is the longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
(reading) i do not... uh... understand.
(sounding very proud of himself) some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
(also reading it) it does not make any sense.
of course it does! it is smart! i used the the-saurus!
on every word?
yep!
alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to joey)
oh, ‘they are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.
and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
yeah, yeah and hey, i really mean it, dude.
hey joey, i do not think we can use this.
why not?
well, because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani (joey makes a 'and-what is-wrong-with-that' look). hey, why do not you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
you know what? you do not need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
amy, hi!
oh, good for you!
yes you are! oh, i am so proud of you!
but erin brockovich had her own house.
ah, look who is back! (he sees the bags) why do you have bags? rach, why does she have bags?
what?
you slept out here?
yeah... amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘myron, get off!’
but uhm, we are getting rid of her, right? rach, please tell me we are getting rid of her.
joey, i can not do that!
oh, come on! last night i was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping amy badly) "uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" i do not need that kind of talk in my house!
well joey, uhm look, i know that she is difficult, but i think it is really good that she is here.
because we will appreciate it more when she is gone?
no, it is just... look, you know, when i first moved to the city i was a lot like her! i was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
yeah, monica made us!
well, uhm... whatever, i have really appreciated it, because i do not think i would be the person that i am today if it was not for you guys. see, i want to help amy the way you guys helped me. and i know it is going to take patience, but that is ok.
yeaah.
amy, that is what i was supposed to wear today, that is why i hung it on the door.
amy, you know what? i was thinking that maybe now it would be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
(yelling at her) I am curvy, and i like it!
hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever.
i doubt that! tell her about us last year.
oh, well, i bought chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
seriously?
word!
well, mine was worse than that.
well, what happened?
we were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
oh, that is so tacky.
well, that is what i said, but it turns out, mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
oh my god, mike was going to propose?
phoebe, that is huge!
well, do you want to marry him?
yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was going to propose to me, i do not think he is ever going to ask again! i mean, i said no in barbados and now this!
she is right! if i were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) did i just say if i were a guy..?
maybe you do not need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
oh, i do not know, i do not know, is not that a little desperate?
i proposed to chandler! (phoebe stops herself from laughing) alright, moving on...
oh, i do not think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!
thank you.
(to rachel and ross) well, do you think i should propose?
i think it could be kind of great!
absolutely! you will love the feeling! there is nothing like it!
ok, ok, so how should i do it?
how about at a game, on the big screen?
(sarcastically) uuuh!! how about at a footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)
what? what? he obviously thinks that is a nice way to be proposed to, plus he would never suspect it!
yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two (points to ross and chandler) like that?
sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
(takes the phone) oh! that is interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
(into the phone) hello? (announces to amy) oh, it is our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) hi! oh... god! i hope you feel better! ok, bye! (hangs up) (to ross) that is molly, she is sick. can you watch emma today?
no, i can not. i have back-to-back classes. did molly say what she had? because my throat's been hurting?
menstrual cramps.
i do not think that is what this is.
(to monica, chandler and phoebe) can any of you watch emma?
no, sorry sweety..
no, I have got work and then I am proposing..
(to ross) great, shoot, what are we going to do?
(thinks for a moment) well, actually...
(he interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) well, can i talk to you for a sec.?
yeah.
um, i do not want her baby-sitting our child.
why not?
well, for one thing, she keeps calling her ella!
(defends amy) wha.. well, ella's a nice name!
fine, we will call the next one ella.
(shocked) wha... the next one?
(a little confused) okay, um... i do not want her watching our baby.
ross, i am trying to help her become a better person. this is a huge breakthrough for her! she just offered to do something for another human being!!
i... i do not know..
ross, I am telling you, she is giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? do you understand how important that is in our world?
absolutely.
hey joe! how is the second draft of the letter coming?
great, I am finished! in fact, i just dropped it off at the agency.
you dropped it off?
yeah.
can we read it? can you print out another copy?
no can do amigo. no, i did not use the computer. felt more personal to hand-write it. (chandler and monica look even more shocked)
you hand-wrote it?
yeah, and do not worry. i did not try to sound smart at all! see ya later! (leaves)
oh my god, oh my god, that letter is going to go in our file! we are never going to get a kid. no, we are going to be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
it is ok, it is ok. you know what? (takes out his mobile) I will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
okay good.
(on the phone) hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) uh-huh... uh-huh... okay... thank you. good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).
ugh, we are screwed, are not we? you know what? just tell me on the way to the bird store.
(still looks confused) they loved it.
what?
they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
(surprised) they thought joey was a child?
she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
hey, what did you guys do today?
that sounds like fun.
(to emma) hey! hi, how is my girl?
(sounds excited) yeah!
(not excited anymore) you pierced her ears!?
you pierced her ears? how could you do this without telling me?
i think she looks cute. (rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but i am wrong!
oh my god, oh my god, here comes ross. he is going to flip out.
ugh. (takes the hat and covers emma's head and half her face with it)
hey guys.
hey emma. oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? she can barely see. (wants to take the hat off, but rachel tries to stop him).
nah, i do not really want her to see.
why not?
because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
come here (removes emma's hat) oh! there she is! hi!
(sees how strangely monica, chandler and rachel are looking at him) what?
nothing.
(back to emma) hi! (looks at her) what... (moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. he looks at her confused. finally he realizes the difference and gasps). please tell me those are clip-ons.
oh, they are real!
did she (points at amy) do this to her? i told you we should not have left emma with her!
i know, i know, and you were right ross. (to amy) you are soo irresponsible i am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
I am a cool, fun aunt!
hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
i can not believe this. all i wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
oh yeah? since when?
(looks at ross and then at amy again in disbelief) what?
that is not a thing!
(shouting) babies do not care if they are slim.
(very angry) amy, i ju... i just... i just want to...
(pointing at amy, shouting) no more falafel for you!
uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)
I am not. I am praying. (looking up) please let the knicks win... thank you thor! (mike is standing up) where... where are you going?
well, i think you should wait.
well, if you do not... if you do not hold it in, you do not get all the nutrients.
mike hannigan... will you marry me? (mike looks bewildered)
that is not very enlightened!
hey, hey! (shouting) boo us? boo you!
(picks up the phone) hello? yeah, this is joey tribbiani... oh, hi! well, I am glad you liked my letter... no my mommy and daddy are not home right now... (looks puzzled) okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) she was nice!
joey, get amy's bags, she is moving out!
whoo-hoo! (and leaves for rachel's room)
you put holes in my baby's ears!
(gasps) i can not believe i ever even tried to help you. you are so beyond help.
excuse me?
(yelling) joey, where are those bags?
(yelling from rachel's room) she has a lot of crap!
(does not believe what she is hearing) seriously?
hips or thighs?
(gasps) oh! oh my god! i thought she was on atkins.
(embarrassed) oh, i can give you that.
yeah. i just, i kept trying to make you a better person, but you are... you are already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
did you just say emma?
that woman at the game did not know what she was talking about. mike, obviously you have balls.
(the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) i would love it. consider it forgotten... but just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, i promise I will say yes. whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
it is in the cake, is not it?
what is the matter with me? how do i keep ruining this? I am sorry, I am sorry!
oh my god!
wait! oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. after that mike starts to kneel again, but then...) oh no! (she was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)
uh-huh! (and now mike kneels properly)
yes!
i love you more!
so how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
that is shocking!
(looking out the window) oh hey, you guys, look! ugly naked guy is putting stuff in boxes!
I would say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
ohh, I am going to miss that big old squishy butt.
and we are done with the chicken fried rice.
hey! hey! if he is moving, maybe i should try to get his place!
it would be so cool to live across from you guys!
hey, yeah! then we could do that telephone thing! y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it is connected by a string!
or we can do the actual telephone thing.
oh my god! i love this apartment! is not it perfect?! i can not believe i never realized how great it is!
well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
it is amazing! you better hurry up and fill out an application or I am going to beat you to it.
(laughing) ohh. (phoebe takes a couple of steps to the door and ross quickly hurries out.)
well, i never thought I would say this, but I am going to go use ugly naked guy's bathroom. (does so.)
(looking out the window) oh, look! there is monica and chandler! (starts yelling.) hey! hey, you guys! hey! (chandler and monica start taking each other's clothes off.) ohh!! ohh! ahh-ahhh!!
what?!
(screaming) ahhh!! chandler and monica!! chandler and monica!!
oh my god!
chandler and monica!!!!
oh my god!!!
oh!! my eyes!!! my eyes!!!!
phoebe!! phoebe!! it is okay!! it is okay!!
no! they are doing it!!!
i know!! i know!! i know!
you know?!!!
yes, i know! and joey knows! but ross does not know so you have to stop screaming!!
(entering) what is going on?
(trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) hi!! hi!
what?! what?!
nothing! oh god, we are just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
actually, it looks really good. (turns towards the window and now phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)
(screaming incoherently.) get in here!!! (motions to join her and rachel.)
you mean whenever monica and chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—oh! all that time monica spent on the phone with sad linda from camp!
uh-huh, doing it. doing it. phone doing it.
oh! oh, i can not believe it! i mean i think it is great! for him. she might be able to do better.
(entering) hey guys!
joey! come here! come here!
what? what?
phoebe just found out about monica and chandler.
you mean how they are friends and nothing more? (glares at rachel.)
no. joey, she knows! we were at ugly naked guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window. (joey gasps) actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
okay, so now they know that you know and they do not know that rachel knows?
yes, but y'know what? it does not matter who knows what. now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
wh-what do you mean?
well y'know every time that they say that like they are doing laundry we will just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
ohhh, i-i would enjoy that!
no-no-no! no-no wait rach, you know what would even be more fun? telling them.
ehhh, no, i want to do phoebe's thing.
i can not take any…
no! you do not have to do anything! just do not tell them that we know!
noo! i can not take any more secrets! (to rachel) I have got your secrets. I have got their secrets. i got secrets of my own y'know!
you do not have any secrets!
oh yeah? well, you do not know about hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal. (joey shies away.)
(to phoebe) so umm, how-how are we going to mess with them?
ugh.
well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
okay.
and then. i would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. my sexuality.
(entering) hello children!
okay, watch, learn, and do not eat my cookie.
hey.
hey! ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!
really?
(feels his arm) yeah the material feels so soft—hello mr. bicep! have you been working out?
well, i try to y'know, squeeze things. (phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) are you okay?
well, if you really want to know, I am—oh! i can not tell you this.
phoebe, it is me. you can tell me anything.
well actually you are the one person i can not tell this too. and the one person i want to the most.
what is going on?
i think it is just y'know that i have not been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you are looking for something and you just do not even see that it is right there in front of you sipping coffee—oh no, have i said to much? well it is just something to think about. i know i will.
you are so cute! how did you get to be so cute?
well, my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
okay, now you are even cuter!!
y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say.
what?
the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, i think, i think phoebe was hitting on me.
what are you talking about?
I am telling you i think phoebe thinks I am foxy.
that is not possible!
ow!
I am sorry it is just, phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
oh, y'know i-i can not hear that enough.
I am sorry, i think that you just misunderstood her.
no, i did not misunderstand, okay? she was all over me! she touched my bicep for crying out loud!
this bicep?
well it is not flexed right now!
hey mon, what are you doing now? want to come see a movie with us?
uhh, y'know actually i was going to do some laundry.
oh.
hey chandler, want to do it with me?
sure, I will do it with ya.
okay.
okay great, hold on a sec! (she runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) oh, here you go! you do not mind do ya? that would really help me out a lot! thanks!
i mean i-i do not i think i have enough quarters.
i have quarters! (she holds up a bag of quarters.)
(entering) hey!
hey ross! any word on the apartment yet?
well, i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he is already had like a hundred applicants.
oh.
no-no, i got the edge. i know it is not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to
oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
no.
that new mountain bike?
no.
well what did you send?
a basket of mini-muffins.
but there is a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. which one did you send?
the small one.
what?! you-you actually thought that basket was going to get you the apartment?
well yeah! someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. it was the best day.
your work makes me sad.
oh man! i want that place so much!! i was so sure that was going to work! there is twelve bucks I will never see again! (exits.)
all right honey, we would better go if we want to catch that movie.
bye!
bye chandler! (she walks up to him.) (quietly.) i miss you already. (she pinches his butt.)
(after they have left) okay, did you see that?! with the inappropriate and the pinching!!
actually, i did!
okay, so now do you believe that she is attracted to me?
ohhh, oh my god! oh my god! she knows about us!
are you serious?
phoebe knows and she is just trying to freak us out! that is the only explanation for it!
(a little hurt) okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—she knows!
(entering) joey!
yeah?
phoebe knows about us!
well i did not tell them!
them?! who is them?
uhhh, phoebe and joey.
joey!
and rachel. i would have told you but they made me promise not to tell!
oh man!
I am sorry! but hey, it is over now, right? because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
unless…
no! not unless! look this must end now!
oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! but see they do not know that we know that they know! so…
ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
noooo.
oh ross, honey you got to stop torturing yourself!
yeah, why do not you just find another apartment?
look I have already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
y'know what you should do?
huh?
you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. yeah! like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. or uh, or my underwear.
I am listening.
(to ross) see?
that is a great idea! and! i know ugly naked guy because we have been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! oh, let us see now he had the trampoline.
he broke that.
well, he had gravity boots.
yeah, he broke those too.
so he likes to break stuff.
okay, I have got to go pick up ben but i-i will figure something out. (he opens the door and stops.) hey, did not he used to have a cat?
i would not bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
right. (exits.)
hello! (listens) oh yeah! hey! hold on a second she is right here! (to phoebe) it is chandler.
(in a sexy voice) oh? (takes the phone from rachel.) hello you.
hello phoebe, I have been thinking about you all day. (he is holding the phone so that monica can hear it as well.)
eh?
well you know that thing you said before, I would be lying if i said i was not intrigued.
really?
yeah, listen, joey is not going to be here tonight so why do not you come over and I will let you uh, feel my bicep. or maybe more.
I will have to get back to you on that. okay, bye! (hangs up.) oh my god! he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
are you kidding?!
no!
i can not believe he would do that to mon—whoa! (she stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at joey. joey is avoiding her eyes.) joey, do they know that we know?
no.
joey!
they know you know.
ugh, i knew it! oh i cannot believe those two!
god, they thought they can mess with us! they are trying to mess with us?! they do not know that we know they know we know! (joey just shakes his head.) joey, you can not say anything!
i could not even if i wanted too.
good evening, sir. my name is ross geller. I am one of the people who applied for the apartment. and i-i realize that the competition is fierce but—I am sorry. i, i can not help but notice you are naked and (he claps his hands.) i applaud you. man, i wish i was naked. i mean, this-this looks so great. that is how god intended it.
(in the kitchen with chandler) look at them, they are-they are panicked!
oh yeah, they are totally going to back down!
oh yeah!
all right. all right! if he wants a date? he is going to get a date. all right, I am going to go in.

(laughs) please.
so chandler, i-I would love to come by tonight.
(initially worried, but gets over it) really?
oh absolutely. shall we say, around seven?
yes.
good. I am really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
(looking out the window) hey-hey, check it out! check it out! ugly naked guy has a naked friend!
oh yeah! (she gasps.) oh my god! that is our friend! (monica covers her face.) it is naked ross! (monica turns and buries her face in chandler's shoulder.)
show time!
okay, rachel, get me perfume!
okay! (she runs to get some.)
and joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses? (he begrudgingly does so.)
all right, it will be great! you just make her think you want to have sex with her! it will totally freak her out!
okay, listen, how far am i going to have to go with her?
relax, she-she is going to give in way before you do!
how do you know?!
because you are on my team! and my team always wins!
at this?!
just go get some! (kisses him.) go! (she runs to hide in the bathroom.)
(handing her the wine) okay honey, now I am going to try to listen from right here!
okay.
okay? whoa, wait! (she undoes one button on phoebe's dress.)
good idea!
yeah, oh wait! (she goes for another one.)
oh now, do not give away the farm!
phoebe.

so, here we are. nervous?
me? no. you?
no, i want this to happen.
so do i.
I am going to put on some music.
maybe, maybe I will dance for you. (she starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that is silly at the same time.)
you look good.
thanks! y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me want to rip that sweater vest right off!
well, why do not we move this into the bedroom?
really?
oh, do you not want to?
no. no! it is just y'know first, i want to take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
(swallowing hard) well that would be nice. I will go get the lotion.
listen, this is totally getting out of hand! okay? she wants me to put lotion on her!
she is bluffing!
look, she is not backing down! she went like this! (he does a little mimic of her dance.)
he is not backing down. he went to get lotion.
(entering the hall) oh man! are not you guys done yet?! i want to sit in my chair!
joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner phoebe breaks chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
ooh!
okay!
i like that! (to phoebe) oh, okay! show him your bra! he is afraid of bras! can not work  them! (he swiftly rips open the front of phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
joey! (examining the dress.) wow, you did not rip off any buttons.
it is not my first time.
you go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
okay, give me a second! (pause) did you clean up in here?
of course.

so, then you can stay as long as you want.
oh no. do not, do not, do not start packing. come on! (she puts some clothes into her bag, and ross throws them out.)
yeah, i know, i uh, i tried them on.
no. no, i did not. i did not want to be that guy.
(entering, wearing santa pants) hello!
ho! ho! ho!
excuse me.

oh, yeah! you like ‘them? i just, i went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. these are sooo comfortable!
uhh, pheebs, those are uh, those are santa pants.
what?
santa pants. (phoebe still does not get it.) santa claus’s pants.
nuh-uh! they are maternity pants. they even came with a list of baby names. (pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who is been naughty and who is been nice.) see, these names are good, and these names are bad. (finally, she figures it out.) ohh.
(entering) hey!
(entering) hey!
so—hey, pheebs! so, how are the elves?
i do not know! how are the-the-the-the, y’know—you are clothes are not funny.
hey, guys, what-what should i wear to a knicks game?
uhh, a t-shirt that says, "i do not belong here."
you have knicks tickets?
yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
yeah, apparently, they are pretty good seats.
yeah.
(examining the tickets) oh my god! those are almost right on the floor!
do you guys want these?
yeah!
yeah we do!
ohh, well you got ‘them.
just give us our apartment back!
boy! i did not see that coming!
are you serious?
oh, come on! we know what these are worth.
yeah, what, do you think we are stupid?
you are not stupid. you are meaner than i thought.
what do you say?
forget it! okay, I am not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
you are bachelor pad?!
have you even had a girl up here?
no. but uh, joey has, and i usually talk to them in the morning time.
yeah, you do!
come on!
(ignoring him) yes, gunther, can i get two cups of chino, please?
come on, season tickets! season tickets, do you know what that means?
forget it! okay, I am not giving up the apartment.
oh come—look, when i was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? my dad never won! of course, he was not in the sales division, but still, i never ever, ever forgot that!
(entering) hey, guys! (they both notice his new little friend)
hey!
oh my god!
we do not make enough fun of you already?
oh yeah, emily convinced me to do it.
you do know that wham broke up?
i like it, and emily likes it, and that is what counts. so uh, how are you guys doing?
oh-no, do not try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
where is emily?
ugh, she is saying good-bye to her uncle.
man, did not she like just get here?
yeah!! yeah!
easy tiger.
i just, i hate this so much! i mean, every time i go pick her up at the airport, it is-it is so great. but at the same time I am thinking, "well, I am going to be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
so what are you going to do?
nothing! there is nothing to do! i mean, she lives there, i live here. i mean, she-she would have to uh, move here. she should move here!
what?
i could ask her to live with me!
are you serious?
i mean, why not! i mean, i mean why not?!
because you have only known her for six weeks! okay, I have got a carton of milk in my fridge I have had a longer relationship with!
look guys, when I am with her it is-it is-it is like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. i mean i-i-i love her, y’know?
and i love the milk! but, I am not going to some british girl to move in with me! (realizes that made no sense.) joey, you say things now.
all right look, ross, he is right. emily’s great, she is great! but this way too soon, you are only going to scare her!
i do not want to do that.
no! you do not want to wreck it, you do not want to go to fast!
yeah, no, you are right, i know, you are right, I am not, I am not going to do it. all right, thanks guys. (gets up to leave.)
okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
that is too hard. too hard!
(entering with rachel) all right boys, last chance for the tickets!
or I will give them to my new boyfriend, joshua.
no thank you.
wait-wait-wait-wait! (to chandler) come on! come on, let us trade! the timing’s perfect, i just clogged the toilet!
look, i want those basketball seats as much as you do! okay, but we can not leave in the small apartment after we have lived here! did not you ever read flowers for algernon?
yes! did not you ever read sports illustrated?! no! i did not read yours! but come on, we can go to the game tonight!
look, the only way i will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
it is the knicks!
screw the knicks!
whoa!
i did not mean that. i just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
huh.
and the knicks rule all.
yeah, the knicks rule all!
hey, so? are you going to do it?
no. no. we are not going to do that, y’know why? because its not an even trade.
all right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
done!
let me finish.
oh.
I am talking about a bet, winner takes all.
ooh, we could end up with nothing.
or you could end up with everything.
ooh, i like that.
all right, so what do you say?
no!
oh, just do it!!
op, op, I am convinced!
come on man, you know I would do it for you! because, you are my best friend.
all right, but you can not use that again for a whole year. I am in.
all right!
ooh, this is so exciting! ooh, god, what are you going to bet?
oh, okay, well, i think we should let phoebe decide, because she is the only who is impartial, and she is so pretty.
okay. umm, ooh, ooh—oh, i have a game!
okay!
okay!
this is great!
what is the game?! what is the game?!
oh, well, it does not have a name—oh, okay, phoebeball! no, it does not have a name. umm, okay, monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
they are green?
good! good! five points!
all right, joey, same question.
uhh, they are tall.
ooh, three points. both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
that is not even a game!
what? shut up! we are winning!
you want to finish this right now? all right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. what do you say?
fine, let us do it.
oh, i have cards!
oh.
oh, good.
yeah! here! (she grabs a deck out of her purse) oh no, these are the trick deck. okay. here yes. okay.
okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
okay.
okay. (she picks a card.) four.
that is a low one!
yeah! okay. (joey picks a card.) phoebe, you look, i can not.
what make you think i can?! (shields her eyes from it.)
okay. okay. (he looks at the card.) ace!
why are you screaming and hugging?
because we won our apartment back!
what? ace is high! jack, queen, king, ace!
no! ace is low! ace, two, three, four!
i do not know. ooh! ooh! look it! (she fans out the trick deck.) ah-ha!
all right, cut, let us pick again, pick again.
okay.
come on apartment! come on apartment! (picks a card.) oh! i know queen is high!
uh-huh, not as high as…(picks a card) it worked! king!
yeah baby!
but, we pick again! we pick again!
why?!
i do not know!
tickets please! (rachel hands over the tickets) that is courtside baby!
seriously, good game though. good game. (he tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (to chandler) what are they so mad about? they get the apartment back!
no they did not!
hey!
(laughs) move in with me.
do not be scared, i-i know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it is too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
i know.
well, so, you-you will get a job here! i mean, I am always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing american jobs; that could be you!
no, i can not. i would, i really would, but my son is here; i can not leave him. is not—you do not think there is any way?
what?
no, no, do not. why do not we?
get married.
no! no! I am not! it is-it is-it is perfect! i mean it is better than you just-just moving here, ‘because it is us together forever, and that is-that is what i want.
yeah, i know, so what? i mean, who is-who is to say? does that me we-we can not do it? look, huh, i was with carol for four years before we got married and i wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. i mean, this, this makes sense for us. come on! i mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in vermont! i mean, last night i got my ear pierced! me! this feels right. does not it?
is that—are you saying yes? is that yes?
yes! we are getting married?!
yes!
come here, come here. uh, (he takes the earring out.) ow! emily, will you marry me?
damn! i thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
those were like the best seats ever.
oh yeah. hey! should we give these shirts to the girls? y’know, kind of like a peace offering.
oh yeah, that is very nice. plus, y’know they were free and they are too small.
oh. oh, god! (he starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)
hey, want a beer? (hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (jumping up.) whoa!!!!
i know!!!
open up! open up! open up!
we will discuss it, in the morning! (slams the door shut.)
what the hell is going on?!
we took our apartment back!! (slams the door shut.)
(opening the door) i had nothing to do with it. (closes the door.) (opens the door.) okay, it was my idea, but i do not feel good about it.
we are switching back, right now!
no, we are not! we are not leaving!
well, you are going to have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we are switching it back! there is nothing you can do to stop us! right, joe?
i do not know.
what?
i do not want to move again!
i do not care, this is our apartment! and they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! and i am getting it back right now. I am getting back right now!
all right. we figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
oh no-no-no, no more offers. you can not offer anything to us!
let us keep the apartment and…
as a thank you, rachel and i will kiss for one minute.
totally worth it!
that was one good minute!
good night.
good night.
men are such idiots.
yeah! can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
that is so funny to think if you would just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
yeah, let-let-let us pretend that is not true.
yeah.
okay, scarf’s done. (it is not really a scarf, it is just a bunch of yarn that phoebe has tied together. just then, ross and emily enter dragging with them joey and chandler.)
come on! come on. come on.
okay!
hey!
hey!
what-what is going on?
ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
uhh, okay, it is uh, emily and i, we decided to uh, to get married.
what? oh, are you pregnant too?!
when, when did—how, how did you…
we, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
(turning around.) umm, uh, i was just telling the guys…
yeah, i-i heard. (pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for rachel’s reaction.) i think it is great! (hugs ross.) ohh, I am so happy for you!
oh, well, that is great!
yeah! yeah!
(to ross) i can not believe you are getting married!
yeah. (they hug again.)
monica and rachel made out. (giggles like a schoolboy and monica glares at him.)
hey! (singing) get into gear!
(happily) okay!
ok, so this is pretty much what is happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like "forget about her" but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, "oh my god." so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she did not know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh-oh! so, that is pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been?
oh my god. oh my god. (she decides to make a break for it.) excuse me. move! move! emergency! excuse me! (she tries climbing over a bench and falls down.)
(seeing her) rach!
oh, there you are! hi! oh, so, so, how was china, you? (hits him with the flowers.)
it was, it was great. oh, what happened?
what?
you are bleeding.
i am? oh, look at that, yes i am. enough about me, enough about me, mr. back from the orient. come on. i want to hear everything! everything. (looks at julie)
well, where do i start? this is julie. julie, this is rachel.
these are, these are not for you. (to julie) these are for you. (loudly, thinking she can not speak english.) welcome to our country.
ok, well, not a problem. we will just use them to stop the bleeding. ok. baggage claim? ok.
 no way!
I am telling you, she went to the airport, and she is going to go for it with ross!
oh my god. this is huge. this is bigger than huge. this is like, all right, what is bigger than huge?
um, this?
yes.
guys, you got your hair cut.
yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay.
because, you know, (in that voice) if you do not look good, we do not look good. i love that voice.
(entering, out of breath) airport, airport. ross, not alone, julie, arm around her. cramp, cramp.
ok, i think she is trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs.
(to chandler) you, you, you said he liked me. (ross and julie enter) you, you slowpokes!
that is all right, rach, we got the bags. hi, hello. julie, this is my sister monica. this is chandler.  phoebe.  joey, what up?
what up?!
everyone, this is julie.
(out of breath) julie.
and bus.
 the screaming guy?
you got to hear this story.
200 at least.
and the chicken pooped in her lap. oh, I am so sorry. i just gave away the ending, did not i? oh! it is just, i just heard this story in the cab, and it is all i can think about.
this is amazing. i mean, how, how did this happen?
but we have not seen each other since then. well i land in china, guess who is in charge of the dig.
julie! julie, is not that great? i mean, is not that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
(to julie) it is an expression.
well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we are going to go see the baby.
yeah, it is really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
well, listen, do not tell us what is going to happen though, because i like to be surprised.
bye. (she closes the door and everyone tries to sympathize with her.)
hey, rach, can i get some coffee?
yeah, sure.
thank you.
hey, rach, can i get...
did you talk to him?
not yet.
then, no.
so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it is never going to happen, move on. you know whose voice that was?
god?
it was you, pal.
well, maybe it was god, doing me.
look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that is all. but then i met julie, and i do not know, we are having a great time. and i have to say, i never would have gone for it with her if it had not been for you.
well, you owe me one, big guy.
(to ross) here is your lemonade.
i did not order lemonade.
oh. well then, you better go take that back because they are going to charge you for that.
but...
go-go-go-go, come on! (ross goes over to the counte) (to chandler) so uh, what did you find out?
he said...he said, he said that they are having a great time. I am sorry. but, the silver lining, if you want to see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  without any outside help whatsoever.
how is that the silver lining?
you have to really want to see it.
ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
pheebes, you know what I am thinking?
oh, ok. how, it is been so long since you have had sex, you are wondering if they have changed it?
no, although now that is what I am thinking.
all right, so what were you thinking?
well, i was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, i thought, maybe you would like to do mine?
ohh! no.
why not?
because, I am just, I am incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
no you are not.
i know I am not, but you are, and i was trying to spare your feelings.
(answering the phone) hello? oh, hi. yeah, hold on a second. ross, it is julie, for you. (throws him the phone.)
(on phone) hello? hi.
(entering) hi. anybody know a good tailor?
needs some clothes altered?
no, no, I am just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
why do not you go see frankie? my family's been going to him forever. he did my first suit when i was 15. no wait, 16. no, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) all right, when was 1990?
okay.  you have to stop the q-tip when there is resistance!
(on phone) ok, ok, sweetheart, I will see you later. ok, bye. what? (sits down next to rachel) oh, that is so sweet. no, no, ok, you hang up. ok, ok, one, two, three. (does not hang up and motions for rachel to be quiet) well you did not hang up either.
she did not hang up either!
ok, no, no, you hang up. you, you, y...
(taking the phone and hanging it up) sorry, i thought you were talking to me.
rachel! I will just call her back.
okay!
(calls julie back) hi?  sorry, we got disconnected... (walks away.)
(to monica) ok, ok, ok. how did this happen to me? how did this happen to me? a week ago, two weeks ago, i was fine. ross was just ross, just this guy. now he is rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that i can not have.
sweetie, i wanted you to have him too.
i know you did. I am just going to deal with it, I am just going to deal with it. (ross comes by, smoching with julie on the phone.) i got to get out of here. (exits)
ok, i do not care what you guys say, something is bothering her.
(to chandler) you know, i think i was sixteen.
(to phoebe) please, just a little bit off the back.
I am still on "no."
(poking her head in from her bedroom) uh, morning. do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
no-no-no-no-no, (grabs his pants) I am not fallin' for that again.
what is going on?
well, i sorta did a stupid thing last night.
what stupid thing did you do?
ewww! (gets up and walks away.)
ok, paulo, why do not you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye. (paulo goes into his room.)
rachel, how did this happen?
i do not know, i just kind of ran into him last night.
where?
at his apartment. is this juice?
whoa, whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe?
oh god, i know I am a pathetic loser.
honey, you are not pathetic, you are sad.
people do stupid things when they are upset.
my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i had not...(everyone looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.
hi. sorry we are late but we were—well, there was touching.
hey, paulo. what are you doing here?
(to rachel) so, uh, he is back.
yeah, he is back. is that a problem?
no, not a problem.
good! I am glad it is not a problem.
(to paulo) ok, you are going to have to not touch my ass.
well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I have got pants that need to be altered.
hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello. he will know what it means.
are you sure he is going to be able to crack that code?
(to phoebe) you know it is funny, the last time paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
all right. ok, but, but!  you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and monica about it.
i promise.
all right. (talking to monica's hair.) now some of you are going to get cut, and some of you are not. but i promise none of you are going to feel a thing.
all right, that is it, i quit.
what? i did not say anything.
yeah, but this (makes monica's face) is not the face of a person who trusts a person. ok, this (makes monica's face) is the face of a person who, you know, does not trust a person.
I am sorry. I am sorry, phoebe. it is just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
would you relax? i know what i am doing. this is how he wears it.
how who wears it?
demi moore.
demi moore is not a he.
well, he was a he in arthur, and in ten.
that is dudley moore. i said i wanted it like demi moore.
oh.  oh!
oh my god!
oh my god!
oh my god!
oh my god! I am sorry, I am sorry. which one's demi moore?
she is the actress that was in disclosure, indecent proposal, ghost!
oh, she is got gorgeous hair.
i know!
at least as long as i have the pants.
how is she?
it is too soon to tell. she is resting, which is a good sign.
how is the hair?
I am not going to lie to you, ross, it does not look good. i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
can we see her?
your hair looks too good, i think it would upset her. ross, why do not you come on in.
 yeah. (gets up, but then pauses when he realizes what that meant.)
how are you doing?
I am okay.
ooh, that bad, huh?
what?
look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. it is one of my gifts.
when i saw him get off that plane with her, i really thought i hit rock bottom. but today, it is like there is rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
you got to tell ross how you feel.
come on. how can i just tell him? what about julie?
what about her? they have only been going out for two weeks. ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
i do not know, i do not know.
look, rach, rach! I have been with my share of women. in fact, I have been with like a lot of people's share of women. the point is, I have never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you.
(entering, angry) yo, paisan! can i talk to you for a sec? (pause) your tailor is a very bad man!
frankie? what are you talking about?
(entering from the bedroom) hey, what is going on? (pats chandler on the shoulder which causes him to jump.)
joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
what?
no way. I have been going to the guy for 12 years.
oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
what?
cupping.
that is how they do pants! first they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. (chandler and ross stare at him) what? ross, ross, would you tell him? is not that how they measure pants?
yes, yes it is. in prison! whatsa matter with you?
what? that is not? (realizes) oh my god.
even mary tyler moore would have been better.
i like it. i do, i think it is a ten. (chandler laughs.)
thank you. my hair is very amused.
come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it is crazy, but it is true.
(to chandler and ross) thank you.
well, i got to go. bye. bye, rach.
(sticking her head in from the balcony) wait, are you leaving?
yeah, that is kind of what i meant by "bye!"
well, can i talk to you for a sec?
okay. (goes out onto the balcony)
hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
that is ok.
what is going on?
well, first of all, paulo and i are not back together. it was just a stupid thing i did, and if i could go back in time and do it again, well, i would not. um, second of all (ross is laughing), what?
ok. well, before i say anything, i just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then i tell you what i think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and i look like a complete idiot?
no. no-no-no-no.
well, then, i think, i think the guy is scum. i hate him. i mean i actually—i-i physically hate him. i always have. you are way too good to be with a guy like that.
really?
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? someone who wakes up every morning thinking "oh my god, I am with rachel". you know, someone who makes you feel good, the way i am with julie. (rachel has moved closer, but hearing that she starts to back up.) was there a second of all?
no, i think that was the whole all.
okay.  okay. (they hug.) okay.
i swear to god, dad. that is not how they measure pants.
oh yeah!  oh, i can do that.
you want to do it right now?
(to rachel) ok, i just want to be really sure this time. andie mcdowell's the girl from four weddings and a funeral, right?
no. no no no no no. that is rodney mcdowell. andie mcdowell is the guy from planet of the apes.
oh, yeah. ok, thank you.
you are welcome.
so, you and rachel tonight, huh?
yeah. it is actually our first official date
wow! so tonight may be the night! you are nervous?
naa, no. this is the part I am actually good at.
what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
(pause) it is ok!
how can you be so confident?
well, i... i know exactly what I am going to do!
really? like you have a routine?
no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have to appreciate their uniqueness.
really?
no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. then, i kiss her. next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh.
you mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)
no! not like that, no no. no, like this. (he starts lightly grazing chandler's thigh)
oh, i see what you mean, that is quite nice. (they look at each other, both embarassed)
more foosball?
...and beer!!
(entering) hey!
(to chandler) hey sweetie! (they kiss)
(looking at monica's legs) wow!
hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop staring at your sister's legs!
I am sorry, it is just... how did you get so tan?
she went on one of those spray-on tan places.
eh, you got a spray-on tan?
chandler gets pedicures!
(laughing) why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
(to monica) why...why?
still, i can not believe that is sprayed on... i mean, it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one!
sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
so, do you get colours or just french tips?
there. here is their card.
thanks. (he takes the card) hey, i know where this place is! it used to be an x-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)
hey!
hey pheebs!
hey phoebe!
oh, you will not believe who moved back to town.
i know, amanda! ah! she called me too! she is the worst!
who is amanda?
she is this girl who used to live in the building before you did. then she moved to england and she picked up this fake british accent. on the machine this is her message. (she apes amanda using an awful british accent) "monica, darling! it is amanda calling!"
are you trying to do a british accent?
(pause) (to phoebe) chandler gets pedicures!
just so i know, how many more of those can i expect?
you know what amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes amanda in a british accent) "oh, so sorry to catch you on your mo-bile!" if-if you do not want to get me on my mo-bile, do not call me on my mo-bile!"
i know, and she is always bragging about all the famous people she is met.
oh, i know! "oh...i slept with billy joel". all right, who has not?
oh, what are we going to do! i do not want to see her!!
ugh, let us just cut her out!
what?
cut her out of our lives! just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
oh, i guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to chandler) have you ever done that?
no, had it done to me though. feels good !
well... i like how you look, what are you?
two, i think a two.
spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
well, i have a phd, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement)
one mississipi, two mississipi, three mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) wait! wait! I am not-I have not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)
you sprayed my front twice!
no, i barely even got to three mississippi.
mississippilesly? (pause) well, how bad is it?
so, how dark is it going to get?
I am a four?
(sarcastically) really!
(annoyed) ok!
wait, wait a minute, there is no light on the back wall! how do i know when it is going to start? hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) the same thing happened again!
(hysterically) I am an eight!
thanks for dinner.
i thought you paid. (rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) ha, guess we will not be going back there!
so.
yeah.
hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
i say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.
what is the matter?
i am sorry, i do not know, i am sorry, i do not know why i did that!
ok, so sorry.
i am sorry! again... i do not know, i do not know what happened, i must be nervous!
i do not get it, chandler loved it!
ok, ok, ok. i promise, i promise, i promise, i will not do it again. i really do. i promise. this is going to be great.
ok.
(a little giddy) uh, was that good for you?
(to phoebe) no, no, do not get it. let the machine pick up.
oh, yeah. could be rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
it could be amanda!
oh, you are right! i was just kidding about rachel. babysitting is a gas!
you are from yonkers! your last name is buffo-martisis!
ok, do not hold thy breath!
hello? is someone on the line?
hang on, she is right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to monica) someone is on the phone, for ya.
we were not picking up, it is amanda!
(to amanda) i get pedicures!
hi amanda! actually now... it is... is not a good time. dinner tomorrow night? (phoebe mouths 'no') ok, phoebe and i will see you then!
why, why, why did not you just say no!
well, i said 'no' to her coming over now! i could not say 'no' twice! i get this uncontrollable need to please people!
(leaving) fine, fine! you would not hold up well under torture!
and you would?
i did!
rach, you sure you want to do this?
absolutely! absolutely. i d... it is just a little weird, it is you, and it is me, it is just going to take some getting used to.
ok. well, how, how can we make it easier?
ok, let us work from the top down! (joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) just work the bra, joe!
ok, yeah, got it.
this thing welded shut?!
okay.
all right, turn around, i got to get a look at this thing.
oh!
ow!
sorry!
well this is romantic!
I am sorry! (he stands up) this never happened to me before! I am an expert at taking off bras! i can do it with one hand! i can do it with my eyes closed! one time i just looked at one, and it popped open! i blame your bra!
it is a standard issue bra clasp!
then i blame you! yeah! that is right! you threw me off with all your slapping!
ok well, well I am really, I am sorry about that joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you do not want to take off my bra?
(contemplates for a few moments what rachel just said) nah! i do not have another level!!
hold on! there is something different.
i went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
was that place... the sun?
oh! and it gets worse! (turns his side to chandler and monica and pulls up his shirt. there is a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)
oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory all by yourself!
how could you mess this up? it is so easy? you go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
(looks at her suspiciously) how do you count to five?
one two three...
(yells) damnit! (goes to the door to leave. rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)
(laughing) oooh! oh oh!
(still yelling) i know!
oh oh! what is up with miss hawaiian tropic?
how was your date with joey?
well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and i kept slapping it away!
you did not like that?
well, it was not just me, alright? he freaked out too! he could not even undo my bra!
wow, really? one time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
i do not know what is wrong with us, i mean, we have kissed before and that is been great! but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me.
well, you guys have been friends forever. remember the first time that you kissed ross? how weird that was? you could not stop laughing? you got through that.
(looking thoughtful) ok, that is true. that is true, we can do this. you are right, you are right, we can do this. we are just going to power through!
hey chandler can i talk to you for a second (points to the hall).
(to joey) no need!! problem solved, we are powering through (at which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).
(sees what he is doing) chandler, stop! it is not going to pop open!
(without taking his eyes off the bra) you do not know! (monica just smiles)
hey phoebe!
hey!
is amanda here yet?
no.
(sits down) oh good. good, look I am so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. but i have a new plan. chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
oh! well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
well, what do you think of mike and chandler being in a car accident?
(makes a face) are you kidding, i love it!
hi!
hi!
(beaming) yeah! yeah! his name is chandler and...
musty!
when were we not friends?
ehm, we were friends in 1992.
(to phoebe) you were going to cut me out?
well...kind of.
oh my god!
yeah well, in america you are just an "ass".
(into the phone) hello? chandler, what is wrong? (she listens) oh my god, are you alright? (listens some more) yeah, I will be right there. (she hangs up and speaks to amanda) I am so sorry, but chandler was in a car accident. (she gets up)
(also gets up and starts taking her purse) oh my god. was mike with him?
nope! (she turns and leaves)
(to rachel) hey!
hey! got champagne?
yes madam, ready to power through!
excellent! stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...
uh! (when she is done she throws her bra at him)
ok (starts to light some candles) sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (claps her hands and jumps at joey, clearly very excited) alright! let us do it!
ok, you are scaring me a little bit.
oh! get over it soldier, we have got to do this! (she pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) ok. aha! you like that huh?
oh! yeah!
you like that? (she climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to joey's hips.) let us take this into high gear (she pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. she puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)
uh uh!
yeah baby, I will show you how we do it!
no, no, no! you kneed me in my misters!
what? oh my god! I am so sorry. joey? are you ok?
(he just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) soldier down!
we are not friends with phoebe anymore.
if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!
oh chandler! thank god you are alive. monica, can i talk to you outside for a minute?
i have nothing to say to you.
please, monica? in the hall?
well, are not you a treat.
i can not believe you tried to cut me out. why phoebe, why?
it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
I am still all those things!
you are also so generous and kind and scrappy!
(starts smiling) i am scrappy.
exactly! look, no matter what i tried to do, i could not keep you out of my life. of all the people i have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
it is because I am scrappy.
yeah, you are. and I am so glad that you fought your way back in, because i do not know what i would do without you.
i will not know what i would do without you.
well, i guess we should go back in. when you gave me another chance, i guess we should do the same for amanda.
yeah, i guess you are right.
I am going to stop you right there, glenda. okay? does it look like this is my first time, huh? now i want 4 two's... and i want them all on my back.
wait a minute, there is two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
which... which... which... which one is it?
oh! son of a bitch!
what is the matter with us?
well, i know what is the matter with me.
no, i mean with us, you know. i mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?
i do not know.
that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... hey!
hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
kind of... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
no, no, no... no, i mean... se-x-you-ally...
yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt like uhm... i can not believe we have not been doing this the whole time.
i can tell from your expressions that that is the good news you were hoping for... well, I am going to go continue to... spread the joy.(chandler leaves the apartment. joey sighs)
well, just because it happened that way for them does not mean it has to happen that way for us.
yeah, yeah... absolutely. i mean, just because something is difficult does not mean that you quit.
right, totally.
yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
yeah, and if does not work, then we will be just one of those couples that never have sex.
that is a... pla-an.
(sighs) wow... i did not see this coming.
i know.
i do not get it. i mean, i was so sure this was what i wanted.
hmmm... me too...
i wonder how monica and chandler could do it?
i guess they were not as good friends as we are.
aah... i bet you are right.
so...
yeah.
i love ya.
love you too... alright, I am going to bed.
yeah, me too.
ooh, yeah, I am not going anywhere for a while.
dude, it is chandler. let me in.
go away! i do not want to see anybody.
i know, i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. you have to let me in.
really? did you count mississipily?
dude, you are not tanned.
no, i just had to get a picture of this.
i see you later!
there is this woman, that i like.  a lot.  well, it is complicated.  she is with this other guy.  for a long time.  and i could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’ccause we are really good friends.
so, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?
yeah, he is the best.
then talk to him! he might be fine with it.
oh, i do not know.
joey, it is worth finding out. i mean, if you really like her.
i do! so much! i can not stop thinking about her! i can not sleep, i—
okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it. how often does this happen to you, huh? you owe it to yourself. (walks towards the door until…)
it is rachel.
(closes the door) did you um—I am sorry, did you just say it is rachel?
yes.
um, you…you like rachel?
yes. i like rachel.
rachel?!
(startled) yeah, okay but look, buy uh—hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else i like? you! and it-it does not get said enough. i like you ross.
but r-r-rachel-rachel?!
yeah, but it is not a big deal.
it is not a big deal? oh, I am sorry i just…um, i…what about all the stuff you-you just said? i mean how about, i like—you-you can not stop thinking about her. like how you can not sleep?
I am an actor, y’know? as-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
rachel who is carrying my baby? rachel?
look no, i-i know it is bad, and i know it is wrong. okay? but-but it is not like anything’s ever going to happen. y’know? these-these are just feelings, they are going to go away.
y’know what? i-i got to go. (starts to leave.)
oh come on ross! hey ross-ross do not…
(stops) i just—y’know—i-i just have one—rachel?!
oh-oh! okay, she is kicking!
oh! (puts his hand on her belly.) she is growing inside you.
whoa!!
oh! (pulls his hand away.)
wow that was a big one.
i think that is the youngest girl ever to reject me.
(entering) oh hey you guys!
oh hey!
hi!
hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
oh yes i do. i do. i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. and do you know how you find him? you stop looking for him. that is why i stopped looking for russell crowe. he will find me.
uh-huh, (to chandler) and you?
no. i mean i believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love, but soul mates, i do not think they exist.
okay, good.
why?
well last night, i met monica’s.
what?
yeah, i had a date with this guy, and i swear to god, he is her other half.
come on, do not be crazy. (to rachel) you do not think there is someone out there better suited for monica than me, do ya? (rachel looks at him.)
(to phoebe) well, what is he like?!
well he is tall.
uh-huh.
he has brown hair.
of course, of course.
a tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
he works with food!
oh sure. older?
obviously, and he is british.
oh, i was just going to ask!
yeah? and, he is-he is so centered and mature and confident.
oh, it is so sad they never had a chance to meet.
luckily, the guy she settled for can not hear what you are talking about.
oh, I am so sorry. um, and maybe I am wrong! i but—y’know I am going to go out with him again, I will find out more.
you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you are still going to date him?
well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s got to eat.
hey.
hey.
i just talked to joey, i just—i want to see how you were.
oh y’know, i still—i can not believe it. joey and rachel i mean it is… it is like you and me going out, only weirder!
all right, i know you are hurting, and-and i want to be supportive, but do not say that again.
oh my god! what if, what if they get married? then he would be the stepfather of my child.
honey, i do not think that is something we need to worry about! first of all he is-he is never going to tell her how he feels about her. and even if he did you have no idea how she would react.
sure, because women never like joey. y’know, i think he is a virgin.
joey…he is not even thinking about going after rachel!
he is not?
no! all he is thinking about is how you are taking this! i mean, listen it is totally freaking him out. he is talking about moving to vermont.
why?
he says he wants to leave the country. (pause) he thinks you hate him.
hate him? i… no, i do not hate him. (pause) it is just it is rachel, y’know?
honey i can not even imagine how hard this must be for you. but, i do not want you to lose joey over it. and right now he just needs to know that you are still his friend.
okay. okay, I will talk to him.
all right. now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money.
oh! hi!
hi!
umm, chandler, monica, this is don.
(mouths to chandler) soul mate.
(mouths to phoebe) what?
(cough talks) soul mate.
so, what have you guys been doing?
i know! what is this, 1985?!
not really.
what is wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (everyone stares at him.) on a barbecue chicken pizza? (still there is staring.) no?
so don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
oh my god! that is my restaurant, I am the chef there.
no!
oh, I would like a latte. oh y’know what? if you are going to talk about me, I am going to go with you.
what are you doing?!
nothing! i swear to god i did not know you guys would be here! and the good news is you did not believe in soul mates. so…
i believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
they are just talking, and y’know what? just because i think they are soul mates does not mean anything’s going to happen.
(returning) phoebe, good work.
yeah?
yeah! oh he is great, i love him. (walks away and chandler glares at phoebe.)
do not worry, we will find you someone else.
hey.
hey.
look, i understand if you came by to hit me, i deserve it.
no, i do not want to hit you.
oh what then? kick me?
no.
(getting worried) bite me?
no, no i do not want to do anything to you. all right? i just want to tell you that I am not mad at you and…and that i certainly do not hate you. i just, i just came here to say that. (starts to leave.)
oh now—hey ross-ross! do you want to-want to come in for a beer or something?
uh…yeah sure. (enters.)
do uh, do you got any beer? all-all i got is this melon stuff that rachel left. i do not…
okay.
(pouring two glasses) hey look ross, you need to understand something okay? i uh…i am never going to act on this rachel thing, okay? i-i would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (he hands ross a glass.)
thank you.
anyway, it uh…look it will just…take me a while to get over her, that is all. I am not even sure how to do that, i mean I have never been in love before so…
what?! you are in love with her.
yeah, i thought you knew that.
umm, no.
wow. hey look, if it helps, i do not want to feel this way. honest. i just keep thinking, "ah, I will get over this." y’know? i just—it just keeps gettin’ harder. i do not, i do not know what to do. y’know? what do i do?
i think you need to tell her how you feel.
okay that is the green stuff talkin’.
no, I am serious. you-you need to find out where she is, because if she is not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
but what if uh—and I am not saying she will be—but…
if she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it should not stand in the way.
are you sure?
yeah. look if-if she is going to end up with somebody else, the truth is she could not find a better guy. so…
hey thanks.
so when do you think you are going to talk to her?
oh my god i have to tell her! i have not even thought about what i will say. what should i say?
I am understanding, but let us not get carried away.
I am sorry, you are right. what am i going to say? (he takes another sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) oh!
yeah, tell me about it. (he stands up, turns his back to joey, and enjoys another sip.)
cheese you say? that is some pretty smelly work, huh don?
cheese, it is smelly. you must smell a lot of the time too.
me too! yeah, chandler can not stand it. he will not even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
you know what I would love to do? i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheese—not even bread, just cheese. no, i want the bread. yeah. ah, and pastries… (breathlessly) and pate. oh, I am really not high, it is just i used to be fat.
is it made of cheese?
I would move in tomorrow!
(disgusted) oh come on! (to phoebe) are you listening to this?
I am so sorry.
what do we do?
i do not know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! i do not know how you fight that.
okay. okay, i can do this. i can tell her how i feel. just uh, just stand up straight. (does so.) take a couple deep breaths. (does so.) look confident. (does so as rachel opens the door and startles him.)
joey? what is up?
i uh, i just came by because i-i want to talk to you about something.
okay what is up?
here? in the hall? what are we animals?
well honey, I am late for a meeting. so can you just make it quick?
okay umm, i just came by to tell you that i…want to have dinner with you tonight. that is all.
sure! that sounds great! just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. okay? (walks away.)
okay. that is good. okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you are going to say. good. yeah. (someone comes out of his apartment and it startles joey again.) do not you people ever knock?!
I would like to have don and phoebe over. would not that be nice?
sure, why do not you set it up. I will just be over here, browsing through the personals.
are you okay? you have been acting weird all afternoon.
yeah, fine. fine. not perfect!! but good enough.
jeez! what is with you?
I am sorry, did you say cheese?
all right, what is going on?
phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates, and i do not believe in that kind of stuff. but then you two totally get along. so look, i will not stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese.
chandler, you do not believe in soul mates?
no. but I am sure (mimics don) ‘tomatoes’ does.
i do not believe in soul mates either.
you do not?
no. i do not think that you and i were destined to end up together. i think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. some days we work really hard.
so you…you do not want to live with don in a cheese house?
no, I have had second thoughts about that. do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
i love you.
i know.
y’know what? i am going to take you out to dinner tonight. i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (monica does not look impressed.) no? really? they taste so good.
…and i know chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. i mean I am really worried the baby’s not going to like him. (joey is staring at the table.) are you okay?
what? yeah! sure! uh, look at the uh, the reason…(exhales slowly)—is it hot in here?
no. not-not for me, but why do not you take off your sweater?
i would, but this is a nice place and my t-shirt has a picture of calvin doing hobbs.
oh my god! really?! can i see it?
yeah. sure. (they both half stand up, joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and rachel looks down it to see his t-shirt.)
huh. wow, i would not think hobbs would like that so much.
uh… how long have we known each other?
um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. wow.
uh-huh, long time.
yeah.
but over the past few weeks…
actually uh, could you give us a second?
so you were saying?
I am not quite sure.
okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and i said, "eight years." and the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.
yeah, here we are. uhh… i… i think I am…falling in love with you.
(stunned) what?
I am falling in love with you.
(looking around) who are you talking too? oh, you are kidding! oh, it is a joke! (laughs.) it is funny. it is funny. i do not get it. (joey does not say any thing and rachel realizes it is not a joke.) oh. (pause) okay. umm… i-i…uh, wow. are you uh… how did umm… when?
does it really matter?
wow! wow. wow. wow, it is hot in here.
okay look rach, i know this is a lot. you do not have to say anything. you-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (long pause as rachel says nothing.) okay, you got to say something!
joey, joey i love you so much, but i…
but. (hangs his head down.)
joey.
yeah-yeah right. that is okay. that is fine. that is uh, pretty much what i was expecting. so uh, it is no big deal. all right? i think I am going to go. (stands up.)
no! joey please! please do not! please do not leave like this! now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (starts to cry.)
do not start doing that. you can not do that rach, ‘because then you are going to make me do that. (starts to cry.) oh, here we go! (sits down next to her.)
can i? (hug him.)
sure!
oh joey honey i do not…i do not want to lose…
hey-hey-hey, hey! you can not. okay? ever!
I am so sorry.
oh no-no rach, please, do not be sorry. okay? do not be sorry. (they hug again.) y’know i was only kidding you.
yeah, that was a real good one.
erica, are you okay?
oh my god!
relax! we will just get her some antacids.
she does not have a stomach-ache. she is in labor!
oh my god!
so if you think i did not say goodbye to you because you do not mean as much to me as everybody else, you are wrong. it is because you mean more to me.
rach!
what?!
hey.
shh.. go back to sleep. i have to go home.
oh. this was amazing.
it really was. you have learned some new moves!
yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "sex for dummies" as a joke.
ah.
who is laughing now?
i know!
breathe, breathe, breathe... good.
next time, can i say breathe?
no, last time you said it like dracula, and it scared her! can i get you anything? you want some more ice chips?
alright, I will be right back.
where are you going?
to use the bathroom.
you can not leave me alone with her.
what?
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with!
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
it is just that we have never spent any time, you know, alone together.
you will be fine. nah, you will not, but I will be back in two minutes.
okay.
so, ah... any plans for the summer?
hah. may not want to mention this. so, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
well, it is just interesting. you know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who knows? maybe there is something even more painful than those things? like this.
morning.
hey!
what is that?
it is my house-warming present for monica and chandler.
it is a baby chick and duck!
uh-huh. and i named them chick jr. and duck jr.
i did not see that coming.
yeah, i figure they will love it at the new house, you know? it has that big backyard. and then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to.
yes.
yeah. it is a shame people can not visit there.
that is the rule, though.
guess what? you are almost an uncle!
what?
yeah, erica went into labor last night. monica and chandler are at the hospital right now!
oh my god!
yeah, and i have a definite feeling it is going to be a girl.
phoebe, you were sure ben was going to be a girl.
have you seen him throw a ball?
is rachel here?
uh, i think she is still asleep. hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? she seemed pretty pissed at you.
uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
what is that smile? did something happen with you two?
hey, I am not one to kiss and tell, but I am also not one to have sex and shut up. we totally did it!
oh my god. you and rachel?
i know, it is pretty great.
so what does that mean? are you guys getting back together?
oh, i.. i do not know. we did not really get to talk.
but do you want to get back together?
i do not know. it was incredible. i mean, it just felt so right. when i was holding her, i mean, i never wanted to let her go. you know what? yeah, i do. i want to be together.
(screaming) yay!
shhh!
(quietly) yay!
so, so is she still going to paris?
wow, i had not thought of that. i hope not.
oh, this is like the best day ever. ever! you guys might get back together, monica and chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! oh, i feel like I am in a musical! (singing) "daa - raa... when the sun comes up, bright and beaming! and the moon comes..."
morning!
guess we will never know how it ends.
okay.
hey.
hey.
hey. how did you sleep?
good. you?
good.
i bet you did!
uh. would you guys mind giving us a minute?
sure, yeah. will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
chick and the duck? did not they die...
(interrupting) dive. yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
so...
morning.
you too. last night was just wonderful.
it really was.
i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
i know, me too. it was... you know, it was like one of those things you think is never going to happen, and then it does, and it is everything you want it to be.
uh-huh. i know. it was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (she hugs him, and ross looks crushed.)
it is just a little bit more, honey.
is it really that bad?
oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen! chandler, you have to see this!
I am okay.
chandler, you do not want to miss this. this is the birth of your child! it is the miracle of life!
alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
it is a... it is a boy!
wow!
oh, you did it!
(emotional) it is a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some other stuff I am going to pretend i do not see.
well, that is spongy.
(to her son) oh, hey handsome! oh, I am going to love you so much that no woman is ever going to be good enough for you! (to chandler, on the verge of tears) oh, we are so lucky!
i know. he has your eyes.
i mean, i know that is not possible, but he does.
okay.
(to erica) oh my god, he is beautiful. thank you so much.
how do you feel?
i... I am sorry, who should be along in a what now?
we only ordered one!
oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know!
well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good.
(to the doctor) wait, did you know it was twins?
(to erica) anybody tell you?
this is unbelievable.
interesting! (to monica) can i see you for a second?
what do we do?
what do you mean "what do we do"?
(panicking) twins! twins!!
chandler, you are panicking!
uh-huh! join me, will not you?! okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
we can not split them up!
why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they will find each other and be reunited. i mean, that is a great day for everybody.
okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
what if they are not? what if it is adopted by a king?
yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt.
monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
that does not matter! we have waited so long for this. i do not care if it is two babies. i do not care if it is three babies! i do not care if the entire cast of "eight is enough" comes out of there! we are taking them home, because they are our children!
(smiles) okay. shhh...
okay.
okay!
okay!
(shocked) she? it is a girl?
(to monica) well, now we have one of each! (to the doctor) and that is enough!
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
oh my god! what did you say?
nothing! what do you say to that?
ross, you have got to tell her how you feel!
no way!
you can not just give up! is that what a dinosaur would do?
what?
dude, I am just trying to speak your language.
ross, rachel does not know that you want to get back together. if she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go.
you really think so?
I am telling you! oh, okay! this is the part of the musical where there would be a really good convincing song. (singing) "bam-bam, do not take no for an answer. bam-bam, do not let love fly away. bam-bam-bam-bam..."
hi!
can not a girl finish a song around here?
hey!
hi! so i just dropped emma off at my mom's.
okay.
oh, you are not taking her with you tonight?
no, we decided that i would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday.
wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? good luck, mom.
are you kidding? eight hours with my mother talking about atkins? good luck, emma!
alright, you know what? you are right. i should at least tell her how i feel.
ross, wait!
what? what?
could you get me a muffin?
yeah?
(touched) gunther... oh... i love you too. probably not in the same way, but i do. and, and when I am in a café, having coffee, or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I will think of you. aw.
oh... bye guys.
oh my god!
unbelievable!
hey, you know what might help?
I am not getting you a muffin!
do you think they recognize each other from in there?
maybe. unless they are like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they are pushed through a vagina and they meet.
there is something that we want to tell you. we decided to name the girl-baby erica.
son of a gun, it is!
okay, well, bye!
bye!
we will call you!
have fun at church-camp!
oh, look at these little bunnies!
i know! you ready to trade?
okay.
okay.
alright, let us see..
we could trade later.
yeah, I am good.
hey, what are you working on?
it is a... it is a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
how sweet! oh, is that the baby?
no, i sat in the paint.
hey.
hey. so, did you talk to rachel?
no, and I am not going to.
what?
why not?
because she is just going to shoot me down. you guys saw what happened with gunther. that did not look like fun.
how can you compare yourself to gunther? i mean, sure, he is sexy in a more obvious way. you have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.
yeah, and she still wants to go! it is pretty clear where she is.
yeah, i know what you mean. i mean, sometimes...
uh, joe?
damn it!
look, even if i were going to tell her, i do not have to do it now. okay? I will be seeing her again. we have got time.
no, you do not! she is going to paris! she is going to meet somebody. do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it is... it is a city of gunthers!
hey! what do you have there?
oh my god! you did that yourself?
honey, that is gorgeous!
you know, the baby can not read, mike!
hi! you guys, the car-service just got here. i can not believe they are not home yet! i have to catch my stupid plane. i want to see the baby!
monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here any minute. and apparently, there is some big surprise.
yeah, did she sound happy about it? because my friend ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
oh my god!
oh my god!
hi! oh my gosh!
hey.
(to monica) hey, so what is the big surprise?
oh.
oh my god!
what... what...
okay, okay, awkward question. the hospital knows you took two, right?
yes, it is twins!
oh my god.
oh, they are so cute! now, what, what kinds are they?
(points at the baby she is holding) this is a boy, (points at the baby chandler is holding) and that is a girl.
her name is erica.
aw..
hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica.
yeah. it is a shame you two did not get to spend more time together.
yeah, we named the boy jack after dad.
aw, he is going to be so happy.
oh, jack bing. i love that. ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "jack bing, morning gazette. I am going to blow this story wide open!"
oh my gosh. wow, so beautiful.
oh yeah? well, tell me which one, and I will try slip it in my coat.
one? how about a whole bunch?
yeah! ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the von trapp family! only without the nazis. although that sounds kind of dull.
oh, you guys, i can not believe this. but I will leave now, or I am going to miss my plane.
I am just so glad you got to see the babies.
me too. oh, I am just sorry I am not going to be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! alright, i can not say goodbye to you guys again. i love you all so much.
i love you.
i love you.
call us when you get there.
i will. ross, come here.
i just want you to know.. last night.. I will never forget it.
neither will i.
alright, now i really have to go. okay. au revoir! oh, they are going to really hate me over there.
so, you just let her go?
yeah.
hey, maybe that is for the best.
yeah?
yeah. you know? you just... look, you got to... you got to think about last night the way she does, okay? maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
but now she will never know how he feels!
maybe that is okay. you know? maybe, maybe it is better this way? i mean, now, now you can move on. i mean, you have been trying to for so long, maybe now that you are on different continents.. (looks at phoebe) right?
maybe now you can actually do it. you know? you can finally get over her.
yeah, that is true. except i do not want to get over her.
what?
i do not! i want to be with her.
really?
yeah, I am going to go after her.
yeah, you are!
woo!
wait, wait! get your coat! get your coat!
my coat...
this is so cool!
i have no idea what is going on, but i am excited!
but ross, ross. what do you, what do you think she is going to say?
i do not know, but i.. look, even if she shoots me down, at least i will not spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. where - where is my coat?!
you did not bring one! my cab's downstairs, I will drive you to the airport.
okay, guys, wish me luck.
hurry!
good luck, good luck!
there is no seatbelt!
that is okay. if - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it is better if you are thrown from the car.
alright, alright, let us do this!
okay!
hey!
i - i do not take passengers.
no, you do not understand. this is not a real cab.
my medallion number is, "get out of the cab!"
(screaming) get out of the cab!
get out of the cab!
oh, hey, hey, can i give you guys your house-warming present now?
now, that you can do.
alright!
ah... chick jr.? duck jr.? do not hide from mama!
you can open your eyes now.
are we off the bridge?
yes.
is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
yes, she jumped right back up.
oh my god, phoebe, slow down!
do you want to get to rachel in time?
yes, but i do not want to die in your cab!
you should have thought of that before you got in!
toll-booth.
what?
(screaming) toll-booth! four bucks. there are quarters in the glove compartment.
hurry!
okay!
okay.
damn, that window is clean.
quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...
we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, i got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
really? you got us a chick and a duck?
oh, great! just what you want for a new house with infants. bird feces.
yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, because now they are gone!
oh, do not worry, we will find them.
actually, I am going to go check on the twins.
alright.
oh god! what did i just step on?
oh!
it is okay, it is just an egg roll.
oh..
you stepped on my egg roll?
I am sorry, i did not know to look for chinese food on the floor.
just put it on a plate and leave.
okay, let us find these birds.
alright.
wait, wait. do you hear that?
oh! they are in the table!
well, that can not be good!
we got to get them out of there!
how?
oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls?
oh, tons, I am quite the woodsman.
well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
joey, wait! the ball!
oh!
oh god! so what do we do?
i do not know. maybe we can open this up somehow.
okay.
no... it is all glued together.
does that mean we have to bust it open?
i do not know. maybe.
oh my god!
i know! it is.. it is the foosball table.
all right, you know what? we do not have a choice. it is like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if I would gotten the part. "those are our men in there, we have to get them out! even if i have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."
did that movie ever get made?
it did not.
ross, where are you going?
to talk to rachel, is not that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
what? what are you just going to walk up to her at the gate? have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
not since my cop-show got cancelled.
you have to get a ticket to get past security.
what? we are never going to make it!
not with that attitude! now, haul ass!
okay, if you could all walk slower, that would be great.
oh my god! i was so afraid i was not going to remember any of my high-school french, but i understood every word you just said!
oh.
oh, shoot. i had it. oh, i can not believe this.
i have it, i have it, i have it. oh, okay, i can not find it, but i remember that i was in seat 32c, because that is my bra-size.
okay, fine! but you know what? if i was in 36d, we would not be having this problem.
hey, i need a ticket.
just one? i drive you all the way down here, and i do not get to see how it works out?
fine, two tickets, i need two tickets.
we are on our honeymoon.
i do not care. whatever is the cheapest.
I am so lucky i married you.
oh! shoot! damn it! where is it? oh! oh! i found it! i found it!
hah! i found it! i told you i would find it! in your face! you are a different person.
okay, flight 421 to paris. i do not see it, do you see it?
no, did we miss it?
no, no, no. that is impossible. it does not leave for another 20 minutes.
maybe we have the flight-number wrong. god.
hello.
hey, it is me. here is ross.
what? hey, hey, listen..
oh my god! ross, you would not believe the cute little noises the twins are making. listen.
monica? monica, monica, monica, monica..?
oh, I am sorry. shoot, they were doing it before.
that is alright. listen, listen.
oh, wait, wait, wait! here they go again.
monica? monica, monica, monica, monica..?
is not that cute?
that is precious! listen! i need rachel's flight information.
oh, okay. alright, it is flight 421. leaves at 8:40.
yes, that is what i have. it is not on the board.
that is what it says here. flight 421, leaves at 8:40, newark airport.
what?
newark airport. why, where are you?
jfk.
(yelling) do not worry, you guys, we are going to get you out of there.
and we are also going to buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
okay. here goes.
what is the matter?
i need to say goodbye to the table first.
i understand.
okay. table, you have given us so many great times. and you guys, jordan, victor, joel... all of you guys. what can i say? you guys make us look good. you want to say anything?
i do not know. except that, for one last time... (he touches the players as he says the following) good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
okay, here we go. i can not do it.
well, i can not do it either.
hey! did you find them?
yeah, they are stuck inside the table!
we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
oh, well sure. this got to be so hard. I will do it. give me!
phoebe! wow! no, no, no!
well, I have never gone this fast before.
phoebe, forget it, okay? newark is - is like an hour away. there is no way we are going to make it in time.
she is got her cell, you could call her.
i am not doing this over the phone.
you do not have any other choice!
hello?
rachel? oh, good. hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
yeah.
(to ross) for what it is worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
yay.
uh, rach, hang on.
phoebe? is everything okay?
uhm, actually no. no, you have... you have to get off the plane.
what? why?
i have this feeling that something is wrong with it. something is wrong with the left philange.
oh, honey, I am sure there is nothing wrong with the plane.
alright, look, i have to go. i love you, and i will call you the minute i get to paris.
oh, that was just my crazy friend. she told me i should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left philange.
i would not worry about it. she is always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? she is almost never right.
well...
wait, what are you doing?
could i get some peanuts?
this is ridiculous! i...
yeah, okay.
alright. my job here is done.
that was... impressive.
yeah, you did not even use the tools for most of it!
yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get back to the babies. I will see you girls later.
sorry about the table, man.
yeah.
you going to buy a new one?
probably not. nah. i do not know how much I am going to want to play after you go.
well, at least we got these little guys out.
yeah.
aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
I am going to miss these little guys. it was nice having birds around again.
hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.
what?
yeah, i mean we have got a lot going on right now. and, plus, here they would have their own room.
i could get a goose!
you know, i - i think you are set with the poultry.
thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you are going to get to stay here! and, and it is good, you know, because, because now you have a reason to come visit.
i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
where is she?
i do not see her.
rachel! rachel green!
there she is!
rachel! rachel!
no, no, i just have to talk to someone.
no, no, no, but...
(screaming) rachel!!
oh my god... what.. what are you guys doing here?
okay, you are on.
what? what? ross, you are scaring me. what is going on?
okay, the thing is..
yeah?
do not go.
what?
please, please stay with me. i am so in love with you. please, do not go.
oh my god.
i know, i know. i should not have waited 'till now to say it, but I am.. that was stupid, okay? I am sorry, but I am telling you now. i love you. do not get on this plane.
hey, hey. i know you love me. i know you do.
i - i have to get on the plane.
no, you do not.
yes, i do.
no, you do not.
they are waiting for me, ross. i can not do this right now, I am sorry. I am sorry.
rachel?
I am so sorry.
i really thought she would stay.
I am sorry.
well, that is it. everything's packed.
wow, this is weird.
i know.
yeah. uh, does this mean there is nothing to eat?
i put three lasagnas in your freezer.
i love you!
hey!
hey.
so did you guys make it in time?
yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
where is ross?
he went home. he did not want to see anybody.
(on the answering machine) ross, hi. it is me. i just got back on the plane. and i just feel awful. that is so not how i wanted things to end with us. it is just that i was not expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you are there and saying these things... and... and now I am just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have said, and i did not. i mean, i did not even get to tell you that i love you too. because of course i do. i love you. i love you. i love you. what am i doing? i love you! oh, I have got to see you. I have got to get off this plane.
oh my god!
(on the answering machine) excuse me?
(on the answering machine) I am sorry. I am really sorry, but i need to get off the plane, okay? i need to tell someone that i love love them.
let her off the plane!
(on the answering machine) oh, please, miss, you do not understand!
try to understand!
(on the answering machine) oh, come on, miss, is not there any way that you can just let me off...
no! no! oh my god. did she get off the plane? did she get off the plane?
i got off the plane.
you got off the plane.
i do love you.
i love you too, and I am never letting you go again.
okay. because this is where i want to be, okay? no more messing around. i do not want to mess this up again.
me neither, okay? we are - we are done being stupid.
okay. you and me, alright? this is it.
this is it. unless we are on a break.
do not make jokes now.
okay, please be careful with that. it was my grandmother's. be careful.
if that falls off the truck, it would not be the worst thing.
wow.
i know. it seems smaller somehow.
has it always been purple?
(to his children) look around, you guys. this was your first home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
oh, yeah, that is true.
uh, i have not.
wait a minute. what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?
do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we would leave our keys.
oh, okay.
so, i guess this is it.
yeah. i guess so.
(crying) this is harder than i thought it would be.
oh, it is going to be okay.
(crying) do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
we got some time.
okay, should we get some coffee?
sure. where?
(looking up) ross, when is this comet thing start?
well, technically it seven billion years ago… (well, technically you would be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of new york.)
okay! okay! fine, I will stop! no teaching, okay? we will just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. (comets do not streak across the sky, meteors do.) okay? who is official name is bapstein-king.
(looking up) there it is! oh, look at that! is not mother nature amazing?
(looking up with her) that is a plane!
well, all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high, that is pretty amazing too.
no. no, you can not.
oh i do not-i do not know.
man, look at all those stars! (yeah, you can see what? five of them from the city?) infinite space. it really, really makes you wonder, does not it?
(looking through his binoculars at a nearby building) y’know what else makes you wonder?
huh?
check out the rack on this chick! (turns around to point it out to ross and finds that ross is glaring at him. so he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)
okay, we have been out here for two hours and we have not seen any stupid comets. can we go now? i mean, chandler’s getting chilly. (she walks over to where chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shivering.)
(with a quivering voice) no, I am not!
then why are you wearing monica’s jacket?
because it is flattering! (shivers harder) come on monica! come on monica! (he goes inside.)
yeah actually, i think we are going to take off too. we rented a movie.
oh! i will not say, ‘no’ to a movie!
uh pheebs, we just actually kind of wanted to be alone.
shh! get me out of here.
oh. (they leave, leaving just joey and ross.)
(whispering) ross!
what?
come here, check this out!
what? is it the comet? (runs over to where joey’s standing.)
no! no-no. look, there is a bug stuck in tar right here. (bends down to get a closer look.)
joey come—i can not believe—i bring you here to see the bapstein-king comet, one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
(standing up) y’know, there is two women dude.
show me where?
right-right up here. (starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
(noticing the pipe and looking at the door) joey where is the pipe that was holding the door open?
(annoyed) i do not know! (goes back to looking through the pipe.) (pause) yeah, i do.
joey!
what?! all right—hey! do not look at me! you are the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid burger king comet!
it is called the bapstein-king comet, okay? (joey starts to groan.) hey! hey! bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
(covering his ears and yelling) oh no! no! no! (he starts banging on the door.)
(whispering) monica!
she is sleeping.
i know, just quick-quick question, quick question. which one was deep impact and which one was armageddon?
deep impact was the one with robert duval, armageddon is what is going to happen to you if you wake me up.
sorry, i just…can not sleep. ooh! (turns on the light and monica groans.) where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? because every time i look at that cover I am like…(fake snores.)
it is in the living room where there is also a light! and no one will kick you in the shin.
what?! (monica kicks him in the shin.) ow! (he gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
(crossing her fingers and closing her eyes) please do not be a space ship. please do not be a space ship. (she turns on the light and looks around and finds that it is the smoke detector that is beeping.) oh thank god! (she moves a chair over and starts to investigate how to make the beeping turn off, in frustration she yanks the thing off of the wall. she sets it down and heads for bed, just as she gets there it beeps again. she opens the cover and removes the battery, but it still beeps.) how could you be beeping?! i just disconnected you! i took out your battery! how can…
do not interrupt me!!
rachel!! monica!!
come on!
i can not believe this!!
all right well, y’know…i guess we know what we have to do to get down.
(standing at the edge of the roof) yeah, i guess we do not have a choice. (screaming to the street) help us! please help us! we are stuck up on the roof and we can not get down!!!
ross. i was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (points it out.)
(to joey) i know, i was not finished. (joey motions him to finish.) (yelling at the street) but do not worry! we are going to go down the fire escape!!
shhhhhhhhh!!! (monica enters) I am sorry, i thought maybe I would make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
with a wok? (chandler’s holding a wok.) i thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
it got interesting! damn you oprah!
here, let me make the milk, I am up anyway.
hey, y’know what we can do? y’know, now that we are up? we can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. it would be fun!
okay that does sound like fun.
okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
the second sister dies?!
(pause) no. no, i-i was, i was talking about the book i was reading.
the second sister dies in archie and jughead double digest?
that is correct.
you want to go in the bedroom? it is a little more comfortable.
okay. (they start to head for the bedroom) oh wait! umm, did you send those contracts to milan?
no seriously, y’know the contracts i gave you, did you overnight them?
okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that i do not get.
y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? (he starts laughing.) tag! I am serious! this is not funny! those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
yes i did! and i put a little post-it on it that said, "must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then i put a little heart in the corner because i did not want to seem to bossy.
y’know what tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
no! come on its late, we are not going to go down to the office.
okay get your coat! (they get their coats and start to leave. rachel suddenly stops and sticks the hand up the back of her shirt.) oh! when did you unhook this? (her bra.) nice work!
all right, it will not go down any further. it is stuck.
ugh. well, we are just going to have to jump. (joey looks at him.) yeah. now, we are going to have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. so, when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! i have to do it?!
yeah! oh yeah, you will be fine! it-it will be uh, just like bungy jumping. y’know? but instead of bouncing back up you-you will not.
what if i smack my head on the concrete?
well, I am going to lie to you joey, it is a possibility.
(looks at the ground and at ross) i do not know ross! i-i tell you what, let us flip to see who does it, okay? you-you call it in the air, all right?
oh, all right. (joey flips the coin.) tails! (the coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) can you-can you see what it is?
no.
okay. well, you be careful.
what? no! no ross! no-no! stop! I am not jumping! okay, look i have an audition tomorrow and i can not go if i break my leg.
well I am jumping! i have a son! okay? he will not have a father if-if i die!
well all right so, it looks like we are even!
okay. so, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. (she points at each as she says it.) okay so, to get the beeping to stop all i have to do… (she picks up a shoe and proceeds to pummel the smoke detector. she then gets up and heads to bed, stops, quickly turns around, and is satisfied that the beeping has stopped.) well done, pheebs. (she resumes her trek to bed, but is stopped at the entrance to the hallway by the now steady and extremely loud tone emanating from the smoke detector.) (yelling.) what do you want from me?!!!!!!!
okay, here is your milk. what do you want to talk about? (she sees that chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)
(startled) what? what? what?
ohh! ohhhh! were you sleeping sweetie? I am sorry. here. (hands the mug of milk to him.)
oh how can you possibly know? look at this mess, tag! i mean, this is what I am talking about! you have to be organized! you have got newspapers! you have got magazines! you got—ohh! (finds a picture.) and who is this chippy? a little young for you tag, but whatever.
okay, very cute braces. anyway y’know what, the point is tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. (she goes into her office.)
in the afternoon. mr. zelner came into my office after lunch. he put them on my desk, and then i put a post-it on it (looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the post-it on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave tag) that said, "must go out today." so you just keep looking in there! all right?
puzzler. a bit of a puzzle. why do not you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
i do not know tag! how can your genitals make phone calls? okay? it is not a perfect world! just go please.
thank you. (he leaves and she proceeds to plant the folder in his bottom drawer. she then picks up the phone and holds it to her breasts.) hello? (hangs up the phone.) i still do not get it.
are you still awake?
yeah! you?
you do know that was me who just said that right? (he does not respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) hey. as long as we are both up…
(intrigued) yeah? (monica nods yes.) i hope you are not thinking about cleaning the living room.
man, I am starving! what the hell was i thinking at dinner?! "do you want soup or salad?" both! always order both!
(looking in the window behind them) y’know, y’know I am lookin’ and i do not think anyone’s home here. i say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
yeah? really? no one’s home?
i do not think so. hello? (knocks on the glass, which angers the big, large, angry dog behind the glass and causes them to jump to the other side of the landing.) when you get in there… (joey nods his disapproval.)
okay, this is where you and i part ways. (she drops the blanket into the chute.) noisy bitch!
what?! what are you doing?!
do you know what just happened?
yeah. we-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
no. we were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
nooo! no, that is not true. no, best time ever! yeah, you rocked me world! (she turns out the light to go back to sleep.)
(turning the light back on) monica?
what?!
i was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. so please wake up so we can do it right!
okay. okay, I am ready. come on big fella!
okay.
give me the good stuff.
yeah! (monica falls asleep) no! no! no! do not fall asleep! okay, i am going to make you some coffee. (monica does not move as he gets out of bed and as he is heading for the door.) and i probably will not spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
okay, I am up! I am up!
hi! i got you some coffee. to, uh… (she looks for a place to set it on his messy desk and he clears a spot for her to set it down.) …fair enough. so! do you got anything for me?
oh my god! did you check your entire desk! did you check all the drawers!
well yeah, i wish that you would. (he opens the top drawer.) well, no it is not in there! (closes it.) how about that drawer? (she points to the bottom one and he opens it. she does not see the folder she planted and bends over to check.)
(thinks) y’know, i do not-i do not know. let me, let me check. (as she heads for her office, she stops glances over her should at tag, looks into her office, and finds the folder on her desk.)
can i see you in my office for a minute?
you put these on my desk!
oh really? so you are saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?! (i think dogbert should have a line here.)
(pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) i am so hot for you right now.
oh my god! how did you get back here?!
(scared) fire alarm? (she opens the door to reveal a fireman holding the blanket with the smoke detector.) oh! hi, officer—fireman, can-can i help you?
that is not mine.
how do you know?
okay do you—okay, do you have a search warrant? because the last time i checked this was still america!
fine! (she takes the blanket.) but please god; tell me how to stop them from going off!
there is a reset button?! ugh, thank you! thank you! (he exits and she goes to shut it off.) there is a reset button! my god! why did not i see that! (she takes off the plastic cover and looks for the button.) reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? (finds it.) oh here it is! (picks it up off of the floor.) oh! (she presses it hard, but of course it would help if the button was still attached to the detector. in frustration she presses it so hard it causes pain in her thumb.) ohh, god!
okay, do-do you have a good grip?
yeah!
okay, I am going to start climb down you now.
all right! just hurry up!
okay. now-now-now should i climb down your front so we are face to face or-or should i climb down your back so we are-we are butt to face.
i think face to face.
i would say that.
face to face, yeah!
okay, here i go.
all right.
(grunting) oh my… how much do you weigh ross?!
i prefer not to answer that right now, I am still carrying a little holiday weight.
y’know, when we talked about face to face, i do not think we thought it all the way through.
so what do you want me to do?
well, just shimmy down me and drop!
hi.
hi.
(looking down) m-maybe i should hang and you can climb down me.
(angrily) yeah? maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
it is still looks pretty far!
it is not that far! just drop!
do not rush me!!
ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I am not wearing any underwear!
oww!! my ankle! i really hurt my ankle! i think i twisted it when i—ooh, a quarter!
that really was some of your best work.
hm-hmm, i told you! (looks at the clock) i can not believe that I have only got two hours before i call in sick for work.
i have to be up in seven minutes.
well, you are not going to believe this, but if you have seven minutes…
really?!
do you want to?
okay! you get the vacuum cleaner and I will get the furniture polish!
dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
yes please.
he is a he?
...could not enjoy a cup of noodles after that. i mean, is that ridiculous? can you believe she actually thought that?
um... yeah. well, i mean, when i first met you, y'know, i thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
you did?
yeah, but then you spent phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then i figured maybe not.
huh. did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
i did.
yeah, i think so, yeah.
not me.
nono, me neither. although, uh, y'know, back in college, susan sallidor did.
you are kidding! did you tell her i was not?
no. no, it is just because, uh, i kind of wanted to go out with her too, so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman... who also liked her, so...
well, this is fascinating. so, uh, what is it about me?
i dunno, because you are smart, you are funny...
ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
what is it?!
okay, i-i d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
oh, oh, a quality, good, because i was worried you guys were going to be vague about this.
hello? hello? oh! rachel, it is paolo calling from rome.
oh my god! calling from rome! (takes phone) bon giorno, caro mio.
(to joey) so he is calling from rome. i could do that. just got to go to rome.
monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? talking to rome. (showing off to phoebe and chandler) I am talking to rome.
hey dad, what is up? (listens) oh god. ross, it is nana.
so, uh, how is she doing?
how-how are you, mom?
what?
nothing.
she is unbelievable, our mother is...
okay, relax, relax. we are going to be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
oh god!
the fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
oh! ...yeah, they were gross. oh, you know what i loved? her sweet 'n' los. how she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
she looks so small.
i know.
well, at least she is with pop-pop and aunt phyllis now.
g'bye, nana. (she kisses her on the forehead.)
bye, nana.
ross!
y'know how-how the nurse said that-that nana had passed? well, she is not, quite..
she is not- past, she is present, she is back.
i, uh, I will go see. (he goes in)
now she is passed.
i just have to know, okay. is it my hair?
(exasperated) yes, chandler, that is exactly what it is. it is your hair.
yeah, you have homosexual hair.
so, um, did she...
twice.
twice?
oh, that sucks!
you guys okay?
i dunno, it is weird. i mean, i know she is gone, but i just do not feel, uh...
maybe that is because she is not really gone.
nono, she is gone.
we checked. a lot.
hm, i mean maybe no-one ever really goes. ever since my mom died, every now and then, i get the feeling that she is like right here, y'know? (she circles her hand around her right shoulder. chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) oh! and debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- i always get this really strong debbie vibe whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...i miss her.
aw. hey, pheebs, want this? (gives her a pencil)
thanks!
sure. i just sharpened her this morning.
now, see, i do not believe any of that. i think once you are dead, you are dead! you are gone! you are worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...so chandler looks gay, huh?
y'know, i dunno who this is, but it is not debbie. (hands back the pencil)
i thought it was going to be a closed casket.
(sarcastic) i do not see why not.
here is my retainer!
dad!
you what?
define fun.
...and then we throw your body in the water... gee, that does sound fun.
that is probably what they will say.
hey, gorgeous.
no, nono, do not- do not worry about it. believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
so, uh... what do you think it is about me?
...quality, right, great.
lowell? financial services' lowell, that is who you saw me with?
well, yeah... 's'no brian in payroll.
no! uh, i d'know! the point is, if you were going to set me up with someone, I would like to think you would set me up with someone like him.
excuse me? you do not think i could get a brian? because i could get a brian. believe you me. ...I am really not.
(holding a dress out from inside the closet) this one?
i have shown you everything we have. unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
oh! a fine choice. I am coming out. (starts to climb over the furniture)
okay. um, how about these? (holds out a pair)
and where she is going everyone else'll be dressier?
(forages around) okay, i have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. i can show you something in a silver that may work.
no! nonono, wait a sec. i may have something in the back.
oh my god..
yeah, just... just nana stuff.
(entering) how we doing, you guys ready?
mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. did you know my ears are not my best feature?
some days it is all i can think about.
(entering) hi, sorry I am late, i could not find my bearings.
oh, you-you mean your earrings?
what did i say?
(sticking her foot out) hm-m.
are these the shoes?
yes. paolo sent them from italy.
what, we-uh- we do not have shoes here, or...?
(entering with chandler) morning. we ready to go?
well, do not we look nice all dressed up?...it is stuff like that, is not it?
it was a really beautiful service.
what?
nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent mussberger.
check it out, giants-cowboys. (he has a pocket tv)
you are watching a football game at a funeral?
no, it is the pre-game. I am going to watch it at the reception.
you are a frightening, frightening man.
oh no! my new paolo shoes!
oh, i hope they are not ruined.
god, what a great day. ...what? weather-wise!
i know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though nana's gone there is, there is something almost, uh- i dunno, almost life-aff- (not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)
I am fine. just-just... having my worst fear realised...
okay, do not worry, I am just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
what, what is it?
you missed a belt loop.
oh! no-n-
okay, it is in spasm.
oh, no-
hi, I am chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is.
hey, look who is up! how do you feel?
i feel great. i feel- great, i fleel great.
wow, those pills really worked, huh?
not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...i love you guys. you guys are the greatest. i love my sister (kisses monica), i love pheebs... (hugs her)
ooh! that is so nice...
...chandler!
hey.
(hugs him) and listen, man, if you want to be gay, be gay. does not matter to me.
rachel. rachel rachel. (sits down beside her) i love you the most.
(humouring him) oh, well you know who i love the most?
no.
you!
oh.. you do not get it! (passes out and slumps across her)
(hides the tv, but he still has an earphone) just a, uh... hearing disability.
seventeen-fourteen giants... three minutes to go in the third.
(still trapped under ross) pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
that sounds like nana.
...i can imagine.
that is a wonder. so tell me something, mom. if you had to do it all over again, i mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
how she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
do you think things would have been better if you would just told her the truth?
huh.
oh, i think so.
thank you. they are yours.
hey, who is this little naked guy?
that little naked guy would be me.
aww, look at the little thing.
yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. can we be grown-ups now?
who are those people?
got me.
oh, that is nana, right there in the middle. (reads the back) 'me and the gang at java joe's'.
wow, monica, you look just like your grandmother. how old was she there?
let us see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
looks like a fun gang. (they all look at each other and smile)
ooh, look-look-look-look-look! i got monica naked!
(looking) nono, that would be me again. I am, uh, just trying something.
hey, lowell.
so how is it going there in financial services?
good, good. listen, heh, i dunno what shelley told you about me, but, uh... I am not.
really.
so- you can tell?
so you do not think i have a, a quality?
he is?
out of my league. i could get a brian. (brian enters behind him) if i wanted to get a brian, i could get a brian. (sees him) hey, brian.
oh monica that was the best thanksgiving dinner ever! i think you killed us.
i could not possibly eat another bite.
i need something sweet.
does anyone want to watch tv?
monica your remote does not work.
phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
oh. aw, forget it.
yeah, you know what we should all do? we should play that game where everyone says one thing that they are thankful for.
ooh-ooh, i! i am thankful for this beautiful fall we have been having.
that is very nice.
that is sweet, joey.
yeah, the other day i was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. oh! which reminds me, I am also thankful for thongs. (note: actually, i think every guy is thankful for thongs. that and spandex. j )
i mean, it is not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. i mean, it is amazing how much they can do with so little material! and the way they play with your mind! is it there? is it not there?
are you aware that you are still talking?
is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
huh, i do not know what to pick. am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? hmm.
wow! see, and i did not think you would be able to come up with anything.
I am sorry. it is just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever.
no-no-no! i am the king of bad thanksgivings. you can not just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
oh, you are not going to tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
oh god, no.
oh, come on! i want to hear it! it would not be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out!
it is a tradition, like the parade. if the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
you are right. yours is worse. you are the king of bad thanksgivings.
i do not know about that. I have got one that is worse.
really? worse than, "more turkey mr. chandler?"
oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? yes, mine's worse!
in this life, phoebe.
oh, this life! oh okay no, chandler's is worse.
man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! i do not have any past life memories.
of course you do not sweetie. you are brand new.
i know monica's worst thanksgiving.
oh, let us not tell this story.
oh no, i know! i know! it is the one where joey got monica's turkey stuck on his head!
what?! joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
hey, it is not like it sounds.
it is exactly like it sounds.
(muffled) hello?
(surprised) hello?
phoebe?
joey? what is going on?
look. (he walks out of the bathroom with his head stuck in a huge turkey.)
oh my god!
i know! it is stuck!!!
(walks him to the kitchen) easy. step. how did it get on?
i put it on to scare chandler!
oh my god! monica's going to totally freak out!
well then help me get it off! plus, it smells really bad in here.
well, of course it smells really bad. you have your head up a dead animal.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey, did you get the turkey basted—oh my god! oh my god! (she sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) who is that?
it is joey.
what-what are you doing? is this supposed to be funny?
no, it is not supposed to be funny, it is supposed to be scary.
well, get it off now!
i can not! it-it is stuck!
well, i do not care! that-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they are not going to eat it off your head!
all right, hold on! okay, let us just all think.
okay, i got it. phoebe? all right, you pull. I am going to spread the legs as wide as i can. (joey starts giggling.) joey? now is not the time!
sorry! sorry.
okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
arghhhhhh!! (joey turns around to taunt him, but chandler is in the doorway and joey is facing the kitchen.)
(pointing) it worked! i scared ya, i knew it! ha-ha!
I am over here big guy.
(turning all the way around, and still not facing chandler) yeah, you are! (starts dancing.) i scared you!
(laughing) you did look like an idiot.
hey, i was not the only one who looked like an idiot. all right? remember when ross tried to say, "butternut squash?" and it came out, "squatternut buash?"
yeah that is the same.
that is it. that is my worse thanksgiving.
oh wait! that can not be the one rachel's talking about. she did not even know that happened. so which one was it?
umm, i-i really do not want to tell this story.
oh, come on monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what thanksgiving is all about. y'know, for me anyway. and of course, the indians.
look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
I will get it! (she runs in, and she is her old fat self like the one with the prom video. not only that, she is out of breath after running a short distance. she goes over and opens the door to reveal rachel with her old nose.) happy thanksgiving!
(entering) hey!
uh, everyone, this is chandler! my roommate and lead singer of our band!
oh, this is monica.
(seeing her) okay.
oh, mom. mom. chandler hates thanksgiving and does not eat any thanksgiving food.
well, as long as the pilgrims did not eat it, I am in.
so uh, rach? does it, does it feel weird around here now? y'know since I have been away at college.
well, that is cool. so did… (she walks away from him and he shuts up.)
umm, I am sorry judy, i could not find that bowl that you and jack were looking for.
(in a high pitched voice) monica!
oh yeah, it was great. you should be a chef.
so I am thinking about asking rachel out tonight. y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
emotional knapsack?
yeah.
right on! oh! uh, but, do not take to long okay? because uh, we are going to test out our fake id's tonight, right clifford alverez.
listen, roland chang, if things go well, I am going to be out with her all night.
dude, do not do that too me!
all right, it is cool you can stay here. my parents will not mind.
no, it is not that, i just do not want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
hey!
i called you fat?! i do not even remember that!
well, i do.
i am so sorry. i really am. i was an idiot back then. i rushed the stage at a wham concert for crying out loud!
oh, i can not believe you called her fat.
i can not believe you let george michael slap you.
i am really sorry. that is so terrible. i am so, so sorry.
actually, y'know that is not the thanksgiving i was talking about.
yes, it was!
no, it was not. it was actually the…
(interrupting her) okay, now thanksgiving's over, let us get ready for christmas. who wants to go get a christmas tree?!
oh, no, i have the cutest christmas story!
we want to hear monica's thanksgiving story!
fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
oh, yeah, i had too. there was never any parking by the psychology building.
oh hi!
no, god! please, let me! (runs out.)
hey!
hey. (to his parents) happy thanksgiving!
yeah, we were just talking about that. i can not believe how stupid we used to look. (they both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
so uh, where is monica?
hi, chandler.
oh my god!
what-what is the matter? is there, is there something on my dress? (she turns around making sure he gets a good look.)
you just, you look so different! terrific! that dress! that body!
dude!
sorry!
oh mom! okay, umm, her name is carol. and she is really pretty. and smart. and uh, she is-she is on the lacrosse team and the golf team. can you believe it? she plays for both teams!
so chandler, i guess I will see you at dinner.
sorry.
(entering) oh-ho, my god! that was so awesome! you totally got him back for calling you fat! he was just drooling all over you. that must have felt so great!
well it did not!
what?!
yeah, i mean yeah, i look great. yeah, i feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! blah, blah, blah! y'know i still do not feel like i got him back, y'know? i just want to humiliate him. i want to, i want him to be like naked and then I am going to point at him and laugh!
okay, that we may be able to do.
how?
well guys tend to get naked before they are going to have sex.
what?! i mean, i did not work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that i can give my flower to someone like him!
okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's going to ever take it. then, second of all you are not actually going to have sex with him! you are just going to make him think that you are.
yeah.
yeah.
and when he is naked i can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
then, you will definitely get him back!
okay, so how do i make him think i want to have sex with him?
okay, oh, here is what you do. just act like everything around you turns you on.
what do you mean?
well, like anything can be sexy. like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! (she grabs it and starts rubbing it on her cheek.) ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! and-and if i feel a little hot, i can just dab myself with it. or i can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while i talk to him.
(excited) i can do that!
yeah? okay! good, good, because he is coming. he is coming. (to chandler) hey, what is up? (she leaves and closes the door behind her.)
monica, i was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
umm, I would love too! (she goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) ooh, i love macaroni and cheese. i love-i love the way this box feels against my cheek.
okay.
boy, i love carrots! oh! (she picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) sometimes i like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while i talk to you. (she is rubbing her hip with the carrots.) umm, and-and-and y'know if i get really hot umm, i-i like to pick up this knife (she picks up a knife without putting the box down. she is holding the box between her cheek and shoulder) and-and umm, i-i put the cold steal against umm, (pause) my body. (she does not have any exposed skin within reach of the knife, so while holding the carrots in one hand and the box between her face and shoulder, she rubs the knife on her stomach.)
are you all right?
oh yeah, of course. I am fine it is just that—(she drops the box and in a reflex action tries to catch it with her arm, the knife slips out and slowly flips through the air and comes point first down into chandler's shoe.)
can you please not do that feet first? you know where his injury is! severed toe, you just said it!
oh yes! i have it right here, on ice! (she takes a bag of ice out of her purse and hands it to the doctor.)
what?! what is it?
what?
you brought a carrot?!
god, I am sorry! I will go back and get it!
without my toe?! i need my toe!
wait, no-no-no, i can go really fast! dad, give me the keys to your porsche!
that is why i lost my toe?! because i called you fat?!
i did not mean to cut it off. it was an accident.
that is why for an entire year people called me sir limps-a-lot?!
I am sorry! it was not your whole toe!
yeah, well, i miss the tip! it is the best part. it has the nail. (he storms out.)
chandler! (follows him out.)
(to joey) sir limps-a-lot, i came up with that.
you are a dork.
i can not believe this.
chandler, i said i was sorry.
yeah, well, sorry does not bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! i hate this stupid day! and everything about it! I will see you later.
oh wait, chandler, come here is there anything i can do? anything?
yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (he goes into his apartment.)
oh-oh, I am a duck! i go, "quack, quack!" I am happy all the time!
nice try.
wait, wait, wait! (she puts a shriner's hat on the turkey.)
look, monica…
look! (she puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
this is not going to work.
i bet this will work! (she starts dancing and chandler cracks up.)
you are so great! i love you!
what?
nothing! i said, i said "you are so great" and then i just, i just stopped talking!
you said you loved me! i can not believe this!
no i did not!
yes, you did!
no i did not!
you love me!
no i do not! stop it! stop it! stop it! stop it!
what you guys do not understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
yeah, right!.......y'serious?
oh, yeah!
everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
absolutely.
yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it is like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out.
yeah, and-and it is not that we do not like the comedian, it is that-that... that is not why we bought the ticket.
the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we are in the car, we are fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
yeah, well, word of advice: bring back the comedian. otherwise next time you are going to find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
(pause)....are we still talking about sex?
no, it is good, it is good, it is just that- mm- does not she seem a little angry?
does she.
marsha, these are cave people. okay? they have issues like 'gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.' see?
(trying to ignore her) no. no.
okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) how about I will, uh, catch up with you in the ice age.
i.
you look great. i, uh... i hate that.
ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... so what is new? still, uh...
well... you never know. how is, um.. how is the family?
why- why are you here, carol?
pregnant?!
oh, i think this is the episode of three's company where there is some kind of misunderstanding.
..then I have already seen this one! (turns off the tv.)
(taking a drink from joey) are you through with that?
yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
whose little ball of paper is this?!
oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i did not need it, so i balled it up and... (sees that monica is glaring at him) ...now i wish i was dead.
she is already fluffed that pillow... monica, you know, you have already fluffed that- (monica glares at her.) -but, it is fine!
look , I am sorry, guys, i just do not want to give them any more ammunition than they already have.
yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
monica- hi! um, monica, you are scaring me. i mean, you are like, you are like all chaotic and twirly. and not-not in a good way.
yeah, calm down. you do not see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
that is because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. y'see, he is the prince. apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born.
(looking out the window) ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
what?
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster!
has anybody seen my engagement ring?
yeah, it is beautiful.
oh god, oh god, oh god oh god oh god oh god.... (starts to look under the couch cushions.)
no, look, do not touch that!
oh, like i was not dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'hi barry! remember me? I am the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' oh god and now I am going to have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
easy rach, we will find it. (to all) will not we!
alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
doy! probably right before she lost it!
you do not get a lot of 'doy' these days...
i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with...
...dinah?
(looks at the lasagne and realizes something) ohhhhh, do not be mad...
you did not.
oh, i am sorry...
i gave you one job! (starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
now, monica, you know that is not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
(puts down the lasagne) i just... can not do it.
boys? we are going in.
(standing outside the door).....hi.
wow. that is not a happy hi.
carol's pregnant.
(while everyone else is stunned) ooh! i found it!
w-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
yeah. do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now. (he enters.)
kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon?
well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved, but if I am not comfortable with it, i do not have to be involved.. basically it is entirely up to me.
she is so great! i miss her.
what does she mean by 'involved'?
i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
so what are you going to do?
i have no idea. no matter what i do, though, I am still going to be a father.
.....well, this is still ruined, right?
curry.
i- i think they are great! i, i really do.
aw, mom...
I am sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
no mom, i do not have a restaurant, i work in a restaurant.
ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
yeah. (they go to the kitchen.)
i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? because i think it might take some of the heat off me.
what is that supposed to mean?
no it is not.
(trying desperately to change the subject) so, ross, what is going on with you? any stories? (digs her elbow into his hand.) no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
(pulls his hand away) okay! okay. (to his parents) look, i, uh- i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me, and, so, well, here is the deal. carol's a lesbian. she is living with a woman named susan. she is pregnant with my child, and she and susan are going to raise the baby.
your folks are really that bad, huh?
well, y'know, these people are pros. they know what they are doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
boy, i know they say you can not change your parents,... boy, if you could- (to ross) -I would want yours.
must pee. (goes to pee.)
y'know, it is even worse when you are twins.
you are twins?
yeah. we do not speak. she is like this high-powered, driven career type.
what does she do?
she is a waitress.
all right, you guys, i kind of got to clean up now. (they all start to leave.)
chandler, you are an only child, right? you do not have any of this.
well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
the lights, please..
...how long was i in there?
I am just cleaning up.
d'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
uh.. okay, sure! thanks! (she hands him the broom and sits down.)
anyway.. um.. (starts to sweep.) so, you- uh- you nervous about barry tomorrow?
oh.. a little..
mm-hmm..
a lot.
mm.
so, got any advice? y'know, as someone who is recently been- dumped?
well, you may want to steer clear of the word 'dumped'. chances are he is going to be this, this broken she will of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, i know it will be hard. or, y'know, uh, hey!, I will go down there, and I will give barry back his ring, and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn...
oh, you have got carol tomorrow.. when did it get so complicated?
got me.
remember when we were in high school together?
yeah.
i mean, did not you think you were just going to meet somone, fall in love- and that would be it? (ross gazes at her.) ..ross?
yes, yes!
oh! man, i never thought I would be here.. (she leans back onto his hand.)
me either... (he pulls up a stool so that he does not have to move his hand.)
(entering) sorry I am late, i was stuck at work. there was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
how could i forget?
(they shake hands) hello, susan. (to carol) good shake. good shake. so, uh, we are just waiting for...?
..dr. oberman. okay. and is he-
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
okay, that is great. (susan gives her drink to carol.) no, I am- oh. 
(picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) quack, quack..
barry?
(hesitates) are you sure?
I am- uh- I am okay... you look great!
i dumped him.
so, um- so how is this, uh, how is this going to work? y'know, with us? y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
well, uh, uh, i do not know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
marlon?!
...as in mouse?
still, you- you say minnie, you hear mouse. um, how about, um.. how about julia?
's'funny, um, uh, we agreed we would spend the rest of our lives together. things change, roll with the punches. i believe julia's on the table..?
oh, not much. i-i got a job.
why are- why are you so tanned?
oh no. you went on our honeymoon alone?
mindy?! my maid of honour, mindy?!
oh! well, um.. (grabs his forehand) you have got plugs!
and you have got lenses! but you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
okay..
wow.
what?
anyway, um, (gets the ring out of her purse.) i guess this belongs to you. and thank you for giving it to me.
helen geller? i do not think so.
thank you!
what, it is going to be helen willick?
well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
oh, 's'funny, really? um, i do not remember you making any sperm.
no no no, she gets a credit, hey, I am in there too.
of course not, I am... suggesting geller-willick-bunch.
my way?! you-you think this is my way? believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? uh, um, this is too hard. I am not, i can not do-
you- uh- y'know what, I am going to go. i do not- i do not think i can be involved in this particular thing right now.
oh my god.
well? is not that amazing?
what are we supposed to be seeing here?
i dunno, but.. i think it is about to attack the enterprise.
you know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kind of looks like an old potato.
then do not do that, alright?
okay!
(walks over to where monica is standing)monica. whaddya think?
(welling up) mm-hmm.
wh- are you welling up?
no.
you are, you are welling up.
am not!
you are going to be an aunt.
(pushes him and starts to cry) oh shut up!
(on phone) hi, mindy. hi, it-it is rachel. yeah, I am fine. i-i saw barry today. oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. no, no, it is okay. i hope you two are very happy, i really do. oh, oh, and mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- i just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (slams the phone down.) (to everyone) okay, i know it was a cheap shot, but i feel so much better now.
y'know, i can not believe I am getting my nails done!  and you said it was going to be fun! (pause) which it kind of is.  also, you said there would be other guys here. there are no other guys here!
chandler, there is a guy right over there. (points to the counter)
that is a mailman! that is our mailman! (waves to the mailman) (sarcastic) hi. how are ya?
chandler, do not worry! this does not make you any less of a guy! (chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) that does! (chandler stops blowing.) what am i sitting on? (she looks and finds a huge nail.) i hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
hmm.
joey let me ask you a question. what does this light switch do?
ohh, nothing.
did not it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
i know what it did! nothing.
they would not have put it there if it did not do something! how can you not care?
like this. (shrugs)
well, here is another question for ya. uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
sure! it flushes it.
okay, good. now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
(entering, with janice in tow) hello!
hey! (sees janice.) ah!! (janice screams in surprise.)
guess who we ran into today?!
janice?!
is not this amazing?
how have you been?
ohhh, wow.
and there it is.
okay. bye.
bye.
bye.
b-bye!
bye. (finally closes the door on her.) (after it is closed) i can not stand the woman! (phoebe is shocked, joey is relieved.)
what?! i thought you were crazy about her!
yeah, i know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? like her voice, her laugh, her personality—well, they are all back! y’know? and she is picked up like nine new ones!
so what are you doing bringing her here?! there is people here!
do not worry about it. I am taking care of it tonight. (chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
you are not. you have never been able to break up with her.
(standing in the door of the fridge) well, i do not have to break up with her this time. we are not involved! I am going to do a pre-emptive strike! I am going to end it with her before it starts. my ass is like frozen! (closes the fridge.)
yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (they all look around and then back at joey.) I am tellin’ ya!
no, it is really not that bad. i mean, i-i for one, feel perfectly safe.
help! help!! help! help!!
oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (imitating himself) help! help!
oh, liam. so uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should i call it (in an english accent) football?
what is ah, what is so funny about that?
well, we did not have freedom here until 1776, either so…
cheers!
yes, i-i know that you do, but i think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing old man river.
(laughs) okay, we have to talk. I am just getting out of a very serious relationship…
right! i just think that this is happening too soon.
i hear ya. (pause) but! unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
no! no! not, paris.
okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (thinks) yemen. that is right, yes, I am being transferred to yemen!
i do not know exactly.
but i do know that it is some time tomorrow.
done?
yep!
(entering, with joey) hey!
hey! what is up?
this switch thing has been driving me crazy. so i turned it off and checked every outlet. now, four of them do not work. which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. so, i plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
(to rachel) i bet i stopped listening before you did.
y’know, you-you also could have used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
yeah, well, I am using noise. okay. all right! so, is everybody ready? here we go. (she flips on the switch and a hum starts.) i hear something! i hear something! where is it? (they all start looking until rachel realises it is joey.)
it is coming from joey!
oh my god, that is so freaky! turn him off!!
ooh, hey, could we put on the news? i think it might be raining.
oh, just hold on a second. I am watching this rugby thing on espn. i do not know what the big deal is. I am man enough to play this sport.
dude, you are not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
(shocked) hey!
(whispering to ross) janice.
y’know uh, you did not really have to help me pack.
well, i-i thought i did but, i-i guess i did not!
hey-hey, what is going on?
oh, I am packing. y’know I am-I am packing ‘because I am moving to yemen tomorrow.
thanks for telling me!
I am only going to pretend I am moving to yemen, it is the only way i can get rid off her.
ohhhh, good one! and yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
yeah, i know, i do that ‘because it makes me look taller.
(to janice) okay. (to joey) joey, trade lives with me!
nope. (to ross) man look at this! ross, i can not believe you said you would play rugby. i mean look how brutal this is!
hey, i can handle it! all right?
please, ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
that is ‘because-‘because you are mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
(pointing to the tv) okay, ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. that is called a scrum, okay? it is kind of like a huddle.
and is a hum, kind of like a scruddle?
ross! (laughs) they are going to kill you!
well, why are you doing this anyway?
well, you should have seen the guy that she used to go out with. i mean, he is like joe rugby.
you are kidding! and he plays rugby?! that is so funny. (realises) ohh! i see how you did that. all right.
anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. so I am going to show her how tough i really am!
(starts laughing, ross stares at her) I am sorry. I am sorry. you are right, you are a tough guy. you are the toughest palaeontologist i know.
all right, come on look, ross can take care of himself! it is not like he is…chandler!
(from his bedroom) thanks!
look, do not worry about me. okay? I will just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I will uh, I will be that guy right out of the circle. (he points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)
oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.
ross-ross-ross-ross! stay away from that guy (points), and that guy (points). and that one—dude! they are all huge!
they do not look any bigger than me!
well, maybe that is because you are closer to you. so you look bigger to you from where you are.
all right.
(to the player) hi.
whoa! (the player leaves and to joey) i kind of liked it.
okay, i know what i have to do. I have got to go red ross. (joey and phoebe do not know what he is talking about.) y’know, red ross!
i totally do not know what you are talking about.
come on! the time we were all waiting in line for dances with wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and i just lost it?! screamed at him! turned all red! red ross!!
no.
you will see.
joey!!!!!!
you…are…not going to believe it! joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
he asked you out?!
no. but i was showing him some cufflinks and i felt his pulse.
saucy!
(refers to the table) what are these?
electrical plans for the building.
okay, okay, okay should i be scared?
i know that switch does something, okay? so-so i went down to city hall and got these. all i had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
wow! if only more people knew.
y’know you, really did not have to take me to the airport.
well, we are really not that close. (pause) okay, so i guess this is uh, good-bye then.
okay. then i guess it is just, wait here then. (hands her the sign that says, wait here.") (to the ticket agent) hi. i need one fake ticket to yemen.
oh no-no-no, no. no, no, no, i just, i just need a pretend ticket.
what would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
no. all right, y’know what, she is (points to janice) going to think that I am handing you a credit card, but what I am really going to do is hand you a library card.
(to the ticket agent) american express?
no offence but, y’know sometimes it is hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…
did you see me? i was pretty good, huh? that is one fun game!
(to emily) hey, could you do me a favour? could you just grab me a bottle of water?
thanks. (when she is gone he collapses into joey.) i-i think I am dying. i really do.
oh, poor baby.
(to phoebe) tell my son that i love him. (emily returns with the water.) excellent! well, okay, i got to have some more fun!
(whines "no.") that is not true!
she is right! you have to stop!
what? no! no, I am not stopping. I am red ross!
dude, if you go back out there, you are going to be dead ross!
i do not care! i am not quitting! i insist on finishing this game!
no, god no! that is no place for a woman. those guys will grab anything.
i like that.
huh?
all right, bad ankle, got it!
yeah? i can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! okay!
but-but, liam’s on my team.
I am going to go get him! okay, i am going back in! (squeals like a madman.)
the red ross! okay.
hey!
hi!
(noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that were not there originally.) what-what are-what are these?
oh, just some pictures i made and hung up. i thought they would brighten up the place. they do do not you think?
no-no-no, no!
i know that there is no hole there, i just really liked that picture.
oh my god! look at this!
okay, but there is a wire back there! i mean that switch is connected to something!
i do not care! the wires have come loose in your head!
i just thought that if i could follow the wire i could find out what it did.
and did you?!
no. it disappears back there behind that baseboard. for a minute there, i thought it went downstairs.
but it did not. say hello to mrs. chatracus.
oh my god.
hello, mrs. chatracus.
now, are you sure you do not want to go see a doctor?
oh no! that-that will just bring me down! this was great! i mean i-i-i was great! this is a great day! y’know what? I am buying everyone coffee. all right? if someone would just grab my wallet, it is in my pocket.
yeah, sure.
no, not you. (emily gets it.)
uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I am going to go get some ice.
ooh, ice! i am so in the mood for ice! (they go and get the coffee and the ice leaving ross and emily alone.)
oh, i kind of was, was not i?
i made a man twice my size cry. i mean, i have not done that since i was four and i washed my dad’s porsche with rocks.
please! are you kidding? i-i hurt three huge men, i gave a guy a bloody nose—i mean i-I am not proud of it but, i really am. and it is all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
no, no, I am serious. thank you.
it is worth the pain. (she goes to hug him again.) y’know what, you know what? it is not.
well, i-i guess i got to go.
well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
okay, good-bye. good-bye.
no!
janice! there you are! there you are! i had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after i got on the plane!
well, i then guess I am going to yemen! I am going to yemen! (to this old woman also going to yemen.) when we get to yemen, can i stay with you?
all right. the super could not figure out what it did. a $200 an hour electrician could not figure out what it did. I have had seven pretty serious shocks. i officially give up.
thank god.
i guess joey was right, it does nothing.
see? I am doing it. i am totally doing it. (suddenly it stops working.) i lost it.
hi!
hey!
hey!
so, I am in my apartment doing the soap opera digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. (she hands the magazine to joey.)
(reading) three down, days of our lives star blank tribbiani. that is me!! I am blank!!
how cool is this?! we know three down! I am touching three down! (she has her hand on his shoulder.)
yeah you are baby.
three down knows I am married, what is three down doing?
so did they call you to tell you your name’s going to be in this?
no. they really like me over there. they want to do a big profile on me, but i said no.
why did you say no?
remember what happened the last time i did an interview for them? i said i write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. so who knows what i might say this time.
if only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (joey nods his agreement.)
oh, come on joey! you will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! and you deserve that! and if you do the interview you can mention, oh i do not know, gal pal rachel green?
is that gal pal spelled l-of-s-e-r?
okay, do not listen to him. please?
fine! all right, I will do it. but hey! you guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if i y’know, start to say something stupid.
just then or-or all the time, ‘because we-we have jobs y’know.
come on! we will be there for you the whole time! just remember gal pal rachel green. (excited) ha-ha! I am going to be in soap opera digest! and not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. (looks at joey.) seriously, proud of you.
yeah.
oh, not at all. happy to do it.
(to chandler) you think we are being obvious?
no, we are just four people with neck problems. you talk like this. (out of the sides of their mouths.)
(laughs) actually, i did not know the magazine was paying for it. would not have mattered, I am doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
and I will have all the muffins.
(entering) hey!
shhh! we are not talking.
oh. finally! oh. (sits back in relief.)
(he goes into a song and dance number)
oh, you said it mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) aw! there is got to be a better way!
(finishing installing the milk master 2000) wow, it is easy. (starts to poor the milk) now, i can have milk everyday.
yeah, i guess it is. and so… I am going to get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, colored lights on the side of it) and I am going to go to blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. but when i return, 200 years from now, you will be long gone. but i will not have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) so you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because adrienne… baby…I am going to want to meet her.
shh, ok, here i come, here i come. see I am comin' to fix the copier, i can not get to the copier, I am thinkin' what do i do, what do i do…so i just watch  them have sex. and then i say, wait, here is my line, (joey from tv) you know that is bad for the paper tray.
nice work my friend.
thank you. wait-wait-wait-wait, you see me again. hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. there i am, there i am, there i am, there i am, there i am…
well, there are so many things, it is hard to pick just one.
I am going to get some coffee, anyone want anything?
oh yeah, I would actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
uh, double latte, extra foam.
and a bagel with only…
(interrupting him) i was just being polite!
(drinking a beer) look at this clown! just because he is got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (yelling) get out of the way jackass! (to rachel) who names their boat coast guard anyway?
that is the coast guard.
what are they doing out here? the coast’s all the way over there. (points to the coast.)
(entering) hey!
hey! check it out! this is unbelievable! joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
(to chandler) dude! what are yo—you trying to kill me?!
well, i see you have had a very productive day. do not you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
(popping up behind joey wearing an indian headdress) come on, it is fun!
all right! (he joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) is not this a woman's hat?
dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.
i think you are right.
all right, ready?
one.
two.
that is kind of nice.
yeah, that is kind of a relief.
yeah.
you want to see if we still have it?
yeah.
free porn!!!
yeah!!
we have free porn here!!!
in my spare time i uh, read to the blind. and I am also a mento for the kids.(the gang shake their heads.) y’know a mento, a role model. (chandler bites his fist to keep from talking.)
right.
matter of fact, i do.
uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
wow! you realize that we have been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
are you serious?!
yeah. i realized it about a half-hour ago but i did not want to say anything because i did not want to jinx it.
wow! we are pretty good at this!
yeah!
hey! we totally forgot about lunch!
oh, i-i, i think that is the first time i ever missed a meal! (checks his pants.) yeah, my pants are a little loose!
what is wrong with you?
nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, have not been able to stand up since. but um, i do not think it is anything serious.
this sounds like a hernia. you have to—you-you—go to the doctor!
no way! ‘kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything it is going to be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (rolls over and shows chandler.) why did i have to start working out again? (looks at the weights he was using.) damn you 15s!
it is a trifle. it is got all of these layers. first there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which i made from scratch. [joey and ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef saut�ed with peas and onions, [joey and ross look like something is wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then i just put some whipped cream on top!
it tastes like feet!
i like it.
are you kidding?
what is not to like? custard? good. jam? good. meat? goooooood.
the fridge broke. i have to eat everything. cold cuts, ice cream, limes—hey, what was in that brown jar?
that is still in there?!
not anymore.
oh! yay! look! there is a piece that does not have floor on it!
stick to your side!
hey, come on now!
(pulls out a fork) all right, what are we having? (starts digging in.)
uhh, i do not believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.
I will take those to go. (to the interviewer) for the kids.
it was so stupid, i said some stuff in an interview that i should not have said. but believe me, that is not going to happen today.
well, i said that i… (the gang jumps up and interrupts him.)
you guys, this is shelley, she is interviewing me for soap opera digest, and shelley, this are my friends…
(interrupting him) hi! I am gal pal rachel green, and if you want the dirt, I am the one you come too. this might be joey’s baby (rubbing her stomach), who knows? I am just kidding—seriously, (leans into the cassette recorder shelley is using) gal pal rachel green.
(leaning into the recorder as well) who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
okay.
joey! you are doing great!
yeah, so far nothing stupid.
mento?
no thanks.
uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
(scoffs at him) yeah, that is going to get you into soap opera digest. well i…(leans into the microphone again)…i would just like to say that joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
umm, i…i just think you do not expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
umm, phoebe buffay.
oh okay, it is p as in phoebe, h as in hoebe, of as in oebe, e as in ebe, b as in bee-bee and e as in (in an australian accent) ‘ello there mate!
yeah, you too.
you too!
thanks.
bye. (they resume their previous positions.)
how come you have two?
well this one's for you.
get out.
no, i can not. no-no, listen, i, i know how much this means to you and i also know that this is about more than just jewelry, (puts bracelet on joey) it is about you and me and the fact that we are (reading bracelet) best buds.
wow, is this friendship? i think so. check it out, we are bracelet buddies.
that is what they will call us.
oh, joey! sorry!
no that is all right. do not worry about it.
oh but look! that is going to leave a stain!
rach! hey! it is fine! you are at joey’s!
really?
yeah! look! (he throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
I have never lived like this before.
i know.
all right, do not waste it, i mean its still food. (he picks it up and eats it.)
all right I have been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because i want to be a good friend, and damnit i am a good friend. so just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses joey).
wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and i did not get it. but that was a hell of a kiss. rachel is a very lucky girl.
all right. let us get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (he removes the waste bucket that is over the duck and the laundry basket that is over the chicken.) and they are off! (he puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
get your foot off my contestant! judge!
judge rules, no violation.
ohhh.
and the duck gets the nutter-butter!
(turning from ross.) no!! hey-hey that is not a nutter-butter, that is just an old wonton!
judge rules, nutter-butter.
ohh, tough call.
yeah.
I would seen this thing on the discovery channel...
wait a minute! i saw that! on the discovery channel, yeah! about jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at monica) ewwww!! you peed on yourself?!
you can not say that!! you-you do not know!! i mean i thought i was going to pass out from the pain! anyway i-i tried, but i-i could not...bend that way. so... (looks at joey.)
that is right i stepped up! she is my friend and she needed help! and if i had too, I would pee on anyone of you!
umm, no. no best friend, no. just a lot of close friends.
really? me? wow! i do not even know any huge gay people!
it hurts me. it physically hurts me.
what? are you referring to my man's bag? at first, i thought it just looked good, but it is practical too. check it out! it is got compartments for all your stuff! your wallet! your keys! your address book!
your make-up!
okay. now-now-now should i climb down your front so we are face to face or-or should i climb down your back so we are-we are butt to face.
i think face to face.
i would say that.
face to face, yeah!
okay, here i go.
all right.
(grunting) oh my… how much do you weigh ross?!
i prefer not to answer that right now, I am still carrying a little holiday weight.
y’know, when we talked about face to face, i do not think we thought it all the way through.
hey pheebs! (he sits down next to her.)
hey!
check it out. (he turns around, pulls down his pants, and shows phoebe that he is got panties on.) how much of a man am i?!
wow! nice! manly and also kind of a slut.
you are turning into a woman.
no I am not. why would you say that? that is just mean.
now I have upset you? what did i say?
it is not what you said. it is the way you said it… oh my god, I am a woman!!!
great nap.
it really was.
uh me? gay? no! no. no, but i have a number of close friends who are. (chandler and ross look at each other.)
oh-oh-oh-oh, how i do it is, i look a woman up and down and say, "hey, how you doing?"
oh, please!
(to phoebe) hey, how you doing?
hey! how you doing?
I would love to show ya, but i just tucked her in. she is sleeping. (the women both laugh) hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. it turns out that joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a porsche.)
oh my god, jill!
oh my god, introduce us!
this is chandler. (points at him.)
and you know monica and ross!
hi jill.
and that is phoebe (points), and that is joey.
hey, (in the joey voice) how you doing?
do not!! (joey backs away frightened.)
oh! i see what happened. it is because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you would feel a lot different if i turned it on.
oh, i do. (gives her the joey-love look.) how you doin?
what?!?! oh dear god!
not much to tell there I am really shy.
oh great! great! thank you. (they shake hands.)
bye-bye. (the interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.) i did it!
yeah!
amazing! amazing!
oh, i do not watch soap operas. excuse me, i have a life, y’know?
oh, good to know. (the interviewer leaves.) so close!
wow! i can not believe they did not put it in the part where you said you did not watch soap operas.
yeah, i called the lady about that. i told her i was just joking. she was pretty nice about that.
you slept with her did not you?
little bit, yeah.
wow! this picture of you sure is steamy.
oh yeah, that is just a little something for my huge gay fan base. (winks at him.)
did you just wink at me?
hey, you are the one that loves the picture.
(to bonnie) so ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
tell it again. (pause, we see rachel is not amused.) seriously.
(to monica) i mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
yeah, sure. well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
joey, she was listing the countries she is done it in.
well, i think we all learned something.
(entering, hurridly) hey, you guys! look what i found! look at this! (she hands chandler a picture) that is my mom’s writing! look.
(reading the back of the picture) me and frank and phoebe, graduation 1965.
y'know what that means?
that you are actually 50?
no-no, that is not, that is not me phoebe, that is her pal phoebe. according to her high school yearbook, they were like b.f.f. (ross and bonnie look at her quizzically) best friends forever.
that is so cool.
i know! so this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my dad is. so i looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. so maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
that is too bad.
(sarcastic) ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
so great! okay! tomorrow we are going to drive out to montauk.
hey, bonnie had sex there!
(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) would you look at them. am i ever going to find a boyfriend again? i going to die an old maid.
you are not going to die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
(sarcastic) thanks!
hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I will be your boyfriend.
yeah right.
why is that so funny?
you made a joke right? so i laughed.
ha-ha-ha. a little to hard. what am i not ah, boyfriend material?
well, no. you are chandler. y'know, chandler! (hits him on the arm)
okay, so we have established my name, and hit me. but theoretically y'know, i mean say we were not friends, say it is a blind date. i show up at your door, and I am like (in a fake voice) “hey, nice to meet, ya. hey, oh-hey.”
well I would probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
(walking up carrying a brown paper bag) hey!
oh, hey! oh good, you brought food!
no, it is just my luggage.
woo-hoo! all right! yeah!
oh, i am having the best karma this week. first, i find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
yeah? what about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
oh, i was not talking about his karma.
(approaching) hey!
hey!
hey-hey, check out the hat!
what a minute, i know that hat! i was taken aboard that hat! they did experiments on me! i can not have children!!
seriously, where did you get the hat?
ross gave it to me.
yeah, i think she looks good.
ohh, thank you.

well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, i am here to tell you that hats are back.
and this time, they have ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
go, go, go!
oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!

what is with all this sand? (picking a handful of sand off of the floor, which is covered in sand)
oh, yeah, bob said there might be flood damage.
yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
(at the door) knock, knock, knock.
(entering) are you ah, phoebe abott?
hi phoebe abott, I am your best friends daughter!

(disappointed) oh, okay. well, so tell me everything about my parents. everything.

she was acting, she was pretending like she has not heard from him on years, but i found this picture on her fridge, and look (shows monica)! is not this what he would look like now?
(gasps) totally familiar. (phoebe shows the rest of them.)
oh, yeah.
well, why would she lie to you?
i do not know, but we are having dinner tomorrow night, so i figured, she is going to tell me then. y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, i do not know! so, you are all bored?
yes!
all right, I am going to close my eyes and point to someone, and you, whoever i point has to come up with something fun for us to do, and we have to do it.
okay, all right.

monica, if you get five cool points, you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. it has not happened yet, but we are all very excited.
okay, come on! (blows on the dice) daddy needs a new pair of electromagnetic microscopes for the prehistoric forensics department! (they all look at him, and he shuts up and rolls the dice.) (he moves his piece) okay. (reading a card) take pinky tuscadero up to inspiration point, collect three cool points!! yeah! which gives me five, and let us see who is going to lose their clothes. ummmm, i think i pick our strip poker sponsor mr. joey tribianni.
all right, relax. it is just a shoe.
(reading a card) okay, your band is playing at arnold’s, collect three cool points. which means, i have five, and that means i get joey’s boxers!
fine. gang up on me! i got you all right where i want you.
come on, take ‘them off!!
actually, y'know it is kind of cold, so how about i keep my boxers on, and give you all a peek at the good stuff?
(getting up) all right, I am going to make more margaritas! (she pours the rest of the pitcher into ross’s glass.)
whoa, hey! what are doing? trying to get me drunk?
I am just making margaritas.
okay.
i think I will help her out. (she gets up to go over and help rachel, and reveals she has no pants.) (to rachel) what is going on here?
what?!
you painting his toenails?
oh, come on!
chasing him all around the room?
monica, please?
he is totally flirting with you too.
(pause) he is, is not he? i do not know, i do not know, i mean maybe it is just being here at the beach together or, i do not know. but it is like something... (she is interrupted by the sound of bonnie entering)
hey! (rachel is shocked) hi bonnie!
oh.
we are playing strip happy days game!
so, you still do not think I am boyfriend material?
huh?
i saw you checking me out during the game last night.
you did not even take off your pants.
yeah, well, lucky for you.
what?
i do not know.
(entering) well! is everybody else having just the best time?!
shhh! shhhh! joey’s asleep.
after he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
well i assume the ah, happy couple is not up yet. did you guys hear them last night?
oh, yeah, i do not know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
good morning.
oh, great.
like a log.
I am going for a walk.
(to joey) good morning. nice breasts by the way.
oh, ah nothing. i just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.
ohhhh, sorry i missed that.
ohh-ha-ha!
y'know, i got to tell ya, i just loved your look when you were bald.
ohh!
really?!
i mean you definitely should do that.
yeah!
awww, stop. come on. now go shave that head!
what is the matter, pheebs?
she cancelled! my namesake cancelled on me!
what?!
yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. she is avoiding me, she does not want to tell me where my father is. she knows, and she will not tell me.
aww pheebs, that sucks!
yeah, well, do not “aww pheebs, that sucks!” me yet. (she starts to leave)
where ya going?
well, she is out of town so, there is got to be something in her house that tells me where my father is.
uh, pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
well, are any of those people here?!
okay, look i-i-i do something nice, okay? I will-I will fill her ice trays.
wh-haa-haa! look what ‘cha did! (rachel has her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.)
nooo, but it, but it is great.
okay. (he gently touches it.) you can feel all the bones in your skull.
hi.
hi!
i was having a little chat with ah, bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? oh, that is right, that is right, it was you!
that was her idea, i just gave her a nudge.
she said you gave her the razor!
hey!
ahh, no, I am good.
okay, have fun! wooo!!
come on see, she does not look that bad.
you can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! what the hell were you thinking?!!
i do not know.
you do not know?! rach, you balded my girlfriend!
all right! ross, do you think it is easy for me to see you with somebody else?
y'know, hey! you are the one who ended it, remember?
yeah, because i was mad at you, not because i stopped loving you!
you still love me?
noo.
you still love me.
oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
noo, nnnnn. what does this mean? what do you, i mean do you want to, get back together?
noo! maybe! i, i do not know. ross, i still can not forgive you for what you did, i can not, i just, but sometimes when I am with you i just, i feel so...
what?!
i just, i feel, i-i just...
what?
i feel...
(to joey) noo!! i do not care! I am not, I am not going to playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
but i made cards!!
well! good night. (to ross) I am going upstairs.
(to ross) want to play strip poker for practice?
ow! my ass. okay. okay. (she manages to climb completely inside and the window slams shut.) oh, shhh!
no! no!! it is me! it is me! i-i did not want to make any noise!
I am sorry.
i-i, came to fill your ice cube trays.
umm, okay, okay, look. i took this picture from your fridge. okay, because i know that this is my father. yeah, this is frank buffay and you are standing right there next to him. now, look i deserve to know where i came from. all right? so if you can help me find my father then you should! otherwise, you are just mean! (pause) so, just tell me the truth!
my father is chuck magioni?
oh.
heh?
I am telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
that is not true! her, she does not even know what she wants! rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
okay, then you got to back away, all right? you do not need that kind’ve hurt. take it from a guy who is never had a long term relationship......
i know, but ahhhhhh!! i really want to go up there and finish that kiss!
ahhhh! (steps away from her.)
oh, ahh, no thanks, i just had an m&m.
good night.
okey-dokey!
there is not one hair on that head.
hey, it will grow back, right? and she-she is really fun, and she is cool, and-and I am finally moving on. y'know? i mean getting over rachel was so (makes an incoherent nasal sound), y'know? y'know, and I am finally feeling sane again. and now if i go up there, and-and i kiss her, and, gooood i want to kiss her, and-and-and it does not work out, right? do i really want to put myself through that again?
so let me get this straight. if you go with bonnie tonight, you are doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
yeah.
right, and you go with rachel, bonnie’s free tonight?
(entering the bedroom) hi. (closes the door)
(in a fake voice) hi there.
that is that weird voice again.
okay! okay! let me try it again, you are going to want to date this next guy, i swear!
hi! I am dorf! you are date for the evening. (monica walks away in disgust) oh come on! dorf on dating, that is good stuff!!
(dejected) hi, you guys.
hey!
hi!
what is the matter?
well it is just—it is one of those situations that i just hate. y’know? a massage client gave me three tickets to the helmet-pelts exhibit at the morgan chase museum.
(nodding knowingly) now you are thinking you got to sleep with him.
no! no! it is just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
I will give up my ticket.
me too.
okay that is so generous!
and i think ross is generous too.
great! okay then it is just us girls!
yeah.
so what-what is the exhibit.
it is mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
oh man! (hits chandler)
(entering) hey!
hi!
hey!
hey ross listen chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
thanks? but i have plans; elizabeth and i are going out of town.
oh that is great!
yeah.
i mean think about all the money that you are going to make!
why? what?
well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
no, no, that is funny. but maybe it is time to move on, let it go, y’know? stop it! besides, rachel is going out with elizabeth’s father, so ah, he is much older than she is. looks like I am not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
i mean ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
okay, okay. uh, well uh, rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (paul enters) in his ear.
ross.
oh, come on you guys; that is funny! y’know? because he is need—he is got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘because-‘because y’know, ‘because he is all old, and…
really? that okay, that is great.
all right look, i-i realize it upsets you.
but, elizabeth and i are-are both adults and so i do not think there is really anything you can do about it.
ohh! a man with a plan!
oh, this is so exciting! you get your picture back up on the wall of fame! eek!
i know. it was so cool when i was up there before. me and jim belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… then i get fired off of days of our lives and he takes me down. now he is just laughing at me. look at him, that smug belushi bastard, I will…
(gasps) ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to matt lauer. look at him, smiling at me. (giggles) yeah i know; we would be great together!
hey! so I am back.
joey tribbiani! from the wall! (the dry cleaner does not remember) okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? (holds his picture up in front of his face.) huh? okay eh-ah-anyway, I am ready to go back up on the wall I am the star of a new tv show.
oh well, it is not on tv yet.
okay, fine, i will bring you a tape, huh? (walks away)
so umm, now do you have any of matt lauer’s clothes here? maybe? just ones that have not been cleaned yet?
oh, i love museums!
umm.
soakin’ up all the culture.
yeah.
where do you want to start?
ooh, the gift shop!
yeah!
hey, and then lunch.
oh, wait yes, but i can not eat too much. paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
oh wow. what, do you think maybe he is going to tell you that he is gay?
what?! no! why?!
no reason! that would just be a really big surprise, right?
i did not know you could get married here.
this would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but i would not put the aisle there and i would never have the ceremony there! (points to both places.) i mean you would have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. (the arch at the entrance to the room.)
oh sorry did not mean to interrupt. it is just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
what?! are you crazy?! I am not getting married! I am not even engaged.
yeah, but there is a two-year wait. and then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. that is four years. chandler’s not going to wait that long. he is going to find somebody else, y’know? someone, someone who did put their name on the list. (rachel agrees.)
yeah hon, it can not hurt to put your name down! i mean in if two years if you are not engaged you just do not use it.
well, i mean i guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
I am going to do it too!
me too!
really? who would, who would you marry?
i do not know, i do not have anyone right now. y’know?
oh pheebs.
do not feel too sorry for me. at least my boyfriend is not gay.
phoebe, that stuff is…
do not even get me started on yours!
(entering) hey! so, did you watch the tape of my show?
all right, let us get me back up there! (holds out his picture.)
what—but you saw the show!
dry cleaners?
okay! okay, look! you-you-you got harrison ford up there!
okay well that may be true. but, in-in okay, air force one the russians were terrorists! and evil! and plus he kills a bunch of them! that-that-that is offensive to russians.
oh you should, it is great.
this place is really beautiful!
wow! the only thing i got from my grandmother was her eyes. i mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—do-do you want to make out?
ehh, i was just, i was just thinking about your father.
no. no-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
yeah.
(loudly) why?! are there like bears or something?! (looks around and then sees that elizabeth is shaking her head no and realizes what elizabeth meant.) ohh. oh, protection. yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that i forgot.
oh no! hey-hey, I am the guy! I will get it.
no.
a little bit.
okay.
ohh, okay.
(from another room) oh my god, what a great surprise! this is such a beautiful house.
(on machine) you have reached monica and chandler’s, if you are listening to this message, we are probably screening. (to himself) yeah we are.
(on phone) this is chandler bing! this is chandler bing! (listens) yes, the groom—no! not the groom!!
it is so secluded up here.
i feel like we are the only two people in the world. (she sets down her wine class, picks up a walnut, and knocks another one on the floor.) oops. sorry. (she reaches down to pick it up and ross hands it to her. ross is hiding under the couch and causes rachel to scream.)
no-no! big bear! big bear outside! i think i-i—would you—actually, would you go check on that?
well, okay. would-would you get me a diet coke?
okay. (after paul leaves rachel drops to the floor to confront ross.) what?! what are you doing here?!
what are you doing here?!
i came with paul!
yeah, i recognize the ankles!
get up!
ahh. thank you!
op, ice. i need ice.
thank you.
(under the couch) you and your ice.
ugh! get out! get out! go! come on! (ross gets up and heads for the kitchen.) no! not in there! he is in there! (she points ross to the door next to the kitchen.)
(before entering) did you really hear a bear?
go-go!
ohh, thank you.
well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
well, why do y’know go in that room (points to the room ross is in) and do your homework?
that is your, that is your dad’s bedroom. (yelling) that is your dad’s bedroom!
whoa, that diet coke just went straight to my head! woo!
hi, honey.
(gets up) see you later. (starts to leave.)
what? i-i bought groceries, i was going to make you dinner!
(angrily) well next time ask! or at least wait for me to ask! (he storms out.)
oh no!
oh please, he did not hear it! he did not hear it!!
(on machine) this is chandler bing! this is chandler bing! (the machine beeps off.)
noooo!!!!!!!!
uh yeah, where-where is the guy who decides who is pictures go up on the wall?
oh, you are kidding me! all-all right, well make sure you tell him that joey tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. okay? I am an actor; I am kind of getting my picture up there on the wall.
oh really? well, maybe you and i go out for drinks? (pause) you are the other one right? (she thinks about it for a second and nods yes.)
really? okay. okay, i-I will go upstairs. (to paul) if-if you get me something from the car.
surprise me.
(yelling) so you are going to be in the car, i will be upstairs, and that is where everybody’s going to be!
phoebe!
yeah?
have you seen chandler?!
no! why?
the woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and chandler heard! (phoebe gasps.) i know! how bad is this?!
well for the regular guy, it is bad, but chandler, oh dear god!
i know! i know! and he totally freaked out and i can not find him anywhere!
what are you going to do?
well, I am never going to listen to you again, that is for sure! (mimicking her.) "y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"
rachel said that!
well rachel’s not here! (runs out.)
oh! here it is! (noticing it next to the door.) ooh, joey! why did you sign it, "son of a bitch?" (son of a bitch is written across the entire picture.)
i did not do that! who would have done that?!
okay, maybe ask this guy.
well, what did he do?
joey!
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, i-i—hey! i did not go out with your wife! (the same woman from before enters.) okay? i went out with her! (points at her.)
well, we should go.
yeah.
elizabeth! (he opens one of the bed stands that he has curled himself up into.) okay. okay. (she helps him out.) I am going to go out this window. (points to the window next to him.) I will meet you at the front door. just tell them you are going home, okay?
(yelling from the living room) oh wait-wait-wait!! no! do not go in there! do not go in there! i need another soda!
oh my god ross! what in heaven’s name are you doing here?
(to elizabeth) and that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
okay, please-please paul, just let me explain…
all right, fine! fine! have me fired! but uh, i want you to know that you and i are not all that different. i mean, i too am a neat guy. (paul just looks at him.)
and i too am just a love machine. (hums a little bit and mimics paul’s flexing.)
(going over to him) I am so sorry. please, stop freaking out.
I am not freaking out. why would i be freaking out? a woman named heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (does one of those chandler noises.)
honey, we were at this beautiful place, and i-i-i just put our names down for fun! i mean, what is the harm in that?
right here! (clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
chandler, please do not think i was trying to pressure you. phoebe and rachel…
phoebe and rachel! so the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, phoebe and rachel, heldi, and apparently some band called starlight magic 7 who are available by the way!
it was a mistake. please do not take this to mean anything, because it does not.
okay.
really?
yes, if it really does not mean anything, because you know that I am just not ready…
i know! i know.
okay. (they hug.)
I am going to go tell joey that (laughs) that you are back. i was really worried about you. (exits.)
(entering from her room) hey, did she buy it?
totally.
so did heldi show you the place?
yeah, it is beautiful.
i can not believe you are going to ask monica to marry you!
i know.
hey gunther.
oh uh, well i just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
no! no, i quit a long time ago. (pause) did i forget to you that one? I am sorry.
great! (takes his coffee and leaves.)
okay rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. ross, double latte, $2.75. chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. and pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. so, all together that is (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.
this coming from the man who could not split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
hi!
oh that is on the house courtesy of joey tribbiani.
well, he is not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, i good check with him—he says it is okay. (she hands him her card.) great! thanks! bye-bye!
hey joey, how come our stuff is not free?
it will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! this is great! I am getting more dates than ever!
wait a minute, you are only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
yeah joey that is so gross!
how about a scone on the house baby?
(giggles) I am pretty.
hey does anyone have any gum?
oh i do! (she grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) oh, y’know what? no. (pause) wait a second. (she removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) i know it is in here somewhere.
y’know what? I am good! I am good!
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey, what are you doing here? should not you be at work?
(congested) ugh, they sent me home. they said i can not work if I am sick.
I am so sorry you are sick.
I am not sick!! i do not get sick! getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
honey, no one thinks you are a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. (she notices something hanging from monica’s nose, as does joey.)
(wiping her nose) i have not been sick in over three years! (sneezes.)
I am going to grab you some tissue.
i do not need a tissue! I am fine-d!
when you put a ‘d’ at the end of ‘fine’ you are not fine.
I am fine-d. I am fine-d! y’know, it is a really hard word to say.
yes?
oh my god, jill!
oh my god, introduce us!
this is chandler. (points at him.)
and you know monica and ross!
hi jill.
and that is phoebe (points), and that is joey.
hey, (in the joey voice) how you doing?
do not!! (joey backs away frightened.) (to jill) honey, what are you doing here?!
(to ross) which-which sister is this? is this the spoiled one or that is bitter?
never mind, i got it.
wow! what did he say?
oh! did you hear that?! my dad’s proud of me! my dad’s proud of me.
rach? (points to jill.)
oh yeah, sorry. wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
you bought a boat?
boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (rachel glares at him.)
jill, honey, i think this is the best thing that could have ever happened to you. i mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! and you know when i did it, i-i-i at first i was scared, and look at me now! I am the only daughter dad is proud of! okay, well this is, this is what you are going to do. you are going to get a job, you are going to get an apartment, and then I will help you and you can stay with us. right pheebs, she can stay with us?
of course, yeah!
ooh, i like cards.
(to a customer) are you all finished here?
great! (joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)
what?!
well if it is free food, how come you are charging me for it?
well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
(to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) sorry! (he grabs her muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)
jill, how did you pay for all this? i thought your dad took away your credit card.
i do not think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
seriously, i do not rachel’s going to think it is a good idea.
i would love that job!
(entering) hey! what is going on?
(notices jill’s bags) jill! did you shop?!
you went shopping?! what, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under jill’s nose when you know she is trying to quit. wow, you guys are terrible!
sorry jill.
sorry-sorry jill.
what did you get?
oh well, all right, i got (ross hands her a bag) (to ross) thank you, i got uh, this y’know "i want a job sweater." (holds up the same sweater.)
oh.
and, and then i got uh, these are apartment pants.
apartment pants?
yeah, you never heard of them?
no, of course, of course I have heard of them! ross, what did you get?
huh? oh, i got this—(holds up this pink frilly thing)—this!
a pajmena?
yeah! oh, i-i love this babies!
really?
ross, wants a pajmena?
it is a rug. (jill winces.)
jill?
oh, come on! you think that is going to work on me?! i invented that!
all right, it is okay. one little setback is okay, just do not let it happen again, all right? now since daddy paid for all this stuff, i should take it all away. but I am just going to take the-the pajmena. (ross hands it to her.) and the uh, and the uh pants. y’know what, I am just going to take it all away, ‘because that way you will just really learn the lesson. okay? all righty, I am going to run a couple of errands and i will see you at dinner. (leaves with all of jill’s stuff.)
yeah. everything but, the little blue one. (holds it up for her.)
well. hey…
oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "I am sorry!"
what about, what about when i said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was i?
oh stop.
no, you stop!
(gets up and sits between them) okay-okay, why do not i sit here and you will both stop it!
okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? let us do something crazy!
i know, let us rest and drink lots of fluids. (holds up a glass of orange juice.)
okay, I will rest. but y’know if I am going to bed, then you are coming with me.
that would be impossible to resist if you were not all drippy here. (points to his nose.)
(wiping her nose) are you saying that you do not want to get with this? (tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it does not work all that well with the big robe.)
yeah, i do not you should say that even when you are healthy.
(in a sexy voice) come on. (coughs loudly.)
do not take this personally okay? it is just that i just can not have sex with a sick person.
I am with you chandler! i mean i can not have sex with a sick person either, that is disgusting! but I am not sick! let me prove it to you. we are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
that is the thing, see i would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
hey!
hey.
what is up?!
umm, i think there is something you should maybe know.
well, it would better not be about the apartment pants, because i just pitched the idea to my boss at ralph lauren and she loved it.
no. no. it is just i was umm, i was with ross and jill after you left and umm, I am pretty sure i saw a little spark between them.
what?!
yeah i mean it is probably nothing, but i just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
with ross and jill?
yeah!
with ross and my sister?
yeah.
with my sister jill and my ex-boyfriend ross?
yeah.
oh there is no way.
okay then.
oh my god! i can not believe that! i mean i do not really like it when ross goes out with anyone, but my sister is not that like incest or something?! oh my god, and they are going to have sex! oh! oh no what if he marries her too?! oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. and i can not stop it! i can not—i do not own ross! y’know? and jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! and oh my god, i can not believe ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. oh my god, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
but great news about the apartment pants, huh?
that will be $3.85.
it is just i can not because my manager said i… (gets an idea) (starts singing) "happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. happy birthday dear annie…
(still singing) "…amy! happy birthday to you!"
yeah, not it here it is not.
(on the couch) oh hi! y’know, i just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
that is great. hey, y’know who does not have to job hunt? ross. he works at the university.
oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you are going to go out?
i just, phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.
yeah.
oh not-not so much. umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with ross?
are-are you saying he is a geek?
no! no i, no ross is not a geek!
what handsome is not your type? smart? kind? good kisser? what those things are not on your list? ross is a great guy! you would be lucky to be with him!
oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that is not what i meant.
yeah but, he is not your type.
yeah but, you do not, you do not, you do not want to try to much too fast. y’know? i mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast do not you?
she-she died jill.
(still sick) chandler!
oh what is it honey, you need some tea? some soup? (he gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. or at least she is trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) oh-ohhhh!
(trying to be seductive) calling dr. big, dr. big to the bed.
oh jeez honey, i thought, i thought you were asleep.
how could i be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
i was asleep. (she takes off her robe and starts to shiver) oh no! no-no honey! y’know what is sexy? layers. layers are sexy. and blankets are sexy. and oh! hot water bottles are sexy.
come on, get into bed! i want to prove to you that I am not sick! i want to make you feel, as good as i feel. (sneezes.)
would you please get some rest!
I am fine. (she goes into one of those half sneezing, half-coughing fits that you get with a bad cold or flu.)
(singing) "happy birthday to you!"
what? no-no it is her birthday!
but it really…
damnit! (storms off.)
(entering) rach? hi!
hi!
did you tell your sister to ask me out?
well yeah…
oh wow! i mean, wow! i mean, i-i-i think she is cute but i-i would never have thought of going out with her, never!
really?!
yeah but after you said it was okay, i figured, "why not?!"
oh so-so not really never.
i have to say you are a much bigger person than i am. i mean after all we have been through, i just—y’know i wish i had a brother to reciprocate. hey, if you ever want to go out with monica, you have my blessing.
(overhearing them) oh-ho, and mine!
(entering) chandler, i think I am sick.
really? struck down in the pribe of libe!
okay, fine i admit it! i feel terrible! would you please rub this on my chest? (she hands him some of that vicks vap-of-rub to put on.)
no-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
come on! i really need your help!
no-no-no-no-no!
fine, I will rub it on myself.
okay.
so you are just, kind of rubbing it on yourself?
yeah?
it is nice.
are you kidding me?! is this; is this turning you on?
yes! (hangs his head in shame.)
i can not believe it! what is it? is it the rubbing or the smell?
it is all very, very good. (she covers up and sits down.) so you want to go uh, mix it up?
not now, I am sick!
oh come on you big faker!
what happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
well that was before all the vaporizing action.
okay, if you really want to have sex…
okay! (runs into the bedroom.)
worked like a charm.
hi! wh-what are you doing here?
well, i-i do not like it.
it is kind of slutty.
yeah well, I am-I am a slut.
(entering) hi jill!
hi (sees rachel and forgets her name for a moment).
rachel.
rachel! well, you-you are not at home, you are-you are-you are right here.
yeah i know, and i bet you thought it would be weird. but it is not!
okay. so well I will umm, (to rachel) I will have her home by midnight.
why are not you home yet?!
(calling from the bathroom) is someone there?
oh yes, it is me! sorry!
(calling from the bathroom) what are you doing here?
uh, I am just, I am just looking out your window. at-at the view. what are you guys doing?
we got some vap-of-rub in some places.
(gasps) oh, he brought her back to his apartment.
(entering with chandler) who? (she looks out the window at ross’s apartment) is that your sister?
ugh, she is a slut!
god, ross is on a date with your sister! how weird is that?!
oh my god, look-look he is taking off her clothes!
he is taking off her coat!
oh, this is just terrible.
oh no it is not, no it is not. it is a first date. I am sure that nothing is going to…(as she is talking we see ross close his drapes.)
oh. (squeaks again.)
ho-oh, he is going to get some! (rachel looks at him.) of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. y’know so umm, he is closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. (pause) well, I am off to bed! (goes to bed.)
hey, remember when i had a monkey?
yeah.
yeah, what, what was i thinking?
(he is just picked up their bill) hey! so, what is with the 20 percent tip? did i do something wrong?
twenty percent is a pretty generous tip joe.
y’know what is more generous than that?! fifty percent! y’know what is even more generous than that?!!
i see where you are going!
what is up with the greed joe?
all right, look I am sorry you guys, but it is just that i got to get these new head shots made. and they are really expensive, y’know? I am down to like three! well, actually two ‘because one of ‘them i kind of blackened in some teeth—why did i do that?! (hits himself in the head.)
well is not there something you can do to earn a little extra money? i mean, can not-can not you pick up, i do not know, an extra shift here?
or, y’know, i used to beg for money. of course it helps if you have got y’know a little of this (she sticks her chest out and shakes it) going on. wow! i still have it!
oh, wait! wait! do not you have an audition today? yeah! maybe you will get that job!
oh, ha-ha-ha! ooh! wait a minute, i used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
(reminiscing) ah, finally an explanation.
no-no! i used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? let us see uh, well i do not want to donate sperm again. (to ross) i really prefer doing that at the home office y’know? (ross nods his head.) ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
yeah?
uhh do it?
well, where was i? (takes a sip of the coffee.)
hi!
hey!
hey, what have you guys been up to?
ohh! we went to a self-defense class today!
wow!
yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
takes it out of you? (laughs.)
now, we can kick anybody’s ass!
yeah!
after one class? i do not think so.
what? you want to see me self-defend myself?! go over there (points) and pretend you are a sexual predator! go on! i dare ya!!
well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that is not enough. look, i studying kara-tay for a long time, and there is a concept you should really be familiar with. it is what the japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.
is not that a kind of sushi?
no, it is a concept!
yeah it is! it is! it is freshwater eel!
all right, maybe it means that too…
ohh! i would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
y’know what? fine! get attacked! i do not even care!
(deadpan) come on ross. we are sorry. please tell us what it is.
unagi is a state of total awareness. okay? only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
you mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
(moves closer) all I am saying is, it is one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, i do not know, like a (turns and puts his face close to rachel’s and screams) surprise!!
all right, you know that one was coming, but that does not mean you have unagi. (does the finger thing.)
(to phoebe) ooh! y’know what? if we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
y’know what… (moves away as chandler enters, panicked.)
hey-hey, is monica here?
no.
no.
okay, look i need your help, i do not know what to get her for valentine’s day.
well, valentine’s day was like two weeks ago, so i would not get her a calendar!
(laughs) she was working on valentine’s day so we are celebrating it tonight.
ohh, hey! why do not you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
ooh, joey, that is actually a really good idea!
and of course, crotchless panties.
well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend (pause) and her brother, (the camera pans to ross flashing joey a very evil look; joey gets scared) i can not do that we promised we would make each other gifts this year.
aw, i love that.
you guys!
you can not make crotchless panties? you take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…
(interrupting him) okay-okay-okay! so, making things. that sounds like so much fun.
yeah, i thought so to until i paper mached one of my eyes shut.
oh, i love paper mache! what did you make?
i made a… (does one of those gibberish words.)
what is that?
nothing!
so what are you going to do?
well, have you guys made anything that maybe i can take credit for?
ohh! i have! i have! i started making these little sock bunnies! (she takes out a sock that is been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) oh for crying out loud!
hey, wait a minute! that is my sock!
now, it is you little bunny friend. (she sticks it in rachel’s face and they both laugh.)
(admiring his work) this, this actually is a… (does the same gibberish word from before.)
(entering) hey!
hey! honey, can i ask you a question about the valentine’s day gifts?
oh, yeah.
do we have to make the entire thing?
yes! why, did you—you forget to make yours?
of course, of course not. i just have to uh, go over to the place where i-i made it and pick-pick it up.
okay. (they kiss.) okay, i can not wait! this is going to be the best valentine’s day ever! (chandler giggles and exits.) i can not believe it! make the presents! make the presents!
(sticking his head back in) what?
I am just so excited to make the presents! (chandler does another sarcastic/scared laugh and leaves.) shoot!
(to the receptionist) hi uh, I am joey tribbiani and with all do respect I would like to donate some fluids.
oh that is too bad. I have kind of been saving up. (she just looks at him in horror.) uh, are you sure there is no studies i can participate in?
thanks. (starts to read it.) well but this one starts now. (points to one.)
but it is $2,000.
well how about this one? testing the effects of joey tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
danger!!! danger!!!!!
ross!!!
what the hell was that?!
a lesson in the importance of unagi. (he starts doing the finger thing every time now.)
ohh, you are a freak!!
perhaps. now I am curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
all right, so we were not prepared!
I am sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but i—look, i just want you guys to be safe. (monica comes out to throw out the garbage and ross screams…) danger!!!!! (she completely ignores him and keeps walking.) ahhh, huh? unagi.
(in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. oh, i wish i had a twin. where could i find someone who looks exactly like me? (the camera widens its shot to reveal a room full of joey look-a-likes. joey looks at the guy next to him and then back at his script.)
hey.
(not turning around) chandler. i sensed it was you.
what?!
unagi. I am always aware.
okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?
what is up?
i can not figure out what to make monica.
oh, why do not you make her one of your little jokes.
I am going crazy! okay? do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
y’know what? she would-she would love this. (picks up a model of the saturn v rocket, that is the one that took man to the moon.) uh, it is an exact replica of apollo 8. i made it in the sixth grade.
yeah, i guess i could use that. i could say that your love sends me to the moon.
yeah-yeah, except apollo 8 did not actually land on the moon. but you-you-you could write that umm, your love let us me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the christmas story from the orbit of the moon on christmas eve, 1968. they also took the famous earthrise picture of the earth rising over the moon.)
wait a minute, i can not give this to her.
why not?
because it says "captain ross" on the side and "i hate monica" on the bottom.
oh.
ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (she does the finger thing.)
okay. okay. (he goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. he takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. then he holds it out as if he is giving it to her.) yes honey, i made it myself. (he throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. he turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) i can not do it. i can not do it. (he throws them both down and continues looking. he opens another closet door and finds a tape.) oh! oh! a mixed tape! a mixed tape!! (he runs out into the living room.)
hey! hi! you uh, ready to exchange gifts?
sure! okay, you go first.
okay, come here! come here.
okay! (she takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)
now, it is not wrapped because i just, just finished it.
okay.
but i made you a tape of what i think are all romantic songs.
oh, what a great gift! is the way you look tonight on it?!
(momentarily terrified) maybe we will have to listen and see!
oh, i love it! thank you so much!
okay!
okay, you ready to open yours?
yeah!
okay.
it is a sock bunny.
yeah-yeah, you remember how i call you bunny?
not really.
well, i did one time, and-and i want to start doing it more. see that is what this is about.
i see. y’know umm, phoebe makes sock bunnies.
no! no, she does not. uh phoebe, what she makes—that is uh—they are sock rabbits. they are completely different—okay! okay! okay! i did not make it! I am sorry! i totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we are supposed to make the presents!
oh, it is okay. i do not…
no-no, it is not okay! it is not! i mean you were just… you are so incredible! you went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! y’know I am just going to—i, i am going to make this up to you! i will! i-i am going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and i am going to do anything you want in there! (points to the bedroom.)
(thinking it over) well, i did put a lot of thought in the tape. (they both run into the bedroom.)
wow! (to the sock bunny still on his hand.) you are way to young to have seen that!
oops! (covers its eyes.) y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say i forget to get you a present for that too?
you are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
we have got to wash that! (referring to the sock bunny.)
yeah! (takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)
do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
you have done enough!
i want to wake up early and go get it for you!
no you do not—get it in black, not brown.
oop, your cake is ready!
oop!
well, it is like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
who the hell are you?!
(entering) no! no! no! no! no! how you doing?! how you doing—damnit carl! go wait in the hall! (goes into the hall.)
look, i got to apologize on the behalf of carl.
who the hell is carl?!
oh, did i not mention? carl is a guy i hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, are not they?
okay, i know it sounds crazy, but i think it might work. y’know? the only problem is, carl’s acting is… (does the international hand symbol for so-so.)
the only problem!
yeah, he is the reason i did not get that big minute maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? we were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
(to carl) pizza!! we like pizza!! get out!!! (carl does so.)
pat sajak?
yep!
alex trebek?
oh, of course!
chuck woolery?
definitely! phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who is ass i cannot kick.
say it!
say we are unagi!
it is not something you are! it is something you have!
say it!
y’know what? i can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
all right carl, we are next. now remember, what is not going to be?
that is right! and what are you not going to do?
(gets very angry) damnit carl! (carl goes to say something more, and joey silences him with a grunt.)
that is us.
that is right, $2,000.
damnit carl!
oh my good god.
hey! continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. tonight, no. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
look, you have done enough! okay? you have to stop this now.
i will! but not tonight. for dinner music, i thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
oh, the mixed tape.
the way you look tonight is on here! dance with me?
you are just the sweetest. (they kiss.)
no! you are the sweetest! (he tries to kiss her but monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)
it is a great class.
yeah, yeah, i was watching. (the instructor just nods and walks away.) umm, hey, a couple of questions though. umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
no. no-no. no. what would you do next?
yes that is right.
i tired attacking two women, did not work.
no, i mean it is okay, i mean, they are-they are my friends. in fact, i-i-i was married to one of them.
oh, no! no-no! no, i tired! but i could not. that is why I am here. maybe we could attack them together? (he glares at him.) that-that is a no.
i am so, so, so, so sorry!
(not buying it) uh-huh.
and i will cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and do anything in there! (points to the bedroom.)
(pointing to the kitchen) yeah you will! (points to the bedroom) and, are you kiddin’ me?!
come on monica, it is our valentine’s day. please? please-please, please?
okay.
okay. (they hug.)
so, are we going in there?
i am!! (enter her room and closes the door behind her.)
ah-ha, nowhere to run! (he starts to run towards them.)
i do not like sitting up here! I am just going to over… (she starts to get up.)
(stopping her) no rachel! they got here first!
why is ross doing that?
danger!!!!
oh my god! why is he jumping on those women!
we should help him!
i… well, i do not think they need any help.
hey!
hey!
hey!
what are you guys doing up?
oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
(thinks) dark red.
yeah, i think that is wrong, but there is a connect the dots in here for you later. (to monica) hey, how about maroon?
(checks to see if it works) yes, you are so smart! (kisses him.)
aww, you guys are so cute!
i know.
all right, I will see you in the morning.
(looking at the bill) uhh, we still need a tip.
all right. hold on. (she starts digging in the chair.) i got it. nickel! (donates it.) how much more do we need?
a couple of bucks.
okay, dime! (donates that.) you guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. (finds something else.) oh no, wait! look it! whoa! (looks at it.) oh my god, this is a police badge!
wow!
oh that is so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they do not serve donuts. (no one laughs.) y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? i think i can come up with something better than that.
phoebe, i bet somebody is missing that badge.
yeah, i should probably take it back. ooh, but you know what? while I am at the police station, i could check their ten most wanted lists because my friend fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! (she crosses her fingers in hope.)
(entering) hey, you guys!
hey!
hey joey!
hey.
(to monica) hey. that uh, that my sweatshirt?
oh yes, it is. I am sorry i borrowed it, i was cold. i hope its okay?
well uh, it is just that uh, y'know if-if you are going to be wearing someone is sweatshirt should not it be your boyfriends--and I am not him.
I am sorry, I will give it back to you.
no-no! no! i mean it is going to be all smelling like monica!
are you saying i smell bad?
no! no, you smell like a meadow. (pause.) I am sorry. (runs to the bathroom.)
what is with him?
oh, y'know what? the last time joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
(disgusted at ross's antics) ugh!
(to rachel) yeah, i still do not know. (to the salesman who is hovering nearby) I am sorry i just want to make sure that i bought the right couch. i need a couch that says, "kids welcome here." but that also says, (in a sexy voice) "come here to me!"
what?! you say that to kids?!!
no! no! no! the "come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
ross, honey, it is a nice couch. it is not a magic couch.
yeah?
oh, sure. whoa-whoa, what is this? the delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
wait! no, that is ridiculous. come on, he lives three blocks away!
yeah, y'know what? I will take it myself, thank you! (he signs the form and hands it back to the salesman.) all right rach, let us go! (he picks up one end of the couch.)
yeah! (she puts on her coat and turns around and sees ross is expecting her to help.) (laughing.) are you kiddin'?
oh, come on it is only three blocks! and-and, it is not very heavy, try it! come on! come on!
(disgustedly she goes and tries to pick up the couch. much to her amazement, she is successful.) oh. oh! i can do it!
yeah!
oh yeah, we are uh, yeah we are not together. (he starts backing out of the store.)
ross!
what is that supposed to mean?
ross!
not that it is any of your business, but we did go out.
yeah! rach?
come on, i do not really want to be doing this right now. i am carrying a very heavy couch.
then tell him quickly.
(to ross) fine! (to the salesman) we went out.
not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
ross!! oh my--ugh!! you kept count?! you are such a loser!
a loser you did it with (to the salesman) 298 times!
oh. oh! madam? excuse me, madam?
you can not put your cigarette out on a tree!
no but you should not! do not ever do that again.
hold it! (grabs the badge) n.y.p.d! freeze punk!
yeah that is right you are so busted. (to no one in particular.) book  them.
save it red! unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
you apologize to the tree right now or i am calling for backup. (the woman calls her bluff.) (screaming at no one in particular) backup! backup!!
okay, cancel backup! cancel backup!
okay. (throws off the last cushion.)
ross, did not you say that there was an elevator in here?
uhh, yes i did but there is not. okay, here we go.
okay, go left. left! left! (the bottom of the couch is hitting the railing.)
okay, y'know what? there is no more left, left!
oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! straight up over your head! you can do it! you can do it! (she gets it lifted up and they make the first turn.) okay. you got it?
yeah.
good-good-good.
oh-oh!
yeah, you got it right? you got it right? you got it?
any chance you think the couch looks good there?
…so this guy was all (mumbles.) and I am all, buffay, homicide. (flashes the badge.) it was just so cool!
(cooking something) phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
i know but I am having so much fun doing good deeds.
okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you could get arrested.
you could get arrested, right now! (flashes the badge and they glare at her.) all right, yeah, i got to take it back. I am totally drunk with power. (she heads for the door just as joey enters.)
(to joey) hey.
(to phoebe) hey! (sees that monica's there.) oh.
hi, joe.
yeah, i did not know you guys were going to be here.
hey joey, sweetie, taste this. (holds out a spoon for him.)
(backing away) what?! why?!
what is going on with you?
nothing!
oh, come on! you have been acting strange all day!
all right! there is something. i kind of had a dream, (pause) but i do not want to talk about it. (starts for his room.)
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that? (imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) i kind of have a dream! i do not want to talk about it.
well, it involved monica.
you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing?! oh, that is so cool! (to monica) i can not tell you how many times I have dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (seeing monica's stare.) (to joey) anyway we are talking about your dream. (to monica) i love you. (to joey) your dream? (leans in to listen closely.)
do not worry, there was not any sex in it or anything. i have not dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two--ish.
what was the dream about?
well, okay. you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. y'know like you guys were doing last night. so, that is it. I am in love with monica and I will be moving out.
wait, joey! joey! that does not mean that-that you are in love with me!
it-it does not?
no!
no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you are jealous because I have become the apartment stud.
that kind of sounds like your dream dude.
or, it could mean that-that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.
um-hmm.
joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
(looks at her) not really.
well there you have it!
well sure! I am just wearing sweats! (looking at chandler and slowly realizing what his point is.) but that is good that you are not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
no, i do not think it is just about just getting a girlfriend. y'know? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe-maybe that is it?
friends first? that is interesting.
you become friends after?
no, never done that either.
(entering) hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
oh yeah, it is actually in my bedroom.
(laughing) that is right.
(noticing him) what is up joey?
(in a sexy voice) how you doing?
excuse me, is this your car?
well i do not think it is very nice of you to park here, y'know you are blocking the entrance.
well, it is a problem for me, which means it is a problem for you because I am a cop. (shows the badge.)
ohh, no. (pause) oh okay, so you are a cop which means you can park anywhere, because i know that because I am a cop too. so, all right, keep up the good work. 10-4. (tries to leave.)
i-I am with the umm, the 57th.
I am in vice. yeah, in fact I am undercover right now. I am a who are.
umm, do you know, umm sipowicz?
yeah, big guy, kind of bald.
(starts to walk away, but stops) do not try to call him or anything, because he is not there, he is out. his umm, his partner just died.
i-i sure will, take care. (starts walking off.)
oh. (she starts laughing. then she throws the badge at him and runs away.)
hey! joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch?
oh, I would love too, but i got acting class. but y'know what? i guess i can blow that off, (in a sexy voice) for you.
thanks!
uh, hey, rach let me ask you something. uh, i was just over there talking to monica and chandler, boy they are really tight.
i know.
yeah that is not such a bad situation they got going over there. I am thinking of getting me one of those.
what is up joe?
well, the reason i think monica and chandler are so great…
yeah?
…is because they were friends first. y'know? so i asked myself, "who are my friends?" you and phoebe, and i saw you first. so…
(laughing) what are you saying?
I am saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch.
y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as i am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, i just, i-i do not think we should be cranking anything up.
I will treat you real nice. (pulls out a chair for her.)
(laughs and pushes the chair back in) yeah, well, y'know umm… no honey, listen i think it is a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. do not hit on your existing friends!
will not-will not that take longer?
yeah. yeah. oh, but once you find it, ohh it is so worth the wait.
yeah. i understand. i understand. (pause) man, i wish i saw phoebe first!
come here to me. no-no, you come here to me.
(entering) hey ross! i brought reinforcements.
oh great! what, you brought joey?
well, i brought the next best thing.
(entering) hey!
chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica!
y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so…
look, i-i drew a sketch about how we are going to do it. (showing them) okay rach, (points to the sketch) that is you. that is the couch. (points again.)
whoa-oh, what is-what is that? (points.)
oh, that is me.
wow! you certainly think a lot of yourself.
no! that is-that is my arm!
(looking at the sketch) oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
y'know what? just-just follow my lead.
okay!
okay.
come on, chandler.
all right. (they start up the stairs. ross is first.) okay, here we go!
all right, ready?
yeah.
turn.
(straining) okay.
turn! turn!
okay, i do not think we can turn anymore!
ross, i do not, i just do not think it is going to fit.
oh yeah it will! come on, up! up-up-up! up! yes! here we go! pivot! (they start up the stairs again. chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) pivot! piv-ot! piv-et!! piv-ett!!! piv-et!
shut up! shut up! shut up!!
okay, i do not think it is going to pivot anymore.
all right, let us uh, let us bring it back down and-and try again.
okay, yeah, i think it is really stuck now.
i can not believe that did not work!
i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch!
oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
(entering) hey!
hey! how is it going? did you make any new friends?
yeah, yeah, i met this woman. (starts for his room.)
(stopping him) hey, whoa-whoa! what is she like?
uhh, well, she is…really good in bed.
joey, i thought you were going to try to be friends first!
(to rachel) well look, hey, it is all your fault!
what?! why?!
well because you did not give me advice! no! you gave me a pickup line! as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. i suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! (pause) and her roommate!
what about the closeness?
closeness-shmoshness! there was three of us for crying out loud!
(entering) all right! hey, who wants pizza?!
ooh, i do! i do! i do!
(taking a bite) oh, great! can you believe i found it on the second floor?
who is it?
uhh, just a minute officer!!
ooh, god, it is him! it is that cop! god, i can not believe it! he found me!
oh my god, phoebe, are you going to go to jail?!
well, if I am going down, I am taking you (points at all of them) with me. (they all look at her.) harboring a fugitive? that is one to three years minimum. good luck chandler. (she opens the door to the cop from before.) okay, you can arrest me. fine. but you will never make it stick and you know it!
yep! as long as you understand that I am going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he will make you look like a fool. a fool!
i would love it if i were not here!
me?!
wow! i did not see that coming! you are-you are asking me out!
umm, yeah, I would like to go out with you officer…
gary.
yeah! so--ooh, i got to ask you though. how did you know where to find me?
ohh, impressive.
yeah, we will talk at dinner.
all right, i can not wait!
(to rachel) he has a gun!
I would like to return this couch. I am not satisfied with it.
that is what I am telling you.
this couch, is cut in half! i would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
look, i am a reasonable man. i will accept store credit.
(thinks) i take it.
i cannot believe that you did not tell me that we are still married!!
look i was going to tell you!
when?! after the birth of our first secret child?! (to all) ross did not get the annulment; we are still married.
what?
you are kidding!
(overdoing it) oh my god!!
ross!
okay, maybe it was not my best decision. but i just could not face another failed marriage.
okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
rach, come on, if you think about it, it is actually kind of funny. (he laughs, and he laughs alone.) okay, maybe it is best not to think about it.
okay, this is inexcusable. i am shocked to my very core!
phoebe, i told her you already knew.
another lie. you have a sickness!
ross, just for my own piece of mind, you are not married to anymore of us are ya?
oh! hey, somebody left their keys. (looks at them) ooohh, to a porsche! {transcriber’s note: oh come on! who would leave the keys to their porsche behind? if i had a porsche, I would have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} hey gunther, these yours?
na-uh! (to everyone there) hey did anybody lose their keys?
joey, why do not you put them in the lost and found?
there is a lost and found? (gunther sets the box up on the table.) my shoe! (grabs it out of the box.)
you left a shoe here?!
well, i did not realize until i got home. i was not going to walk all the way back down here with one shoe! y’know what? I am going to go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. (goes to do so.)
oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I will be sure to give him your shoe.
great! thanks. (exits.)
(coming in from the bathroom) oh, good, good, you guys are here! listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
oh my god, what a fun day! that sounds great!
(not enthused) yeah, all right.
okay, well I will bring them by tomorrow morning. okay, and uh, by the way, they are not actually puppies, they are frank and alice’s triplets. okay, see ya! (exits.)
whoa-whoa-whoa! what?
(stops) please! please! please! please! oh please! please! please! frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I am nervous ‘because I have never done that before by myself!
do not worry about it phoebe, we will absolutely do it.
yeah, I am going to pass. ‘because i was kind of iffy when it was puppies.
come on chandler, come on! it will give us great practice for when—(realizes what she is about to say and changes)—people with babies come to visit.
yeah, it is not mine.
yeah, it is (looks up and sees the woman) mine.
me too! yeah. and comfortable. do uh, do you like leather seats?
(checks in the window to make sure it has them) it is got ‘them!
so, i still have boxes here. i still have boxes at ross’s, and i have nowhere to live! wow. i could so easily freak out right now.
what about me? i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while, i do not have a roommate.
well, maybe-maybe i could be your roommate pheebs.
maybe you could be my roommate!
well there is an idea!!
yeah!
that would be great! wait, how long is denise gone for?
umm, she said she would be back december 26th.
december 26th, huh maybe she is santa clause.
(deadpan) oh look who it is, my husband. the apple of my eye.
okay, i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and i picked up all the forms. I will take care of everything.
well sure, if you say you are going to take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you. give me those forms! (grabs them from him.) all right, now I am going to do this my way and i do not want to hear a peep out of you!
okay rach, but…
op! you are peeping!
ross! y’know what, i just got—why? why did you do this?!
look i told you…
i do not want to hear "three failed marriages!"
look, if you would had two failed marriages, you would understand!
well, y’know what? thanks to you I am half way there! ugh! oh! i am so mad! ross, i do not think i have ever been this angry!
what about the time i said we were on a break?
ugh! (stares at him.)
pheebs, how is it going?
(rapidly) I am doing okay. i think it is going well. do you think they are having fun? am i talking to fast?
nope, sound like me. pheebs, it is going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler.
little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben. (tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. it is times like these I am glad smell-of-vision has not been invented.) do you know what pheebs? when you are done over there, we kind of have a situation over here too. (phoebe is changing hers.)
na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
see that is where i think that you are wrong. we have been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
what do you mean?
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and y’know mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… (he degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)
that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
okay, I am a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.
this is so great! this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
yeah? (checking the final diaper) well this is not what i ordered.
(entering) hey guys!
hey!
hey!
hey babies! oh, I am having the best morning. that uh, that porsche I have got the keys too, still there!
shocking! since you still have the keys.
you should see the treatment i get when I am with that car! people are friendly; they-they want to talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
what equity investments?
the ones that got me the porsche! will you keep up! (chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. he drops it disgustedly.) but i figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they are going to start to think that i do not own it. so i figured I will wash it. right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow?
oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound.
you do not even have a car!
i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it.
and?
and six others.
there you are.
yeah, she tops out at 130.
and that is just in the city. i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate.
sure!
okay, take it easy.
really? oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.
oh i-i uh, found the keys and now I am just polishing her up.
yeah, but it is my wax.
sure. here. (he hands them over.) I will uh, save your parking spot.
why not?
yeah, so did i.
i do not know why i was so nervous about this. and i do not know why frank and alice are always complaining. this is so easy.
yeah, two hours, a lifetime that is the same.
(entering) check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog! (he holds up this xena-like warrior action figure.)
chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someone is eye out!
he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!
no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, that is just going to mess them up.
they are not going to swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
what?!
glass, sand, whatever. (walks out as monica and phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.
oh it is so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
oh, i can still do that.
how are you still single?!
(entering) all right. (clears throat) i thought about it and maybe you are right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.
good. what made you change your mind?
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
how did that happen?!!
well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y’know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it is lodged in my throat. (mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (he does it again.)
damnit! y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching chandler! (he does it again.)
yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
fine, I am mentally unstable.
what?!
uh yes, heroin and crack.
crack is not even an intravenous drug!
well, you would know.
oh, come on!
(starts to cry) ross, please, i found the magazines!
okay, I am sorry, this is insane! i-i-I am not addicted to heroin, I am not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, I will consummate this marriage right here, right now!
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
ugh!
ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! (to the stenographer) and could you strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record?
well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think.
(stands up) that is great! are you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form!
(stands up as well) what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
and what—(notices the stenographer is still typing)—what are you typing that for? did you hear what she said? we do not get the annulment. do not type that! what?! stop typing! (he goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes rachel out of his way.) hey! stop typing! (he is still typing.) stop typing! stop typing!!
(to the judge) okay, do you see, do you see what you are keeping me married too?!
all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one!
yeah!
and thank you for your time. (they both beat a hasty retreat.)
(entering wearing nothing but porsche clothes) so the porsche guy took his car back.
but you found the keys to his clothes?
no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.
and people will think you own a porsche because you are wearing the clothes?
of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you did not have the car! right?
that is true.
yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
oh, I have been there. yeah, i am going to go drive my porsche. (starts to leave.)
joey, you know you do not actually have one.
come on! what are you doing?! I am in character! would you talk to her! (storms out.)
ahh, i think it just moved. it is really poking me.
all right, that is it, we are going to the emergency room.
what?! no, you can not, you can not leave me here with them! we are baby-sitting!
the babies are asleep, I am sure you will be okay on your own for a while!
but you-you can not leave me with them! we-we are a team! we are playing a zone! they are going to triple team me!
he is got something plastic lodged in his throat, we have got to go to the hospital.
but no, because a doctor will not be able to help him, it is just going to y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
i think that is gum.
I am pretty sure it is gun.
okay, listen this really hurts. let us go.
a real man would not just run to the hospital! (they do not stop.) no! what would, what would krog do? (they ignore her and phoebe is left alone.)
why is not that valet back with my porsche?
(to women passing him) porsche.
this is totally your fault!
my fault?! you threatened the judge!
well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing!
hi! how are the gellers?
do not call us that! (storms away)
the judge would not let us get an annulment! now we got to get a divorce!! did a porsch throw up on you? (walks on.)
hey! it is porsche!! (he is right y’know.)
me taking care of you is no problem, huh? you guys feel safe. right? okay, I am going to take that spit bubble as, "yeah, i do!" okay, after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie, I will set you up with a clean one. (she throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) okay, I am sorry. i did not mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up. okay? ‘because let us face it, we are at monica’s. (she crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) i broke it. all right. well, that is just the way that goes. (she throws out both the flowers and the vase.) okay, good. (she turns around and only counts two babies.) why are there only two of you? where is leslie? well, you can not answer. (she starts looking for her) leslie? where are you leslie? leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (she turns around and finds that leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the tv cabinet.) well, look at you! hey! you are a little bit mischievous! my gosh! (she picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) oh, you are a lot mischievous! well, it will dry. (closes the drawer with her foot.) (to leslie) okay, you sit with your brother and sister now—who are not there! (they both have disappeared as well.)
(entering) hey!
(exhausted) how do you feel?
well, let us just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed ‘them, bathed ‘them, and put ‘them to bed.
and protected them from a tornado?
oh my god.
i know, the babies are asleep.
phoebe, what, what happened here?!
i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself!
but my apartment!
was the setting of phoebe’s triumph.
but the mess!
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
you are right, you are right i should not freak out. ‘because this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?!
(pause) phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
(deadpan) oh honey thank god you are home, i was getting worried.
i picked up the divorce papers. uh, I have already signed everything and i put little ‘x’s where you need to sign.
oh, little ‘x’s! great! that makes up for everything!
y’know, i-i—you have done a lot of stupid stuff too! okay?
oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding! ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married!
hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you!
yeah! right!
you are right. that is very different. so let us, let us just sign the papers. all right? (sits down and rachel keeps standing there.) what?
nothing. (sits down.)
okay, can we just sign please?
uh-hmm. (just as rachel finishes signing her name, ross yanks each page out of the way.)
congratulations. (gets up to leave.)
okay ross, we are—wait a minute. umm, i uh, i kind of have a little confession.
what?
well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kind of my idea.
excuse me?
well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
yeah?
and uh, yeah, i did not really, i did not want to say anything, but it kind of it just, it kind of kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then (ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. so umm, sorry i got us into this mess.
so then if-if—i mean if you think about it, this is all (pause.) your fault.
yeah, do not push it though.
I have got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you.
i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it would not be a secret, and we would not have our wedding dinner at pizza hut. (they both laugh.)
did i, did i even treat?
no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.
that may be the most depressing thing I have heard in my life. i should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
hey, thanks ross, for taking care of all of this.
eh, no problem.
I am going to need a copy of those.
totally. (exits.)
hey! hey! be careful around my porsche!
hey! how you doing?
I would love to show ya, but i just tucked her in. she is sleeping. (the women both laugh) hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. it turns out that joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a porsche.)
hey!! we are so in luck! treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. wait right there. (goes back into the hall)
oh no-no-no, I am, I am paddling away!
(returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) huh?!
wow! really?! we get all this rusty crap for free?!
uh-huh. this and a bunch of bubble wrap. and, some of it is not even popped!
could we be more white trash?
(entering from her bedroom) how desperate am i?
oh! good thing chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.
i just told my mom I would cater a party for her.
how come?
because i need the money, and i thought that it would be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
come on, i think this is a good thing. i do not think mom would have hired you if she did not think you were good at what you do.
you do not have to stick up for her. she can not here you.
(entering) hey! umm, do you guys have any juice?
just pickle.
hey uh, rach, funny story. i ah, bumped into joanna on the street yesterday.
my boss, joanna? wow, that must have been awkward.
well, no, actually she uh, asked me if i wanted to get a drink.
(laughs) you ah, you did not say ‘yes’ to that did you?
(laughs) no. no!
well, not at first.
what is she doing here?
i do not understand! last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’
well, i think i judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
well, last time i almost got fired. you must end it, you must end it now!
oh, come on! it is not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! i mean usually I am pretty much just in there by myself.
chandler!! (he turns around quickly) promise me, you will end it.
okay, i promise, I will end it.
thank you.
i hope you know what I am giving up for ya, because she is not just the boss in your office, if you know what i mean.
yeah-eh-eah! (rachel glares at him) oh-oh, sorry, i-i knew what he meant.
doing great, the quiches are coming along.
yeah, i thought it was cute.
let me ask you a question.
why did you hire me?
(to phoebe) oh my god! did you hear that? she hired me because she thinks I am good.
okay, i did not hear that.
oh yeah, she did not hire me out of pity, it was not so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I am good.
wow! and hey, it is cool if you are a lesbian! (gives her a thumbs up)
uhhhh. (he is not sure)
no! no. but ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
…I am telling you it is totally unconstituional.
…i think he deserves a nobel prize. (joey starts to nod ‘yes.’)
…it was like the algonquin kids table. (they all laugh, but joey only laughs not to be left out.)
yeah-well-yeah! yeah-oh-yeah. come on in.
that is weird.
what?
your nails.
oh, i know, i never wear fake ones. i just did it so my mom would not give me grief about me biting them.
oh, no, i meant that it is weird that you only have nine now.
(looks at her nails) oh my god. wait a minute, i had them put… (realises) oh my god! it is in the quiche! oh my god!
okay, do not panic. I am going to go to the store, I am going to get you another set of nails, no one’s going to know, and you are going to look great. (she runs over to get her coat.) oh! oh, it is ‘because they are going to eat—that is the problem.
okay ah, please do not freak out. umm, but ah, there is a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there is no way to know which one.
and! whoever finds it wins the prize!
then why are you laughing?
what? you bet I would lose a nail?
frozen lasagnas?
you bet that I would screw up?! so all that stuff about hiring me because i was good was…
you promised dr. weinburg, you would never use that phrase.
(laughs) that is right. my mom does not have any faith in me! oh, that is hilarious! ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
i do not get it.
(interrupting) no! you have lasagnas! (storms out and an awkward silence follows.)
op, the ruined quiches are ready.
it just does not…feel like we are breaking up.
okay.
thanks.
okay. (starts to button up his shirt)
I am getting dressed.
when i walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
what is it?
ah-ha, you are not the boss of me. (she kisses him) yeah, you are! (she handcuffs him to the chair) ooh, saucy.
you are, you are going to leave me like this?
okay. but if you do not come back soon, (she leaves and closes the door) there is pretty much nothing i can do about it!
that is weird, she locked the door.
okay, swear you will not tell, but when mark left he gave me a key to joanna’s office. do you want to see the list?
hi! (to sophie) how are you?
hello, joanna…(realises he does not know her last name)…’s office.
how little?!
look, this is not funny! you get back here right now!
why not?!
what?!
(answering it) (angrily) what?!
(in a serious, businesslike tone) rachel, could i see you for a moment?
okay, here is the situation. the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? and on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
you promised you would break up with her!
i did break up with her! she just took it really, really well!
and the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
it did enter my mind! but then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
y'know what chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
no-no-no-no-no-no-no!! i can not get myself right out of them! you must have me confused with the amazing chandler!! come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I am cold, and (stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind joanna’s desk.)
oh, chandler!! all right, this is it! (grabs the key) you never see joanna again!
never!
you never come into this office again!
fine!
you give me back my walkman!
i—never borrowed your walkman.
well, then i lost it. you buy me one!
you got it! here we go! come on! this is great! (rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) ahhh! (he starts rubbing his wrist)
does it hurt?
no, i just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (he runs over to where his pants are hanging) hello sweet pants!
wait a minute! what are you going to tell joanna?
about what?
when she sees that you are gone, she is going to know that i let you out, and that i was in here, and I am going to get fired!
I will make something up! I am good at lying, i actually did borrow your walkman!
no, there is nothing to make up, she is going to know that i have a key to her office, I have got to get you locked up back the way you were! (she tries to drag him over to the chair, but chandler stops her.)
oh-ho-ho, i do not think so!
well, this is much better.
he cut off his ear.
I am out.
wow! that is pretty nice. i thought he cut off his ear ‘because he sucked. what else you got in there?
in the woods. no wait-wait, that is the joke answer.
spock’s birth control.
hey!
hi.
this used to be your room? (she nods ‘yes’) wow! you must have been in really good shape as a kid.
ohh, I am such an idiot. i can not believe i actually thought she could change.
well, who cares what your mom thinks? so you pulled a monica.
oh good, I am glad that is catching on.
no but, why does that have to be a bad thing. just change what it means. y'know? go down there and prove your mother wrong. finish the job you were hired to do, and we will call that pulling a monica.
what?
okay, umm, if a kid gets straight a’s, his parents would say, "yeah, he pulled a monica." y'know? or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "yeah i know, he pulled a monica." or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "yeah, that one’s outta here." though some things do not change.
(getting up) all right, I will go down there. but, I am not going to serve the lasagna. I am going to serve something i make.
wow! my breasts are really strong. (she goes and joins monica.)
chandler! chandler, please, i have to get you locked up back the way you were, i am sooo going to lose my job, she is very private about her office. now i know why.
hey, look, you are in trouble either way! okay? if she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she is going to know you were in here. so you might as well just let me go.
what if i clean your bathroom for a month?
it still would not be clean. (rachel makes an ‘eww, disgusting!’ face) all i want is my freedom.
foot rubs for a month!
freedom!
I will take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
freedom! i want my freedom! why will not you here me?! (opens the door) sophie, help me! help me!! (sophie stands up)
sophie sit!!
no! god, would you just calm down!
I am going to say this for the last time. would you please just… (he moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)
wow! there is a lot i did not know about vomit. (the duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (to the duck) in a minute. (the duck goes back into the bathroom.)
twelve hundred dollars? you think i have $1200? I am home in the middle of the day, and i got patio furniture in my living room. i guess there is a few things you do not get from book learnin’.
how about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
you want to see what i got? (he gets up to empty out his pockets) okay? I have got a baby tootsie roll, a movie stub, keys, a kleenex, a rock, and an army man. hey!
and a 50. (the salesman stops suddenly) huh, these must be chandler’s pants.
oh, i-i think I am going to stick with the v, i want to see how this bad boy turns out.
i ah, will buy and wrap all of your christmas gifts.
no!
i ah… oh! I will squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
with extra pulp?
(happily) yeah!!
no!
d’oh!! (pause) I have got it!
you do not have it.
i have so got it. there is going to be rumours about this, there is no way to stop it. sophie knows, monica and phoebe know.
how do monica and phoebe know?
oh, i called them. and when they ask me what i saw, i can be very generous (holds her hands far apart) or very (in a high pitched voice) stingy.
(intrigued) go on.
i can make you a legend. i can make you this generation’s milton berle.
and milton berle has a…
ohh, not compared to you. (chandler nods in agreement)
well?
they are not even touching the lasagna!
really?!
oh, they love your casserole.
yes!!
it is hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
and you?
so if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. which would make you…
well, i was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
wow!
umm, you might even say that she pulled a monica. (they both look at her) (to monica) she does not know we switched it. (monica nods her head ‘no.’)
that really means a lot. oh, and mom, do not bite your nails.
(hello) hello.
(in a sexy voice) hello, chandler. (phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)
(to rachel) i love you. (kisses her on the forehead)
wh-what is going on?
oh.
no he does not!
(checks his watch) two hours, that lasted!
so did you break up with joanna?
i think so.
well, it is good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that vesuvius.
the volcano?
yeah. and speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
what?!
oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
well, we can talk about something else. what do you want to talk about? vivisection? the vasdeferens? the vietnam war?
oh! did anybody see that-that documentary on the korean war? (joey is pissed)
oh god, korea is such a beautiful country.
with such a sad history.
could there be more kims?
it is me! good morning!
yeah, sure. umm, they did not have poppy seed bagels, so i… (enters joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) oh my word!
oh, yeah! yeah!
okay.
(coming from the bathroom) hey pheebs?
huh?
I am having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you want to come?
sure. yeah, he is kind of sexy.
oh no, no, I will be there too.
okay so, we will just come up with some kind of signal if it is going well you can take off.
no phoebe! i just need you there for support. i have not told him I am pregnant yet.
oh. why not?
‘because i know he is going to flip out and i hate it when he is angry.
oh rachel, this is all so ‘papa do not preach.’
what phoebe? wait! one time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he would make me eat the entire pack.
wow! oh well, i will be there!
thank you.
gosh. I am not going to let that man make you eat your baby. (they both sit down by the rest of the gang and phoebe recognizes a man by the window.) oh. hey! who is that guy? i think i know him.
(recognizing him and panicking) no you do not!
(panicking) no you do not.
oh my god!!! monica!! he is the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
her what?!!
your secret bachelorette party…
you had a bachelorette party?!
she untied his g-string with her teeth. (pause) somebody stop me!
i thought we were not going to have bachelor/bachelorette parties! y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
it is a grand tradition!
I am sorry, they surprised me. there was nothing i could do!
well you could have untied it with your hands.
this is so unfair! the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, i was not allowed to. all i got was a stupid steak dinner!
you went home with the waitress.
oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
i can not believe you did not tell me! you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
ugh, i knew giving you that book was going to come back and bite me in the ass!
oh, i-i do not eat meat.
yeah, i do not eat that either.
well actually umm…
(to phoebe) in case you did not notice, that is a scary man.
he is right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.
this was such a huge mistake. i can not tell him phoebe. i can not, i can not, i can not, i can not…
rachel!
no it is okay, this is what is going to happen. I am going to wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
why, so he can get mad at the baby?
hey, that is the…baby’s problem. (dr. green returns.) oh, everything okay with the waiter?
well… umm, i got tivo.
it is slang for pregnant.
phoebe!
well uh, yes and no. except not no. so to sum it up, yeah.
no, it is ross. it is ross. you like ross. (he just shakes his head.) oh daddy, i hope you are okay with all of this. i mean think about it, this is a good thing. you are going to—this is your first grandchild! you are going to be a poppy!
yeah.
who?
february 2nd!
oh thanks. although it kind of seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
yeah, a lot of my students do that.
okay, i-I will see you tonight.
okay, bye.
my god! you must be good in bed!
so uh, you and mona, been a while now. how is it going?
ah, it is good. it is going good. i mean, we get along great. she is, she is so…
hot?
well, i was going to say sweet, but yeah-huh!
she is okay with rachel and the baby?
well i…i have not actually told her yet. i do not want to scare her off, y’know?
well, you have to honest with her! otherwise you may think that you are going down the same path, but you are really going down different ones.
I am going to take that book and beat you to death with it.
(entering) oh my god! you are going to love me so much! i felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you are going to have a bachelor party.
what?
yeah, i got this number from this guy at work and i hired a stripper to come dance for you. am i going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
honey! that is crazy! i do not want you to get me a stripper…
will you let the lady talk?!
come on! come on, it will be fun! it will make me feel so much better.
look, i appreciate it, but uh, it is a little creepy. y’know? I am not a bachelor anymore.
so do not think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.
sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance! (joey nods his agreement.)
please! i feel so bad! just watch the hot woman get naked!
all right fine! but I am only doing this for you!
yeah!
and joey.
thank you. all right, now who else do you want to invite?
ah, no-no-no just ross. ross and joey is embarrassing enough.
uh actually, sorry i can not even make it. I am seeing mona again tonight.
i understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
(on cell phone) I am sorry i got to cancel tonight baby…
I am sorry i will not be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I am really busy that day. yeah, i already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
i know. i know. i panicked, i panicked. i did not want him to start yelling at me like i was some ’74 latour.
it is lafite. the ’74 latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
all right here he comes. I am going to do this, I am going to tell him, I am going to be strong.
yeah?
really?! the plaza?!! oh daddy!! (hugs him and phoebe glares at her.) right. daddy, i need to talk to you. please, sit down.
there is not going to be a wedding. ross and i are not getting married.
I am sorry daddy.
oh now daddy, stay calm. please.
yes. yes, he says I am damaged goods.
so you uh, nervous about getting married?
what are you doing?
look, look let us pretend it is a real bachelor party. okay? y’know? before your wedding. come on, it will be fun.
okay. i can not believe tomorrow’s the big day.
how does it feel knowing you are never going to be with another woman again huh? knowing you are going to have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
you are right, this is more fun.
that is her! okay, come on! (they go over and open the door.)
hi. (joey blows on a noisemaker.)
uh, that-that is-that is me!
that is me.
joey tribbiani, a big fan.
yeah, yeah right over there.
that was weird.
why-why would she go in the bedroom?
so she is a…
yeah, that is one naked hooker!
uh that is an eighteenth century indian artifact from calcutta.
so much more.
aw forget it, it is from pier one. (there is an angry knock on the door.) sorry. (goes and opens the door to an irate dr. green.)
y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
who did?!
yes. yes, yes i did. (to mona) but-but it was, it was just a one night thing. it meant nothing.
no! no sir umm, she means a lot to me. i mean, i care—i-i love rachel.
(to mona) oh but not that way. i mean…i mean I am not in love with her. i love her like a, like a friend.
(to dr. green) hey! i offered to marry her!
(to mona) but i did not want to.
I am sorry. dr. green, mona. mona, dr. green.
i can not believe there is a naked hooker in there!
wait! wait! maybe she is a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she is supposed to do.
could be. i mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (walks towards the bedroom.) madam, are you also a stripper?
maybe monica’s playing a joke on ya. y’know? getting her own husband a hooker, that is pretty funny.
that is funny, maybe for my birthday she will murder someone.
i bet ross was in on it too. i mean he was conveniently busy.
oh actually, I would rather you…yeah, go ahead. we are going to have to burn that room down anyway.
i was going to tell you, but…
hey! i did not dump rachel! (to mona) nor are we still together. (the phone rings and ross goes to answer it, only he is trapped behind the apothecary table by dr. green.) can i just… (dr. green glares at him.) why do not we just let the machine get that?
(on machine) hey ross. it is joey. there is a hooker over here and we thought maybe you would know something about it.
no! no! no! no! no! i-i-i-i—i need to, i need to lie down.
yeah! hey! thanks for getting me that girl’s number.
my husband.
she is a stripper.
is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
oh my god stu! i-i can not believe you did this! now are you absolutely sure she is a hooker?
maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
why would she do that?
maybe she wants you to learn something. huh? now is there anything you are really bad at y’know, sexually?
this is the worst bachelor party ever!
in a minute!
(to joey) in a minute? what is going to happen in a minute?!
all right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
why me?!
hey! it is your bachelor party.
which is why you should do it.
i do not want to. you do it!
you do it!
you do it!
all right rock, paper, scissors who has to tell the who are to leave! (joey smirks.) what?
i miss this.
i do not think we have actually done this before!
no, i-i miss hanging out with you.
well we…we still hang out.
not like we used to. remember? you and me used to be inseparable. y’know now it is like…things are different.
well y’know, things are different. I am…I am married now.
oh sure—and hey, do not get me wrong, i am so happy for you guys. i just…i miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?
yeah, i miss that too. i tell you what; from now on we will make time to hang out with each other.
you got it. come here. (they hug and are observed by the hooker.)
(entering quickly) she is a hooker! she is a hooker! she is a… (stops as she sees her.) hi! uh, we spoke on the phone. (goes and shakes the hooker’s hand.)
so your dad dropped by. he is a pleasant man!
(quietly) oh no…
I would better go. (she goes and sits down in the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000, the chair that sit magazine called chair of the year, and they both look at her.) just over here: i do not want to miss the fight.
ross I am so sorry. okay. i-i will promise i will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
i do not care about your dad! i care about mona! she was there and now she is totally freaked out!
oh okay, I will fix that to. what is her e-mail address?
rachel!
all right, i promise. I will fix this. i swear. I will-I will-I will-I will talk to her.
okay!
okay.
thank you!
that is it?! you call that a fight? come on! "we were on a break!" "no we were not!" what happened to you two?!
thank you so much for coming back over.
i know mona, just hear me out. first of all, I am so sorry about my father yelling at you, but i heard you totally held your own. you are going to have to tell me how you did that.
focus.
okay. um…but—okay, yes ross and i used to date. and yes we are going to have a baby. but we are definitely not getting back together.
oh we just—we drove each other crazy!
yeah.
i mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
trying to date this woman.
right! but, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. (rubbing his shoulder.)
probably should not touch me.
i know, i get it, but mona, what relationship is not complicated? i mean we all have our baggage! you must too! why else would you still be single? (mona looks at her.) i am so going to leave right now. (ross opens the door for her and she leaves.)
should i leave this open for you too?
because what is going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you.
i know and i was going to, but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachel’s father. look i…i made a mistake, but it is only because i really, really like you. really!
(entering) forgot my purse! (sees them kissing.) oh, you guys made up. (to mona) he is a good kisser is not he? (ross goes to close the door on her.) I am going! (quickly leaves and ross locks the door.)
i swear i did not know she was a hooker! i mean wh—did you let her smoke in here?
her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
y’know what? I am going to make this up to you. i promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and you are going to get a stripper. (she starts to strip.)
monica! wait!
what?
(puts on his crown) carry on.
ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. i think I will take them off. (goes to do so.)
could you not narrate?
gotcha sailor. (kicks one of her shoes off and it lands in the kitchen knocking something down, but she continues to strip.)
(entering, quietly) wow, you told your dad the truth.
about an hour ago.
want to go see a movie?
yes! (she gets up and sets the phone on the counter without hanging it up.) bye daddy. (phoebe and her leave.)
(on phone) hey! i do too think about the consequences of my decisions! (listens) what gives you the right to… (listens) go to hell! (hangs up the phone and opens the fridge.) stupid guy on my phone.
hey!
hey!
wow! you look nice. what is the occasion?
monica and i are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we have got reservations at ja george.
wow! how did you get in there?
made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and did not get desert.
hey caitlin! somebody got a haircut.
yeah, if that was true, gym class would have been a lot more interesting.
oh, okay. (hands her the money.) here you go.
oh, he is in the back. the duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
okay, bye!
what the hell was that?!
what?
the flirting! are not you supposed to be going out with, i do not know hmm, let us say my sister?!
i was not flirting.
it was totally flirting. "somebody got a haircut (makes some whiney, nasally noises.)"
okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. and second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. that is all.
yeah, right.
you want to see flirting? I will show you flirting. (starts to move towards ross.)
(backing away) I am good.
i am so proud of joey, i can not believe he is going to be on law & order!
i know. but do not you think that it should be called order and law?
no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
do not get me started on that.
i was not flirting.
and on your anniversary, for shame!
what is going on?
chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
i was not and oh god, shh!
well I am sorry but you were! okay? and besides if anyone should be hitting on her it is the guy who is single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
sounds like somebody wants to be mr. pizza delivery girl.
well…
is that what this is about? you like caitlin?
ross! we broke up two years ago; you have been married since then. i think it is okay that we see other people.
well, i-i was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
hm-mmm.
and she is just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
okay, y'know what? we do not need her measurements.
(looking through the pizzas) okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay ross, i know she is pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! she forgot my vegetarian!
this is perfect! she will have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I will turn on the charm-of-ross. oh I am so glad you do not eat meat.
see? vegetarianism benefits everyone.
(entering, with his grandmother) hey everybody, look who is here! you remember my grandmother!
big night!
this is so cool!
so, joey on law & order, you must be very proud!
chandler, she does not understand a word of english.
I am sorry, i thought you were joey's other grandmother. (she just stares at him.) I have done it again.
she is my biggest fan. yeah, she is the only one in the family that is believed in me.
yeah, i uh weighted like 27 pounds when i was born so…
(entering from the bathroom) hey! happy anniversary!
happy anniversary, 10 months! (they kiss.)
so umm, when i was in the shower i was thinking about our first night in london…
uhh, joey's grandmother is right there. (points)
is that the one that speaks english or the one that does not?
the one that does not.
that was some hot love you gave me! I am going to go get ready.
hey, why do not you wear those earrings i gave you?
that is a great idea! i was saving them for something special.
okay.
(runs over to phoebe) you have got to go home!
but i like it here!
you got to go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
okay, well i think that they are in my purse. why do not you go get dressed and I will look for them.
great!
okay! (walks over to rachel) rach, hi, i need those earrings you borrowed.
oh, umm, okay, yeah, I will be, yeah I will be right back. (goes to her room.)
wow pheebs, you speak italian?
i guess so. (see, the brief possession did not affect her at all, like we could really tell.)
(she enters and hands phoebe the earring) here you go. thank you!
wait, rach! where is the other one?
oh what, you-you want both of them?
rachel karen green, where is the other earring?!
okay, okay, okay, look, just do not freak out, but i kind of lost it. i know it is in the apartment, but i definitely lost it.
well, what am i going to tell monica? she wants to wear them tonight!
tell her to wear her own earrings.
these are her earrings.
nooo! nooooo! you lent me monica's earrings?! I am not allowed to borrow her stuff!
why not?
because i lose her stuff!
okay, see that blind guy right there? I am going to bash his head in later.
oh umm, my big scene is coming up. big scene coming up.
if you said, "big lima bean, bubbling up." would she understand the difference?
(noticing rachel crawling behind the couch) rach? what are you doing?
oh boy, i just can not watch. it is too scary!
it is a diaper commercial.
oh yeah well, you know me, babies, responsibilities, ahhh!!!
I will get it! i will get that! (runs over and opens the door.)
hi!
oh. uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better. i happen to like 8-year-old boys.
(i can not make it out.) the uh, your hair, before, your hair, you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's, and I am just saying i like it. the hair.
you understand i do not actually like 8-year-old boys.
here you go. (hands her the money.) now stop bringing us pizzas you.
you are welcome.
you could not let me have her, could ya?!
what?
this is a girl that i really like and had too swoop in there!
what is going on?
chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
thank you for that! (to monica) i was not flirting.
it is okay. i do not care. it is uh, it is fine.
really?!
really?!
it is no big deal, i do it all the time.
(starts to laugh, but then gets serious) so umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
sure! it does not mean anything! just like i know it does not mean anything with you!
okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than i am.
(walking past) true story! (goes and sits down.)
chandler, this actually bothers you?
yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. rachel, when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
and thank you, for that.
but y'know, i never really had anything to worry about. ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
what? (mumbles) what-what, what are talking about? it-it worked with you.
oh! y'know what? you are right! we meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
all right, all right. you-you-you know what I am going to do? i am going to order another pizza and when caitlin gets here, you-you--i will show how well i flirt. yeah! i will, i will get her phone number! (to chandler) and not the one on the menu!
(entering from rachel's bedroom) i found it!
ohh! thank god! where was it?
on your dresser.
okay that is the one we already have!
okay, here is my big scene. my big scene's here! (they have two of the cops on the street, then they cut to where they are entering an apartment.) oh my god.
what?
(smiling) okay, everybody just keep smiling. it will kill my grandmother if she finds out.
(smiling) well, what is it?
(smiling) oh, they cut me out of the show.
(smiling) what?!
(smiling) are you sure?
(smiling) maybe your scene's coming up?
(smiling) not likely.  because you see that body bag right there
(smiling) yeah.
(smiling) I am in it.
(smiling) this is terrible, what are you going to do?
(smiling) i do not know. this little, old lady lives for my career. when they dumped me off of days of our lives she almost died.
(not smiling) that is not good.
(smiling) no, smile! not that face, smile! everybody smile! (they all smile.)
(smiling) joey, why do not you just tell her what happened? it is not your fault.
(smiling) if we keep talking this way, are not we going to freak her out soon?
soon, soon, I am going to be on soon. there i am! (points to the screen, of course it is not him.)
no-no-no, that-that is me, that is me.
does not know, "hello." but she knows capricorn one.
(following her) phoebe! i have to have those earrings, we are going to leave as soon as the show is over.
but i already gave them back to you!
no you did not.
all right, i already did not give them back to you, that is what i said. (walks away over to rachel.) where is that other earring?
it is not here pheebs, it is not here. ohh, i went to joey and chandler's last night! okay! (goes to the door.)
make sure you check chandler's jewelry box.
wait a minute. chandler has a jewelry box?
okay, we have like ten minutes. do you want me to get into that now?!
(to phoebe) hey pheebs! how is that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? you and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
(she just looks at him) why are you being weird?
do you like it?
no, that would be, "why are you being cute?"
okay, I am working on my flirting.
ohh! i did not get that.
so uh monica, do you, do you like the law & order?
yeah, it is good.
see, I am finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area!
chandler! (joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) okay, let me get this straight, it is okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
oh, I am so glad we cleared that up. look, I am sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
go on, teach me something about men and women.
okay, I have already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, "I am just flirting, no big deal." but the guy is thinking, "finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!"
no way!
it is true.
well that is pathetic!
again true.
and this goes for all guys?
all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
(to ross in the kitchen) all right, it is another commercial; i still have not told her!
joey! this is like the last commercial. you have got like (checks his watch) ten minutes left!
i know, i know! what am i going to do? (thinks) ooh!
no! you are not going to run out and leave her here!
(dejected) yeah, all right. (thinks of something.) ooh! (he quickly runs out before anyone can stop him.)
uh, joey is going to be right back. right back! (tries to pantomime it for her.) meanwhile, let us-let us-let us talk about you. (pause.) so, you are old and small.
(entering) (to phoebe) (whispering) hey!
did you find it?
the earring? no. but look, i found my sunglasses under the couch! I have been looking for these since like last summer. (puts  them on.)
okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
okay, calm down, here they are. (gives back the sunglasses.)
(entering from her room) phoebe! (motions for the earrings. phoebe gives her the one-minute sign.)
(to rachel) what are we going to do?!
i do not know, i do not know.
all right well, we are just going to have to tell monica, that is all.
oh gosh, she is going to kill me.
i suppose i could tell her it is just all my fault.
ohh that would be great!
mon, can i talk to you for a sec?
yeah, what is it?
umm, i lost one of your earrings. I am sorry! i am so, so sorry!
(shocked) wow! all right well, i mean, what can you do? if you lost it you lost it.
i will replace it, i promise. i feel so terrible.
all right, sweetie that is fine. you did not do it on purpose.
no.
look at you! come here! (they hug.) feel better?
yeah! you are the best!
okay, wait a minute. wait a minute, i-i-i, i can not do this. listen honey, this is, it is not phoebe's fault. she lent me the earrings, and i lost it. I am so sorry. honey, i feel terrible too. (holds out her arms for a hug.)
(angrily) that is exactly why i do not lend you stuff!! (rachel looks over at phoebe in resignation.) okay?! i mean, first it is my jewelry! and if it is not my jewelry, it is-it is my blue sweater! and if it is not my sweater, it is my sunglasses!
your sunglasses?!
yes!
oh, right! (hands monica back her sunglasses.)
(running to the door) oh, mine! mine! mine! (to everyone) okay, here goes. prepare yourselves for some class a flirting.
okay, hold on. (pauses as he readies himself.) okay. (walks away.)
honey, you have nothing to prove. and if you really like this girl, i do not flirting is the right thing to… (ross interrupts and shushes her.)
you will see. okay. (readies himself.) oh, what is-what is her name?
(he opens the door while faking a laugh.) hey! oh, we-we can not keep eating like this. (monica turns her head in shame.)
okay, (gets the money) so, do you make the pizzas in one of those uh, wood-burning ovens?
gas? wow! intense.
(to monica) if this is the way all the gellers flirt, we do not have a problem.
(to caitlin) hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?
they put that in.
the gas is odorless, but they add the smell so you know when there is a leak.
a lot of other gas smells…
oh the humanity.
meth-methane smells…
oh but i-i-i have not paid you yet!
(to all) was i talking to her about gas?
more so than anything else.
i-i-i found it interesting.
I am sorry.
look, no-no, hey, hey, do not worry about it! in nine years, she and i will be right there. (goes and sits on the couch dejectedly.)
okay, well, I am going to clear out some of these boxes. (she grabs a couple of the old pizza boxes and exits.)
(walking over to ross) ross?
yeah?
what else do they add smell too?
hey! hey! (stops caitlin) hi! hey-hey-hey, I am rachel! from upstairs? the ones with all the pizza?
no. no. every thing's--they are fine. great pizza. but it is uh, actually umm my friend ross. he uh, just gets really nervous when he is flirting.
yeah.
i know, i know, but uh just, I am telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you want to die, he is-he is really a good person.
yeah. I am-I am telling you he is really sweet and he is really funny and he is just ugh, got a good heart. and besides, i y'know, i think he really likes you.
well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?
(entering) hey ross? umm, i just ran into caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than i thought.
what do you mean?
well, i do not get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number. (hands him the slip of paper with the phone number on it.)
and she just gave you this?
yeah!
rach, thanks but uh, i do not need you doing me any favors.
i-i-i did not! i did not! she thought you were cute.
well that i can believe.
yay!
(entering) hey! is the show still on?
almost over man.
(says hi to his grandma) look! oh! (pointing out the window.) is that the pope?! (chandler and his grandma turn to look and joey slips a tape into the vcr.)
why am i looking?
oh, here i am, here is my big scene!
(on the tape) all right back off! i got to gun! I am not afraid to use it!
that is right!
you could not have at least changed your shirt.
(on the tape) now, i want to a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. (the duck quacks, to the duck) choo! choo! choo! (to the imaginary cops) filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if i do not get it…(the duck quacks louder) choo!! and if i do not get it, (pause, picks up the duck) I am going to shoot this duck!
oh no!
(on the tape) I am comin' out! (he opens the door and hops out pointing the gun in all directions and then runs out of view.)
(to phoebe) and she is supposed to buy this?!
(singing) ground control to major tom! commencing countdown…engines…on!
(to his grandmother) that is uh, scenes from next week's show. next week's!
i am definitely going to watch that!
what about these? these look the same?
definitely!
not as each other!
oh, then no.
(to monica) hey!
hi!
you ready?
yeah.
you look amazing. I am the luckiest man in the world.
ohh, you are about to get a little luckier.
let me see the earrings.
oh, honey, the earrings…
(looking at them) they look great! does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
my boyfriend really does have good taste!
(to ross) thanks for picking out the earrings man.
hm-mmm.
here you go pheebs. who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
i will have one. (ross and him both take one.)
okay, I am not going to have one.
neither will i. (they both put back the brownies.)
no, no, it is just my tooth.
all right I will have one. (he and ross take another brownie,)
so what is a matter, you need a dentist? I have got a good one.
no thanks, i have a good one too. i just, i, i can not see him.
see that is the problem with invisible dentists.
why? why can not you go to him?
because, every time i go to the dentist, somebody dies.
that is so weird, because every time i go to the dentist, i look down the hygienist’s blouse.
phoebe, what? umm...what?!
yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt mary, and then there was umm, john, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘albino bob’.
and all these people actually died?
yes, while i was in the chair! that is why i take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it is not about oral hygiene, i floss to save lives!
pheebs, come on, you did not kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. it is, it is, it is just ah, a coincidence.
well tell that to them. oh! you can not, their dead.
thanks, gunther. (takes the plate gunther serves him and rachel comes up and kisses him) (to rachel) hey! (to gunther) umm, can i get a napkin too?
(trying to bite into an apple) ow! ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
all right, fine, fine, but if you are my next victim, do not come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the tv set.
i promise.
although, do not feel like you can not visit.
(entering with monica) hey, is, is, is chandler here?
(patting his clothes like he is looking for his wallet) no, no he is not.
you guys, joey just saw janice kissing her ex-husband.
what? (to joey) so what are you going to do? i mean how, how are you going to tell chandler?
well, i was thinking about that and i, i think the best way would be, to not.
joey, you can not keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
it will kill him. i mean it will, it will just kill him.
well, you could wait ‘til i go to the dentist, maybe I will kill him.
(looking out the window) ewww! ugly naked guy is using his new hammock. it is like a play-doo fat factory.
well, I am going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... all right, just look out! okay, and um, i also just want to, i just want to tell you all that um...... (starts to cry and runs out)
okay, i have a problem i have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the homo sapien display.
what did they do?
well, they painted over the word ‘sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let us just leave it at that.
so, do you want me to watch ben for you?
yes, that is what i was going to ask, thank you.
whoa! wait! hello! what about me?
you? you! want to watch ben? (in the background monica mouths ‘do not worry, I will be here the whole time.’ to ross.) yes! that would be great, no, i just wanted to ask monica, because i know how empty her life is. (monica sarcastically mouths ‘yeah!’ and holds up her thumb.)
hey-hey, ross?
yeah.
I have got a science question.
hmm?
if the homo sapiens, were in fact ‘homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?
joey, homo sapiens are people.
hey-hey, I am not judging.
(holding ben) look benny, spoon. (moves it back and forth) spoon. come on! all right, y'know what i think he is bored.
here. ben, do you want to play the airplane game, do you want to show rachel? come here. (takes ben) we are going to do something fun. okay. (throws ben up in the air a little bit and catches him) weee!! (moves into the living room and does it again) weee!! (starts to walk back into the kitchen as she does it again, and hits ben’s head on that wooden beam across the ceiling.)
(to ben) who is so brave, you are so brave, yes you are, you are so brave.
okay. okay honey, he is fine, he is fine, let us just put him down. come here, ben. (sets him on the couch) see that is a good boy. (to monica) how could you do that to him!! ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
he is not going to say anything, because we are not going to tell him.
we are not?!
no we are not.
all right, i like that.
okay.
so we are okay, we are okay, we are okay, (starts to exam ben) are not we? no, we are not okay, we are not okay, there is a bump, there is a bump.
oh my god! well push it in! push it in!
i cannot push it in!
okay, we are going to need a distraction.
okay, okay, okay.
i got it!
okay.
the second that ross walks in that door, i want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
or. we could put a hat on his head.
a hat! yes! we need a hat.
we need a hat..
where are we going to find a tiny little hat?
oh, oh, oh, I will get ‘rainy day bear’!! (runs to get him)
because he will know what to do? (rachel comes out of her room with a bear that is dressed in a rain suit.) oh my god, you are a genius!
oh god, oh god, it is sowed on though.
give it. give it.
okay.
oh, it is just like a bloodbath in here today.
hey! hold on a minute, hold on a second. do you think these pearls are nice?
I would really prefer a mountain bike.
janice’s birthday is coming up, i want to get her something speacial. come in here with me.
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
that is a good idea, ‘dear janice have a hubba-bubba birthday’. i would like to get her something serious.
oh, you want something serious. y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. those are dead serious.
all right. look, I am going to go in here, and you do not buy me anything ever. (starts to go into the store)
(stopping him) no, no, you can not, you can not, okay, you can not, you can not buy her pearls, you just can not, you can not, you can not.
why not?!
oh god. uh, okay, here is the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
what is the thing?
okay. i went down to the ‘mattress king’ showroom and, and i saw janice, kissing her ex-husband.
(shocked) what?
they were in his office.
well she, she would not do that, she is with, she is with me.
I am telling you man, i saw it.
yeah, well, you are wrong! okay, you are wrong.
I am not wrong! i wish i was. I am sorry. bet that barium enema does not sound so bad now, huh?
it just makes more sense as an ensemble.
right.
besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
(running through the door) no! oh! you are alive! you are alive!
see pheebs, i promised you no one would die, did not i?
yeah, well, we will see about that. can i use your phone? i just want to call everyone i know.
sure, we have no money, go ahead.
(on phone) ‘hey! you are not dead! okay, see ya!’
oh my god! he just said my name! did you hear that?
okay, i heard that.
did he just say ‘monica bang’?
uh-huh.
oh my god! he is going to rat me out!
oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you got to stop saying that, now. it is no big deal, it is not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. see watch this, ben, ben, ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) ow, monica bang! (does it again) everybody bang. (repeats) ben bang. (repeats) rachel bang. (repeats) bang, rachel bang! oh, is not that fun?
(goes over and hits her head on the post) look at that! (repeats) look at that! (repeats) we all do it. (repeats) okay, I am stopping now.
you okay?
oh yeah! y'know, if it is not a headboard, it is just not worth it.
ah, i do not know, you tell me. anything you ah, want to tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
you tell me! maybe, it is because i was just fooling with my ex! oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
all right!
joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
no! in his office! how many kisses were there?
wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? there should be no kissing!!
(giving her a bag) here.
I will take it! all right look, i got to know. are you finished with me? (janice shakes her head no) are you finished with him? (janice shakes her head no) do you still love him? (janice shakes her head yes) do you still love me? (janice shakes her head yes) all right look, (grabs the bag) I am going to need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)
(rushing in) okay. if you are alive you answer your phone!
okay, ben, i will not tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you do not tell about our little bonking incident.
monica, number one, i do not think ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, i... (joey starts laughing in the background) (to joey) what?!
you said number two.
i also said number one.
i know. (giggles harder)
(entering) hey! everyone.
hi!
how is my little boy?
he is perfect, he is never been better.
(noticing the outfit he is wearing) what did you do, take him whaling?
oh my god, he just said your name, that is great! good job ben.
oh that is right, that is what I would sound like if i exploded.
woo-hoo! the curse is broken! i called everybody i know, and everyone is alive.
uh.
what?
ugly naked guy looks awfully still. (phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
oh my god! i killed him! i killed another one! and this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
well maybe he is just taking a nap.
I am tellin’ ya, he has not moved since this morning.
all right, we should call somebody.
and tell them what? the naked guy we stare at all the time is not moving.
well, we have got to find out if he is alive.
how are we going to do that? there is no way.
well, there is one way. his window’s open, i say, we poke him.
hey! y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get chinese food?
yeah.
well, now we got a reason.
what?
well, we are fashioning a very long poking device.
all right.
hey uh, what is a matter?
i talked to janice.
oh my god, is she going back to him?
she does not know. says she loves us both. y'know i woke up this morning and i was in love, well i was happy. y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. and now i can not even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
what are you ah, what are you going to do?
i do not know, y'know. what, what, would you do?
well, it does not matter what i would do.
come on, tell me.
all right, you are probably not going to want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (chandler gets ready to throw another dart) i would ah, i would bow out.
what? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) what are you, what are you talking about?
they have a kid together, y'know. they are like, they are like a family, and if, i do not know, there is chance they could make that work, i know i would not want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. are you okay? do you want to ah, come poke a nude guy?
well, he is finally alseep. about that ah, bump on his head?
are you, are you, are you sure it is ah, a new bump? i mean, no offense, I have always thought of ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
it is okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, i figured you did the best you could.
(confidently) i did!
i know! I am saying you have to watch them all the time.
i did!! i watched! i watched! i watched monica bang his head against that thing!
monica did it?
monica?
yeah.
umm, did you notice anything wierd about ben today?
no. why?
well, i was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he is leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ it is like they just ah, i do not know, fell out of his head.
really?!
oh, and also, he is, he is walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he is in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle)
oh my god, i wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)
i hope it is still funny when you are in hell.
(coming out of the bedroom) you jerk! you know how much i love that kid! (starts to chase ross around the living room)
monica bang! monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) ow!
I will get the hat.
janice, i have something i need to tell you, and i want you to let me get through it, because it is, it is, it is not going to be easy.
i think you should go back with gary. i do not want to be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. whenever i would see him i was always think y'know ‘you are the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and i hated that guy. and it did not matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my dad.
yeah, well. it is the right thing to do.
then do not leave me!
forget what i said, i was babbling! pick me!
no you do not! no, no, no, i say you have to give your divorce another chance.
ohhh. do not go.
no. no! no! no!
i do not care! (turns around and to the people watching them) i do not care!!
you can not leave! i have your shoe!
all right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately i have a lot of experience in that area.
can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
I am telling you he is dead. what we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
all right, ladies and gentlemen, let us poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) steady. steady. okay, a little higher. careful of the angle. okay, okay, we are approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of ugly naked guy, so that we actually see him!) thread the needle. thread the needle.
he is alive! he is a-live!!!
and yet, we are still poking him.
okay, retract the device, retract the device.
he does not look happy.
hey-hey, now he is showing us his poking device.
hey, that is never going to make it all the way over here, buddy!
(singing) I will hold you close in my arms. (phoebe enters) i can not resist your charms. and love....
(joining him) love....
(high pitched) no you know i do not mind.
i know.
i know.
I have found.
I have found....

why?! what is happening to the coffee house?! (monica looks at her.) oh! (realizes.)
yep! from now on its going to be the four of you guys and me and the misses. the little woman. the wife. the old ball and chain.

okay! you guys are getting married tomorrow and-and i could not be more thrilled for both of you, but as monica’s older brother i-i have to tell you this. if you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever because her any unhappiness of any kind, i will hunt you down, and kick your ass! (chandler laughs.) what? I am-I am-I am serious! (chandler laughs harder.) come—hey! dude! stop it! okay? I am-I am not kidding here!
(smiling) hey, i hear what your saying, okay? and, thanks for the warning.

all right, I am going to go steam my wedding dress okay? who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
I will do it.
who wants it? anybody?
i said I will do it!
nobody wants to do it? all right, I will do it myself.
monica! I am not going to screw it up!
y’know what? you are right, I am sorry. actually you were a big help tonight. yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
well of course that is what I am here for!
okay. sorry. (monica goes into the bathroom.)
ugh! (to phoebe) what grandmother?
hey! where have you been?
oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
oh.
what? are you going back to work?
yeah.
nice shades.
thanks. yeah, i figure if i wear these in my scenes at least i will not get spit in the eyes, y’know?
and if i remember correctly, ray ban was the official sponsor of world war i!
great! all right. I will see you later. (he starts to leave.)
hey, where is chandler?
uh, i think he is in rachel’s room. see ya. (exits.)
(going up to rachel’s closed door) chandler? (he opens the door and looks inside and does not see him.) chandler? (he checks the bathroom and still does not find him. he then finds a note on the counter. he picks it up and reads it.)
hey!
hi!
is uh, is monica here?
she is steaming her dress, why? what is up?
i think chandler’s gone. (he hands her the note.)
what?!
he left that.
(reading the note) tell monica I am sorry.
(walking up) what is up? (rachel hands her the note and she reads it.) tell monica I am sorry. (pause) tell her yourself!
oh my god! chandler just left though!
yeah but, maybe it is not what we think. maybe it is tell monica I am sorry i…drank the last of the milk.
or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he is changed his name, y’know? tell monica I am sorry.
i think it means he freaked out and left!
do not be so negative! good god! is not it possible that sorry is sitting in there (joey and rachel’s apartment) right now?!
okay. phoebe, i-i think ross is right. what are we going to do?
look—okay, I am just going to—I am going to have to go find him and bring him back! okay? you-you make sure monica does not find out, okay?
okay.
(pointing at ross) okay but if you do not find him and bring him back, i am going to hunt you down and kick your ass!
(scared) i will, i will find him.
oh man! they-they just redid my make-up!
all right.
picture? what picture?
okay uh, look i know you are a great actor, okay? and you play all those shakespeare guys and stuff…
but you are spittin’ all over me man!
you know you have been spitting on me?!
(wiping face) wow! did not know that.
thanks! okay-okay check it out! (reading from the script) picture? what picture? (he pauses then spits) eh?
gunther have you uh, have you seen chandler?
oh damn!
yes. yes. do not worry. everything’s fine. we will uh, we will see you tomorrow at the wedding.
well then we will-we will see you the day after tomorrow. (walks away slowly, but notices something.) mom?! dad?! (they are sitting by the window.) what-what…what you guys doing here?!
why?!
(shocked) gunther?!
what? your-your list?
yes! no-no! i know, i know what the list is! mom! look if you see chandler, could you just let him know I am looking for him?
what picture?!
you went through my personal property?
(pause) because vincent, we were lovers. (pause) for two years!
great scene yeah?
thanks a lot.
oh, I am-I am not working tomorrow.
no! no! i can not! you got to get me out of it! I have got plans! (spits.) important plans! (spits on the ps.)
(closing the door) ross said there is still no word from chandler.
oh man.
oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
okay. well there is one down.
(entering from her room, excitedly) I am getting married today!!! (she trips and falls.) (getting up) i think i just cracked a rib. but i do not care because today’s my wedding day! my day is finally here!! (runs back into her room.)
y’know she might not even notice he is gone.
(re-entering) I am going to start getting ready! (goes back into her room.)
god! do not—we can not let her start getting ready! this is too awful! oh god, but wait she will be in the gown and then he will not show up and then she is going to have to take off the gown…
shhh! stop it! stop it rachel! you can not do this here! (she drags her into the bathroom.)
I am sorry. I am sorry. it is just…it is just so sad!
yeah, but you have got to pull yourself together! monica can not see you like this! then she will know something is wrong!
i know. i know. oh god. (looking around) there is no tissue! can you grab me some toilet paper?
yeah. (looks.) oh, that is gone too. this is monica’s bathroom right?!
oh!
no-no! i-i…i found one.
okay.
oh thank you! (wiping her nose.) oh god! (she throws it out.) can i have another one?
(looking into the trash can) sure. (reaching into the trash can.) do you need some floss? (grabs a piece of it.)
oh god i just can not imagine what is going to happen if chandler does not show up!
oh here is a whole bunch.
oh, i mean she is going to be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "oh that poor girl." y’know? then she will have to come back here and live all alone.
(finding something interesting in the trash can) oh my god!
what?
there was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it is positive. monica’s pregnant. (rachel covers her mouth.) so i guess she will not be totally alone.
oh my god!
i know! monica’s going to have a baby! hey, can this count as her something new?
oh my god!
hey, do you think this is why chandler took off?
no, she had to have just taken that test because i took out the trash last night.
oh god, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! the bride is pregnant. the groom is missing. and I am still holding this. (she throws the test back into the trash.)
okay phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
right.
okay?
yeah, okay. hey, wait. do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
no. why?
just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
anything?
no! i talked to joey on the set, he has not heard from him. i-i-i talked to chandler’s parents again!
you told them he was missing?
no! i made it seem like i was just calling to chat. pretty sure, they both think I am interested in them.
all right, we have got to tell her he is gone. (starts to leave.)
no! hey! hey! we can not!
ross, she is going to start getting ready soon!
well, can not you at least stall her a little? I will-I will go back to some of the places i went last night.
all right, well how much time do you need?
well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
one hour.
give me two.
then why do you ask?!
okay, wish me luck.
okay. I am going with you.
why?!
ross, you are tired. you have been looking all night. and clearly you suck at this.
all right, I will see you guys later.
okay. wait, do you know how you are going to stall her?
I will figure something out.
all right. good luck.
thanks.
hey! okay, so i thought we would start with my make up and then do my hair.
okay uh, but before you do that. i-i, i need you to talk to me.
about what?
umm… I am never going to getting married!
yeah you will! the right guy is just around the corner! okay, are we done with that?
no monica! I am serious! oh, maybe i should just forget about it. become a lesbian or something.
any woman would be lucky to have ya.
well maybe it would make me feel better if i slept with joey.
(jumping up) rachel! you okay?
excuse me, aaron? (the director turns around.) hi! umm, i have a little problem with the schedules. originally, i was not supposed to work today, and i have this wedding that i really have to be at. it is my best friend’s, and I am officiating so i really can not work past four.
I am having surgery!
yeah, i-i just made up the stuff about the wedding because i did not want you to worry about me. but, I am having surgery today.
transplant.
hair transplant.
it is not on my head.
hey! you are here! great! great! great! let us get going buddy, we have got a scene to shoot!
are you drunk?
yes you are!
we are never going to find him! he is one guy in a huge city!
oh my god! is that him? (she points at someone.)
that is an old, chinese woman!
he could be in disguise, y’know.
aw, y’know…y’know, maybe we are-we are just approaching this all wrong. if you are chandler and-and you want to hide, where is the last place on earth people would think you would go?
so this is your office?
how did you guys find me? i knew i should have hid at the gym!
what the hell are you doing?!
panicking! and using the internet to try to prove that I am related to monica. how is she?
she is fine. she does not know you are gone. and she does not have to know, okay? now come on, we are going home.
no! no! no! i can not do that!
why not?!
because if i go home, we are going to become the bings! i can not be the bings!
what is wrong with being the bings?
the bings have horrible marriages! they yell. they fight. and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
no.
then you are neither of your parents!
it is not just their marriage! i mean, look at yours. look at everybody’s! the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman! and I have met me; i am not paul newman. i do not race cars! i do not make popcorn! none of my proceeds go to charity.
but look chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than i do. but i totally believe you can do this.
i want to. i love her so much, but I am afr…it is too huge.
y’know, okay. you are right. it is huge. so why do not we take it just a little bit at a time? okay? umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. can you just come home and take a shower?
well yeah, but then…
(interrupting him) yeah—no-but-but-but-but! we are just going to go home and take a shower. now, that is not scary right?
depends on what you mean by we.
the nights are the hardest. (checks her watch.) but then the day comes! and that is every bit as hard as the night. and then the night comes again…
(interrupting) the days and nights are hard! i get it! okay? look umm, rachel I am sorry! i have to start getting ready! I am getting married today!
i know. at dusk. that is such a hard time for me.
(getting up) I am going to go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour! (starts for the bathroom.)
okay. but wait!
what?!
let us go to lunch.
i can not go to lunch!!
right.
oh good god! I have fallen down! (she trips and falls.)
(entering) what is going on?
okay. all right. (gets up.) honey listen. when i tell you what I am about to tell you, i need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
okay, you are-you are really freaking me out.
we can not find chandler…(phoebe sticks her head and motions that they found chandler)—‘s vest. we can not find chandler’s vest.
how can that be?! oh wait! wait! are you, are you serious?!
(entering) found the vest! i mean we are going to have to keep an eye on it, y’know make sure we do not lose it again…
oh!
oh wow! okay. do not scare me like that okay? i mean for a minute there i was like, "oh my god! the worst has happened!"
i would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
what?! he got me! owwwwww!!!
look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. okay? and I am the minister. please! please! can you pull it together?
thank you. thank you.
i would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
so-so you two were married huh? what happened? you just drift apart?
oh my god monica!
i want to wear this everyday.
you look so beautiful.
(starting to cry) I am so happy for me.
hello?
(on phone) hey! did chandler show up yet?
yeah, we got him back. everything’s fine.
damnit!
what? why? where are you?
I am still on the set!
joey! the wedding is in less than an hour!
i know! I am sorry! the guy’s drunk, they will not let me go until we get this.
oh my god! I am going to have to find another minister.
no! no, I am the minister! all right, look-look, put ‘them both on the phone, I will marry them right now.
ugh! joey, i have to go.
hey! do not you hang up on me! I will marry you and me right now! i have the power!
there you go. you put on a tuxedo! now that was not so scary, was it?
no.
I am telling you, just a little bit at a time.
yeah okay. well, what is the next little bit?
getting married. (chandler panics.) okay. okay. you can, you can do that too! just like you have done everything else!
yeah. you are right. hey i-i can do that.
yeah.
okay, excuse me for a minute. (starts to leave)
wh—hey—whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
ross, i am not going to run away again! i just want to get a little fresh air.
okay.
okay.
oh fresh air!
(to rachel) wait! maybe, maybe you are overreacting! you do that y’know.
well phoebe, we got to do something! (they turn the corner.) well, y’know. i mean there is no way joey’s going to make it in time. so I am going to through the hotel and see if there is any other weddings going on.
okay. oh but do not tell them monica’s pregnant because, they frown on that.
okay.
okay.
anastassakis/papasifakis wedding, excellent! {it is a good thing jennifer aniston is greek, because she had to pronounce those names. luckily for me, they were written on a sign.}(the happy couple emerges.) congratulations. (to the best man and maid of honor) mazel tov! (the rabbi emerges.) hi! oh, great hat. (he is wearing an interesting hat and she takes him over to talk.) listen umm, i need you to perform another wedding. can you do that?
yeah! yeah. they are…they are-they are my friends, uh, monica stephanopolus and uh, and chandler acidofolus.
hi! (to mrs. bing) hi! (mr. bing starts rubbing his arm.) hi. has umm, anyone seen chandler?
he-he was with me umm, we are playing a little game, y’know? hide and seek.
(pause) you are right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
oh my god! monica!
i know! hey, how is chandler doing?
great. he is doing great. do not you worry about chandler.
are you okay?
uh-huh.
well, you are-you are sweating.
these-these are beads of joy.
oh that is sweet. do not touch me.
uh phoebe, can i see you for a second?
yeah!
what is going on?
chandler’s gone again!
oh my god! why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
aaron! you got to let me go. the guy’s hammered!
so i uh, i just talked to the director. that is it, we are done for the day.
yeah! you…you were wonderful.
so i got your car, it is right outside.
that is what you told me.
no-no-no! we got to go! come on! (joey picks him up in a fireman’s carry and carries him out.) here we go.
(turning a corner) there he is!!
what?
hey! oh!
you are not getting away this time mister! unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!
ross! (he starts to get up.)
hiiii-ya!! (chandler lies back down.) I am serious! you are not walking out on my sister!
(standing up) that is right! I am not!
then where the hell have you been?!
i know about monica.
you know?!
what?
yeah, i heard you and rachel talking.
what?! what?! talking about what?!
you do not know?
know what—if somebody does not tell me what is going on right now…
what? you will hi-ya?
monica’s pregnant.
oh my god. oh my god! and you are-you are…you are not freaking out?
well i was! then i went down to the gift shop because i was out of cigarettes…
big picture please! so i was in the gift shop, and that is when i uh, saw this. (he holds up a little, tiny baby jumper that reads i (heart) new york.) yeah, y’know what? i thought anything that can fit into this, can not be scary.
well you obviously did not see chucky 3.
but come on, look at how cute and small this is! so i got it to give monica so she would know i was okay.
dude. (hugs him.)
you look beautiful mom. (his dad clears his throat.) you look beautiful too dad. i love you both. (he kisses his dad on the cheek) I am so glad you here. (he kisses his mom.)
are you joey?
huh. this is nice.
what?
I have never walked down the aisle knowing it can not end in divorce.
she is right there.
you look beautiful. is this new? (her dress.)
not now.
okay.
(to chandler) who is this?
(in monica’s ear) he is greek orthodox.
(leaning in) as are you…
(entering) that is my line! (he walks up the aisle and to the rabbi) i can take it from here, thanks. (to all) dearly beloved, I am sorry I am a little late. you may be confused by this now, (he is still in costume) but you will not be memorial day weekend 2002. well, let us get started before the groom takes off again. huh? (monica is shocked and looks around.) we are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I have known monica and chandler for a long time, and i can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. and now, as I have left my notes in my dressing room. we shall proceed to the vows. monica?
(to rachel) he took off?
go on! go on. (she turns back to chandler.)
chandler, for so long i…i wondered if i would ever find my prince, my soul mate. then three years ago, at another wedding i turned to a friend for comfort. and in stead, i found everything that I would ever been looking for my whole life. and now…here we are…with our future before us…and i only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. unless you do not want to. you go!
chandler?
(to ross) no, that is okay. (ross nods and retreats.) monica i thought this was going to be the most difficult thing i ever going to had to do. but when i saw you walking down that aisle i realized how simple it was. i love you. any surprises that come our way it is okay, because i will always love you. you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with. you want to know if I am sure? (he leans in and kisses her.)
you may not kiss the bride. so, i guess by the powers vested in my by the state of new york and the internet guys, i now pronounce you husband and wife. oh wait! do you take each other?
i do.
i do.
yeah you do!
rings?
aw crap! okay—uh…uh let us-let us do the rings.
we good? yeah? good? once again, i pronounce you husband and wife. (to chandler) now kiss her again.
(to monica) i love you. and i know about the baby.
what baby?
our baby.
we have a baby?
phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
i did not take a pregnancy test.
then…who did?
oh and they are going to have a baby.
uh-huh.
hey!
hi!
who wants french toast?
oh, I will have some!
good, me too. (tosses him the loaf.) eggs and milk are in the fridge. thanks.
(entering from her room) oww!
what is the matter honey?
i do not know, my hand feels weird. i guess it is because, I am engaged! (shows off the ring.) how long before it starts getting annoying?
it starts?
yeah, so let us get started on the wedding plans!
okay! (runs off.)
(incredulous) already?!
yeah, we got a lot to do! we got to think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…
oh, i got some thoughts on that.
oh wait chandler, too many cooks…
take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
(returning) okay! (sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)
what in god’s name is that?!
oh my god, the wedding book?! i have not seen that since the forth grade!
this baby has got everything. take y’know, locations for instance. (she opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) first, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
that is so smart! (to chandler, under her breath) break it off. break it off now.
and that should conclusively prove that i had the idea for jurassic park first! now let us take a look at… (phoebe rushes in.)
hey! ross!
phoebe, oh my god! wh-wh-what are you doing here?
i need to talk to you, it is pretty urgent. it is about monica and chandler.
oh my god! of course, of course. (to the class.) umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? umm, do you know each other’s hometowns? why do not you… (motions that they should learn everyone is hometown.) (to phoebe) wh-what is going on?
well, umm, not much. but, i was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? so, could i just move in with you for a couple days?
umm, okay, yeah, sure. but wh-what is wrong with monica and chandler?
nothing—why?!
phoebe, you said it was urgent!
oh yeah it is! I am going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
do you realize i have a classroom full of students?
(to the students) oh, I am sorry. I am so rude. does anyone want to come to the movies?
all right, so i have not cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
okay.
all right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
aw.
a jazz trio for cocktails. the bay city rollers for dancing. wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
well, you could not get them anyway. ian does not plan anymore and derrick… (off of rachel and monica’s looks) and derrick is a name i should not know.
(sitting up from the couch) hey mon, do you have another pillow? (holds up one.) y’know, something a little snugglyer?
why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
well, the duck…
what?! the duck?! what the hell did the damn duck do now?!
uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
of course you can look at it! yeah, i want your opinion too!
okay.
here you go! what do you think about centerpieces?
centerpieces!
yeah! roses or lilies? (holds up a picture of each.)
definitely roses. (monica and rachel exchange a look.) well, i just think they are a little more weddingy. (monica holds the lily picture closer to him.) but lilies are the clear choice.
oh my god! it is like one mind.
uh-huh!
(sitting up again) guys! guys!! you got to let me nap! ugh, I am going to get cranky!
joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
what?!
all right, I am going to go! (gets up and heads for the door.)
now joey, what did the duck do?!
i do not know! but he did not eat your face cream!
hey little buddy, how are you feeling? (the duck does not get sick and joey recoils in horror and heads for the couch.) what the hell is in that face cream? (he is about to try out the couch but notices the bed in rachel’s room. he walks into her room and feels the bed.) that is so soft. (he pulls back the comforter.) pillowcases! (he climbs in and groans in delight. suddenly, he feels something under him and pulls out a little beat up paperback book. he opens it and starts to read from it.) (in his head.) zelda looked at the chimney sweep. her father, the vicar…(stops reading and thinks.) the vicar? (continues reading) …would not be home for hours. her loins were burning. she threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his…(out loud.) whoa! (reads on in silence.) whoa-ho-ho-ho! this is a dirty book! (continues to read.)
uh, phoebe…
oh ross, hi.
phoebe, what are you doing?
I am sorry, I am with a client right now.
phoebe!
okay, let us talk outside.
phoebe, you can not massage people in my apartment!
what is the big deal? i did it at monica and chandler’s!
and they knew about it?
(pause as she considers it) okay, well ross, what is this really about?
look, this is my home and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want!
okay, i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. i just do not know what the big deal is!
the big deal is i do not want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when i want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! cold beer.
hey joey, what ‘cha doing?
sweepin’. why? turn you on?
no.
huh. what if i was sweeping a chimney?
joey, did you my face cream?
where are you going? the vicar will not be home for hours.
joey, (nervously) where did you learn that word?
where do you think, (pause) zelda?
(gasps) you found my book?!
yeah i did!
joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
okay, look I am sorry, i went in there to take a nap and i know i should not have, but you got porn!
hey-hey, y’know what? i do not care! I am not ashamed of my book. there is nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. it is just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (she goes into her room.)
you got porn!
hello.
uh no-no, she-she is out for the night.
can i, can i help you with something?
(deadpan) yes i am.
oh yeah, i should probably call them.
oh, i do not think i ever heard that story.
oh dad, really you do not need to…
what a sweet story.
well, at least you are not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party.
anyway, we are really excited about our wedding plans, and well i guess pretty soon we will be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund. (chandler and her laugh, but her parents do not.) what?
what happened? you still have the monica wedding fund do not you?
i do not believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
you bought the beach house when i was 23!
what about when i started dating chandler?
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
i can not believe it! that there is no money for my wedding?!
okay! now, I am going to touch you. (he does so, very gingerly.) ohh, that is soft. (he starts poking him and notices his salad spoons and starts to massage him with those.)
i can not believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
i do not know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. she is saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (pause) dollywood.
well what happened at dinner?
my parents spent the money for our wedding!
(gasps) my god! what did you order?!
wait, but there is no money! well this is terrible! you guys are going to have to get married in like a, rec. center!
honey, it is going to be okay.
no! no it is not! it is not going to be okay! it sucks! no swing band! no lilies!
no, y’know what? it is going to be okay. i mean you do not have to have this rustic italian feast. y’know? and-and you do not need, you do not need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (she starts to cry, as does monica.)
look, it really is going to be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that we are going to get married.
do you even understand what off the rack means?!
look, why do not you just pay for it yourself?
how? i do not have any money.
well, i have some.
how much?
well, close to… (notices rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to monica as phoebe averts her eyes.)
whoa!!! are you kidding me?!
well what?! how-how much is it?!
it is enough for wedding scenario eight.
ohh! (whispers.) really?!
(to chandler) how great are you, you little saver?! i mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
(starting to cry) ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
well, you are not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
well, come on, I have been saving this money for six years and i kind of had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
(reading the slip of paper) wow! (in a sultry voice) hello, mr. chandler.
this is the most special day of our lives.
no, i realize that honey, but I am not going to spend all of the money on one party.
honey, umm i-i love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. okay? (laughs) listen, we could always earn more money, okay? but uh, we are only going to get married once.
look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no.
you-you are going to have to put your foot down?
yes, i am!
wow, money and a firm hand. finally a chandler i can get on board with.
hey rach.
(quietly) joey.
hey rach, do you smell smoke?
uh-huh, i get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
no-no-no, I am serious. you do not smell it? something is on fire.
well no, i do not smell anything.
oh, y’know what? it is probably just your burnin’ loins.
(sitting down) hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
nothing!
(takes a drink) damn, this coffee’s cold! hey rach, do you mind if i heat this up on your loins? (joey and he both laugh.)
y’know, i can not believe you told him, joey!
so i guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
uh-huh, yeah i did, because i wore out my first copy when i was with you. (exits.)
(chases her) oh yeah, yeah? well uh, when we were going out, i read tons of porno magazines! (realizes a table of women overheard him.) (to that table.) ‘sup?
(entering) ross! how could you do that to an old man?!
(looking at the table) excuse me ladies. (to phoebe) I am sorry?
my massage client, arthur? his daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
(incredulous) i gave him an extremely professional massage!
he said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
okay, so it was not uh, a traditional massage. but i did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. and, and i gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
well, he is never coming back! okay? you just cost me eight dollars a week!
hey, y’know what? this is your fault! you are the one that did not move his-his appointment.
oh, it is my fault?! you did not have to massage him! you could have sent him away! you could have not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back!
he said he liked that!! oh you are right, you are right. I am sorry.
dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
his daughter was hot.
gotcha.
hey.
hey.
listen umm, I have been thinking, it is not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
ehh.
eh, you work for that.
look, i thought about it too, and I am sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
you do?!
yeah, I am putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that is what we are going to do.
oh, you are so sweet. (they hug and kiss.) oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y’know? we will pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
you thought about that?
yeah.
how many kids were we going to have?
uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
what else did you think about?
well, stuff like where did we live, y’know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it is collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we would have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.
(laughs) y’know what? i-i do not want a big, fancy wedding.
sure you do.
no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage.
you sure?
uh-hmm.
i love you so much.
i love you. (they kiss.) hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
oh yeah, totally!
oh good.
hello, zelda.
who are you supposed to be?
the vicar!
do you even know what a vicar is?
like a goalie, right?
(sarcastically) yeah. look joey, it is enough all right?! you keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it is—I am not—it is just not funny anymore!
all right, I am sorry. rach i—rach I am sorry. okay? I am sorry! maybe i can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn. (giggles.)
all right! y’know what? that is it! you want to do it?! let us do it!
huh?
(starting to move closer to him) that is right, i want to do it with you! I have been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
(nervously backing away) i-i-i-i did? (he puts a stool in front of her.)
(moves the stool out of the way) yeah! ohh, I have been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
this body? (he backs into the kitchen.)
yeah that is right! come on joey; sex me up!
hey-hey, you are startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.
oh, come on now, do not keep me waiting. get those clothes off! but, i would keep that helmet on because you are in for a rough ride! (he backs into the door.)
i do not want to, I am scared.
hey rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
(looking at her fingers) oh my…god! let me see that! (grabs the book from him.)
(laughing) you fall for it every time!
(entering) hey!
hi!
i brought you my old maternity clothes! (sets a bag on the counter.)
oh pheebs that is so sweet—(grabs a pair of pants)—ooh, those are so cute!
yeah! and look, (grabs the pants) see how they expand as the baby grows? (there is a stretchy part in front.) and then after the baby’s born, they are great for shoplifting melons.
(entering) oh good you are all here. thanksgiving tomorrow, four of the clock. (to rachel) oh, guess who i invited. remember that guy will colbert from high school?
no.
he was in ross’s class…marching band…kind of overweight? well, really overweight. i mean i was his thin friend.
wow! i do not remember him. honey, are you sure you are not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
no that was jarred! wow! i have not thought about him in a long time… (stares off into the distance lost in thought.) (pause) anyway, umm will’s, will’s here on business and he did not have a place to go so i invited him here.
oh that is nice.
oh, and by the way, he is lost a bunch of weight. i mean he looks goo-ood! okay, i mean really, really gorgeous! (joey clears his throat.) i still love chandler.
i just want you to say it once in a while.
all right okay, just so you know, I am not going to make a turkey this year.
what?!
well phoebe does not eat turkey…
phoebe!
turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!
no they are not! they are ugly and stupid and delicious!
all right! okay, it is just phoebe. will’s still on a diet, chandler does not eat thanksgiving food, and rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.
she is?
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
yeah. but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
anyway, it just does not seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. okay? it is a lot of work.
but you got to have turkey on thanksgiving! i mean, thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like fourth of july with no apple pie! or friday with no two pizzas!
all right fine! if it means that much to you! but just—there is going to be a ton left over.
no there will not! i promise i will finish that turkey!
all right, you are telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
that is right! ‘because I am a tribbiani! (to rachel) and this is what we do! i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we do not read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! we can eat!
hey, is not weird to think about how next year at this time they will be a little baby at the table? (chandler turns around in horror.) (seeing him) rachel’s! but good to know where you are at!
(entering) hey!
hey!
happy thanksgiving!
you too!
anything i can do to help?
actually there is. chandler usually helps me with this, but he is really into the game so i do not want to bother him. could you help me fold these napkins? (hands her a stack of them.)
sure!
I am going to go across the hall to check on the yams.
okay. (she starts folding the napkins in half.)
no! no! no! no sweetie! no! not like that! we are not at a barn dance. you have got to—you want to fold them like swans. like i showed you at christmas time, remember?
yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (monica exits.) (to chandler) so how is the game?
i have no idea.
what?
yeah! I am just pretending to watch the game so i do not have to help out with stuff.
i do not believe you! that is…brilliant! and monica has no idea?
nope! every once and a while i just scream stuff at the tv.
is your team winning hon?
yeah! anderson just scored again! (to phoebe) there is no anderson.
well i want to get in on this. hey mon? i do not think i can help you after all, i did not realize this game was on.
oh, i did not know you liked football.
well normally i do not, but y’know…(looks at the tv)…green bay is playing.
you like green bay?
well it is only like my favorite bay! {actually, it is not bad. it just gets a little cold in winter, but in wisconsin winter only lasts from august to june. j }
hey!
aww thanks! god will I am so glad that you came! you look great! you must have lost like…
a pie! (will brought a pie.)
you want to meet some people? this is uh; this is my husband chandler. chandler, this is will.
oh hey. I would shake your hand but uh; I am really into the game. plus, i think it would be better for my ego if we did not stand right next to each other.
this is phoebe.
(nonchalantly glancing) hey. (turns back around.) wow! (looks up.) well done.
(to will) want to give me a hand?
well you look incredible too! you are just—you are so fit!
I am watching the game, but I am not deaf!
oh umm, i meant to tell you, ross is coming.
good. and rachel green too. (will stops suddenly.)
is there a problem?
what?
(to phoebe) y’know, it is been a while since we have screamed something. maybe we should.
oh okay.
oh come on!
noooo!! damn you ref! you burn in hell!!!
hey, what are you doing? you got to save room, you have got almost an entire turkey to eat.
let me explain to you how the human body works. i have to warm my stomach first. eatin’ chips is like stretching.
all right.
do not worry, tribbianis never get full.
(to monica) who the hell is this guy?
will! from high school.
oh hey!
(to will) joey.
(entering) will!
hey-hey you came! man you look incredible! hot stuff! (they hug and ross realizes what he said.) hot stuff?
yeah, you too. man, so-so what are you up to?
really? yeah that-that sounds interesting.
oh! man i do not think I have seen you since uh, lance davis’ graduation party.
yeah. it would have been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
yeah.
(laughs) yeah.
so how long are you in town?
(entering, carrying a baking dish) hi!
hey sweetie. oh good. (takes the baking dish from her.)
aw—oh, that is right. are-are you going to be okay?
will, high school was-was a long time ago.
(sees will) oh my god monica, who is that?
that is will from high school!
oh! i do not remember him! wow! he is really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on. (we see will angrily staring at rachel.) oh my god, he is… look at the way he is just staring at me. i think he is trying to mouth something to me, but i can not make it out. (will mouths, "i hate you.")
okay, dinner’s ready!
good game!
yeah.
yeah. solid effort. solid effort.
oh, so who won?
(simultaneously) green bay.
(simultaneously) detroit.
what?
well the lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the green bay…mermen.
hi! will, right?
hi! I am rachel green.
really?! are not you sweet! i got to tell you though, i am, i am having the hardest time placing you. oh-oh hang on! did we umm, did we fool around at lance davis’ graduation party?
thank you!
(breaking it up) uh rachel? rachel, why do not you sit here? (next to joey) and will you sit way over there. (the other side of the table.)
that is it?! even if nobody helps me i can eat that no problem. at least give me a challenge!
(laughs) this is chandler’s chicken. this is the turkey. (sets down a huge turkey.)
(quietly) oh. how-how big is that?
about nineteen pounds.
(to rachel) it is like me when i was born.
all right, who would uh, like some yams? will?
what? (joey starts offering ross some turkey.) oh y’know what? can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? the smell is just yuck!
I am sorry. what?
(to monica) seriously, who is this guy?
umm, I am sorry. do you-do you have a problem with me?
i think you do.
(to rachel) apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.
I am-I am—i had no idea. I am sorry. i…
oh will. but you-you have worked so hard…
okay. (chandler grabs the dish from monica and hands it to will who starts dishing out a large helping.)
uh will umm, i just want to say that I am real sorry for whatever i-i did to you in high school…
you had a club?!
whoa! my god! so what, you all just joined together to hate me?! who else was in this club?
no need to point, she knows who ross is.
(to ross) so you were in an i hate rachel club?
no. no.
so who else was in this club?
uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from thailand but i-i do not think he-he knew what it was.
so ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an i hate rachel club.
that was in high school! it is not like it was binding forever.
okay monica, did you know about this?!
i swear i did not. (to ross and will) hey! is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
hmm, a little relieved, i got to say.
look rach i-I am sorry, okay? i…i was a stupid kid, okay? the only reason i joined…
…co-founded. co-founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you. obviously i did not handle it very well. but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club.
okay. so what? you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
no-no! no-no. no-no.
what?! what else did you do?
what rumor?
oh, come on will! just take off your shirt and tell us!
ross!
it was no big deal. we-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
what?!
(shocked) oh my god!
you started that?!
what?! you heard that?! (goes and stands behind joey.)
everyone at our school heard it!
everybody at my school heard it! you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island?!
oh no!!!! oh my god!! this is all making so much sense to me now! this is why adam carter would not go out with me! this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region! (motions to her breasts.) (joey has turned around.)
actually, billy tratt is gay now. so-so that one’s not really our fault.
monica, how come you never told me this?!
i thought it might be true. and i was afraid that you were going to cry and then show it to me.
joey stop staring! there is nothing there! it is not true!
I am afraid I am going to need proof.
oh! (hits him and storms out.)
you are my everest.
joey, you do not have to finish that.
oh yes i do. otherwise what is next? today I am just a guy who can not finish a turkey, but tomorrow I am the guy who eats half a powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? no! no, i just…i just—i got to change my pants. (gets up and heads for the door.) jeans have no give. (exits.)
(entering carrying a book) okay! okay! listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "dear rach, you are such a good person." not girl! person!
rach, i think you are reading a little too much into it.
(reading what he wrote again) "dear rach, you are a great person. sorry about your tiney-wienie." (will laughs.)
look, what do you want me to do? do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it was not true?!
yes!
oh! me too!
well look-look I am not calling anybody! okay? it was like a million years ago!
i do not care how long ago it was! you told people that i was half and half! y’know what? i just want to point out i never did anything to hurt you in high school.
that is not totally true.
what?
what?
well you-you did start that rumor about ross making out with mrs. altman, our 50-year-old librarian.
(shocked) (to rachel) how did you know that?!!!!
it is true?!!
no.
yes it is! i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
I am sorry. when you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
hey! she did not look 50!
did she look 16?
ohh, there is a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
oh! (they all look.) wow!
she did not photograph well!
well, she probably was not familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
so how did this happen? did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
i was working late in the library one afternoon. it was just the two of us. she needed some help with her word jumble. and one thing led to another. if you must know, anita was very gentle and tender. may she rest in peace…
did not she walk with a cane?
only when it was damp!! (to rachel) i can not believe you-you told people about this?! everybody knew?! y’know what? (to will) I am back in the club!
i want to join!
wh—phoebe!!
I am sorry. I am sorry. i never got to be in a club. i-i did not go to high school, but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french. bonjour.
all right, y’know—fine! you guys have your stupid little club, but i would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you! you gave me a tiney-wienie! (will laughs.)
all right, listen you are just being silly. rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. one girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll!
wow…
and ross, if it were not for rachel’s rumor i mean no one in high school would even know who you were. she put you on the map!
as a romancer of the elderly.
hey! mrs. altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
the eyes…did still sparkle.
hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. you-you have been through so much since then. and right now you have got so much more important stuff going on in your life. can not you just let this go?
she is right.
yeah. i mean we are having a baby together.
yeah.
nope.
okay. (goes over and hugs him.) it is exactly how I would imagined it would be.
(entering, wearing the maternity pants from earlier) all right where is that turkey!
joey! those are my maternity pants!
not now! these are my thanksgiving pants!
well that is it. I am done. whew! (wipes his forehead.) there come the meat sweats. (chandler hands him a towel and he wipes his face.)
well joey, we are all…we are all very proud of you.
yes, i believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now.
is there anything we can do for you?
no just, nobody press on my stomach.
you can keep those pants by the way.
whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? what is that? pie?
yeah, you want some?
ah, just cut me a little sliver. (monica prepares to cut a little sliver.) a little bigger. (monica prepares to cut a bigger piece.) little bigger. (monica moves the knife again.) what?! are you afraid you are going to run out?! cut me a real piece!
okay, chandler!
okay.
and your horoscope says, "on the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
(to monica) oh, well thank you in advance. (kisses her.)
op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.
(to chandler) you are going to make a joke about my special present! why would you do that?!
oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
(entering) hey guys!
hey!!
(ecstatic) oh my god! it is joey tribbiani of mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.!!!!!!!
oh that is right. it is your first day! so are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
am i psyched? the lead in my own tv series? I have dreamed about this for years! why have i not been preparing?!
no! joey, you are going to be great!
but i got to act with a robot pheebs, and-and i do not know anything about technology! i can not even use chandler’s computer except to find porn! and-and that is only ‘because it is right there when you turn it on!
i think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.
(in a sexy voice to chandler) I will be waiting.
are you judging them by their covers? because you are really not supposed to do that.
no, I am just deciding which one to use—I am going to start writing another book!
be-because the last one was such a big seller?
well, if you must know i have written 14 books. and as i am the only one who has read them, i can tell you that they all have been very well received.
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey!
what are you guys doing later?
oh, rachel and i have appointments to get our hair cut.
(to phoebe) we do?
i want to see what he wants first.
okay.
(continuing) i just found out that elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.
wait a minute, hold the phone! you are not elizabeth’s dad?!
come on guys, i-i really want this guy to like me. it-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
thanks!
we know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
wow! huh? (picks up the phone) mac macaveli, private investigator!
okay. hey uh, when do i get to meet the robot?
okay.
oh wow! he is so lifelike! (starts touching the guy’s cheeks) unbelievable! (he starts tugging on the guy’s ears.
(slaps wayne on his cheek) how do you do there, wayne? (backs away.)
okay. sorry about that…(mimics that cheek thing he just did.) uh, so where is c.h.e.e.s.e.?
(laughs) this is like the temporary robot, right?
well, i-i just, i just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y’know? like the terminator or uh, when i first saw you.
I am sorry, it just—i do not know it does not really look like it can do anything.
it-it is great to meet you paul.
of course, of course, mr. stevens.
eh-wh—excuse me?
that is funny. umm…. (pause, then serious) it is not funny.
okay. i can, i can see that. umm, but i think if you give me umm, one chance i can, i can change your mind.
what?
this is—you—(ross starts laughing.)
okay, umm i want you to know that i have never done anything like this before. i mean, i mean I have been in um, relationships in general, uh but i have never done it with a student—i mean i not—not it! i mean, i mean i do not—we have not done it. uh, i mean, i mean, we have-we have-we have done stuff. (paul is not amused.) okay, okay, a joke, a joke—lighten the mood. umm, two guys go into a bar. one of them is irish.
and the irish guy wins the joke!
ross!!
ross!
how crazy that we would run into you!
oh god, thank you! (runs and gives all of them a group hug.) umm, uh, mr. stevens I would like you to meet my friends uh, this is phoebe, monica, and chandler.
you are elizabeth’s father, huh? i can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
(obviously attracted to him) is-is-is there a-a mrs. stevens?
there is a mr. bing!
okay umm, why do not we all take a seat, y’know? and uh, and I will get us all some uh some coffees—(he goes to pull out elizabeth’s chair, but paul steps in)—yeah, why do not you. (paul pulls out her chair) uh and you guys can talk about whatever, whatever you want. y’know? whatever pops into your head. (he turns his back to paul and elizabeth and points to himself for chandler, monica, and phoebe. then he goes to order the coffee.)
y’know, it is so strange seeing ross here this time of day, ‘because usually he is got the children’s hospital.
yeah. not looking for dates. (monica turns in horror.)
and he is a great brother!
ohh!
but uh ross, ross is a great guy! i was roommates with him in college. uh, funny story… (he starts laughing then notices that paul is not happy.) you are roommate in college died did not he?
(returning with the coffee) okay here we are paul, elizabeth. (he sets down their cups.) so i hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
yes, we were just…
hi, I am sorry I am late but i am ready, ready to talk you up! when does liz’s father get here?
oh! ross is sooo great!
hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were going to to get the kind with the baby.
no, you said the baby creeps you out.
no, the little girl creeps me out.
you said the baby.
why would the baby creep me out?
why would the little girl creep you out?
(writing frantically) you guys, I am sorry, could you please talk a little slower?
this is going in your book?
yeah, it is about relationships. y’know? the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. this stuff is great!
what?! excuse me!
and how none of it matters when the people really love each other. (chandler and monica kiss.) and how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it is a compliment.
(seeing him) oh hi!
oh! well let us look for them. (finds some under one of the couch cushions. it has a pink, fuzzy ball on the key chain.) oh-oh-hey! are these them?
all right! (throws them back under the cushion.)
oh good.
(chasing after him) oh, wait! sorry, mr. paul? mr. paul?
paul. umm, i just wanted you to know that ross really is a great guy.
you just do not look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
oh. we?
oh no! yes! of course, i know that! i just—i meant y’know are you still a ‘we’ or are you just ‘you?’
(sympathetic) ohh. so you raised her all on your own?
ohh. (she touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) ooh!
hey!
hey!
hey!
how was your first day?
pretty great! except i did get a little attitude from the robot.
damn those robots, they are supposed to be our faithful servants!
anyway, it was not the robot, it was the guy who controls him. yeah, he does not like me. he had c.h.e.e.s.e. knock over the sandwich right when i was reaching for one! ohh!
well, why do not you just get him fired?
i may have to, i hate to do it, but I am the star! y’know? there is a limit to how many sandwiches i can eat off the floor. (his cell phone rings) excuse me. (answers it, on phone) joey tribbiani.
wow!
I am the lead in mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.!!
joey?!
i was just getting him to like you.
joey?! joey!! (he runs into his bedroom.)
ross, joey is not here.
okay, I will just wait for him in here!
ross, it is okay. you can come out.
(coming out of the bedroom) oh! oh my god! i did not even see you!
bye!
what-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…
(incredulous) in your mouth?!
no! downstairs! and we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and i really liked him so i invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
you were at the coffeehouse!
ross, what is the big deal? so i kissed the guy!
he is my girlfriend’s father, okay? it is-it is, it is weird!
wh—you dated my sister!
that was different!
what? why?!
this is weird for me!
ross look, look this is good for you. okay? let us face it, so far the guy’s not loving ya! but i can turn that around! i got the inside track! we can all go out to dinner, y’know? and i can talk you up! ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
how is that important?
oh it is important!
apparently, there is like a million guys out there that can play mac, and there is only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! i did not know he could get me fired! what am i going to do?
well y’know joey, you are a pretty charming guy.
thanks, but i kind of have a problem to deal with here.
no sweetie, you have got to win over the guy that controls c.h.e.e.s.e.! you have got to kiss some serious robot ass!
that is not a bad idea. yeah. okay, but if i got to turn on the charm tomorrow I am not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (starts to leave, but stops and turns to phoebe.) well, actually i got a little bit saved for you pheebs. (exits.)
so do you think uh, joey’s more charming than me?
yeah! that is why I am sleeping with him on the side.
yeah, you wish. (stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
(writing in her book) "you wish."
phoebe, stop writing about us!
I am not writing about you! I am writing about other people.
who?
marcia and chester.
okay fine! fine! then you know what, I will just write about phyllis! hmm!
hmm.
(writing on a piece of paper) phyllis is sitting in a chair.
oh.
i see what you are doing!
(still writing) phyllis sees what I am doing.
oh-oh.
ooh, i have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
morning! hey, how is my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! (pats c.h.e.e.s.e. on the head.)
okay! (he yanks his hand away.) all right. umm, all right wayne, level with me. okay? i-i keep hearing all these rumors that i might get fired. okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! i mean, i love-i love this little guy! (he grabs c.h.e.e.s.e.’s arm and pulls it off at the elbow.) ah-ah!! (wayne is shocked.) okay, that is why you did not want me to touch him right? here you go! okay? (hands wayne the arm and he goes to fix it. meanwhile joey starts to berate himself.) stupid! i can not believe it! god! (a very beautiful woman walks by.) (to her) hey, how you doing? (he and her go over to talk and wayne looks on with envy.)
so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so ross selflessly, offered to take me.
wow! i definitely did not see that one backfiring! I am going to go to the bathroom.
yeah, take your time.
(to paul) just-just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior. so it was not as bad as-as…
not all bad.
yeah. you know what? i know what you mean; i do that too.
no! no! not—i do not mean i-i see her as a twelve-year-old girl! i mean i-i have a son, who is umm six and i still think of him as a baby.
yeah, well my-my ex-wife and i share custody of ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, carol and i are on excellent terms as I am sure you are with your wife! (realizes) oh, I am sorry! (to elizabeth) it is unbelievable!
oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), i mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
you are back.
oh! whoops! I am sorry, you were talking about emily!
chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
we said seven!
we said six!
the only way that i said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.
yeah and if i had seven, maybe i would have said something like this, "wow! my boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"
(turning around in the chair) hi!
oh my good god.
ugh!
i know what time you said.
what?!
well actually, i know what time chester and marcia said.
what time?
quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it is my book to the rescue, huh? (reading her book) ooh, very interesting. yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
(disgusted) what does it say?!
i will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
thank you for writing your book. its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
thanks! so are you.
(to monica) i told you i should not wear this color. (he is wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
(reading from her book) mon… (pause as she restarts) marcia and chester are planning on seeing a movie on sunday night. marcia thinks they are supposed to meet at six, chester thinks it is at seven.
so you knew we were going to miss the movie!
that is right.
inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
(writing in her book) marcia and chester are mad at phyllis.
i can not believe I am going to lose this job!
oh I am so sorry man! is there anything i can do?
yeah! help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
yeah? well, i do not want to talk to you wayne! i hate you! you ruined my life! oh, chandler, wayne. wayne, chandler. (they shake hands.)
hi, how are ya?
(incredulous) why should i help you?!
(whispering in joey’s ear) the reason he just said.
(happily) what do you need?
yeah?
what are you in love with her or something?
yeah, I have been there my friend.
oh wow wayne, it is not really something you can teach y’know? it is pretty much something you are born with if you—(off chandler’s look)—you-you can teach it! I will show you right how to do it.
i mean if you think about it, i mean ross did learn something from each marriage.
now wait a minute that is not fair. he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily, he just did not tell me. (everyone looks at her, ross not happily.) maybe i have to pee again. (gets up to try to use the bathroom.)
y’know what? i-i-i… i-i have had enough of this! y’know, i-i-i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect! so if-if you have got a problem with me, frankly…
god no!
well if it does not matter to her, it does not matter to me! (to paul) still not yelling!
that is okay, I am not so crazy about myself right now either.
uh yeah, i guess—yeah! i guess so.
ohhh! kids!
(returning) wait-wait-wait, i just thought of another story about how nice ross is!
that is okay rach, we are not liking ross right now.
oh! I have got a lot of those too!
well, it turns out you were right c.h.e.e.s.e.
you got it! and the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. nice catch c.h.e.e.s.e.! (pauses as he waits for c.h.e.e.s.e.’s next line.) it is your line c.h.e.e.s.e.! (suddenly c.h.e.e.s.e. goes crazy and starts flinging it is arms and advancing on joey behind the desk.) wayne! wayne!!
ready?
yeah.
okay.
hi...
it is...
rachel...
and…
phoebe’s...
please...
leave...
leave…
wait, i-i just said "leave."
yeah, i know because you have all the good words. what do i get? i get "it is," "and" oh I am sorry, i have "a." forget it.
phoebe, come on that is silly.
all right, so let us switch.
no, i have all of the good words. ok, fine, fine, we can switch.
okay.
okay.
hi…
everybody…
it is…
rachel…
and…
phoebe’s…
please...wait, how did you do that?
what?
oh, you are no ordinary roommate are you?
phoebe, come on can we finish this later? because i want to go running before it gets dark. oh! why do not you come with me?!
really?
yeah, it will be fun. we will run in the park. it will be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
okay, let us go running!
yeah and there is really cute guys there.
let us run towards them!
ok!
all right, wait just one more second. hi, it is phoebe and rachel's. please leave a message, thanks!
now wait a minute. you just took all the words!
uh-huh. you have met your match rachel green.
so, i just finished this fascinating book. by the year 2030, there will be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
(not amused) and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open.
hey!
(jumps over a box) honey, that is a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
i did not nail the boxes to the floor.
oh, so you can move them!
yes, and while I am doing that, ross has a great computer story for you.
hey everybody! uh, I would like you to meet janine. she is-she is going to be my new roommate!
hi! (rushes over to shake her hand instantly.)
yeah, she is going to live with me!
it is nice to meet you. janine...?
i did not know that! well, what a pretty last name!
so, uh, wh-where ya from?
(shocked) from the land down under? i did not know that either!
so uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
you are a dancer? she-she is a dancer!
oh, hey let me. (opens the door for janine and after he closes the door behind her gasps ecstatically.)
joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
of course i did.
uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
"when can you move in?"
thank you for bringing her into our lives.
unbelievable
oh, so you like her too chandler?
hey, look at all the boxes!
ugh, i cannot wait to ask her out!
wait a minute...joey. joey you can not ask her out, she is your roommate. it-it will be way too complicated.
yeah, yeah man do not do it. i mean if you date her, then-then-then i can not date her.
all right, think about it. now remember when you were going out with that girl donna and you guys broke up. remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
oh god, yeah.
now imagine you live at the supermarket.
(happily) okay!
no-no
oh, oh, you are right! i do not want that. i can not date her!
yeah and you better watch the flirting too, because you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
well, that is going to be tough mon. i mean it is hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
(chuckles) hmm, well you are around me all the time and you do not flirt.
you a little sad about that sweetheart?
i have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I will catch up.
okay. (runs off.)
okay. (starts running crazily with her arms flapping and her legs far apart) come on! that is not running! let us go! (rachel pauses, then follows, embarrassed.)
you guys, I am telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between kermit the frog and the six million dollar man.
monica had such a crush on him. yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
oh! i used to do that too!
did you also have his album, it is not easy being green?
aw, mon...(kisses her on the cheek)
so, phoebe runs weird huh?
yeah, yeah and you know what, i know she is going to want to run again, i just do not know how to get out of it, i mean, i live with her.
why do not you just be straight with her? tell her the truth.
yeah.
you are right, you are right. i should just tell her the truth.
hey!
hey!
pheebs, monica tripped me, i do not think i can ever run again, ever!
why? why would you do that?
i do not know. rachel I am-I am sorry that i hurt your ankles.
ankle.
we will see.
ok, I am officially unpacked. thanks for helping me man. (turns around and sees that joey is not there.) joe? (hears giggling coming from a box) well, i guess joey went home. oh and look, there is still one box that i have to unpack. (hears the giggling again)
(jumps out of the box) i gotcha!!
(pretending) oh my god! you-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
boy, it was so hard not to laugh, i tell ya. hey, hey, the place looks great!
yeah, not bad right? you know what, monica’s going to be working late, so I am going to make this place spotless. you know what else I am going to do, know what else I am going to do? I am going to go downstairs, I am going to get her some flowers. now who would not want to live with me?
(raises his hand) i do not! no, i want to live with the super-hot australian dancer.
yeah, now how is that going though? are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
yeah. well, so far yeah. but it is tough you know? i got all this built up flirting energy and i do not know how to get rid of it. (gives chandler the "joey-love," look.) how you doin?
(voice cracking) ohhhh man
no-no-no-no-no, it is-it is uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, i need to do my stretches too. (starts to stretch, groans painfully)
(jumps up and yells)
uh-uh nothing. i-i-i-i did not want you to touch me because I am -I am all sweaty from the workout. i better hit the shower. (goes into the bathroom and comes back out quickly) oh my god!
(jumps in front of rachel) hi! oh yeah, uh-huh, it is me. i saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. you lied so you could run by yourself.
no, no phoebe no, i was...no. you know what, i was, i was actually just checking to, see, if i could run. and i can!
please rachel, i am not an idiot. (runs off)
no, wait phoebe.
(enters) wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. so, mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?
what does it look like I am doing? i am cleaning!
did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
authorization? i do not need that. I am going to put everything back.
put it back exactly where you found it?
yes I am going to put it back (mocking ross) exactly where i found it.
‘kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
she is not going to care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
whoa, hello, did you just meet monica?
she is going to recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. because when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
i see, i see, y-y-you are trying to freak me out.
look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she is going to freak…out. oh my god, she is going to sit on you.
no, she is not okay? and I will prove it to you. I am going to call her right now. (picks up the phone and wipes it off) phone's done ehh.
(on phone) hi!
hey mon, how is it going?
terrible. if-if i want something done right, i have to do it myself. other people just wreck stuff. i really think i might kill someone tonight.
oh come on, come on, it can not be that bad.
it is worse. the only thing that is getting me through is knowing that I am going to be seeing you soon. i think i may even try to get out of here early.
no! no-no-no-no-no-no. it sounds like they really need you down there.
 well, are you just hanging out with ross?
it is, all good! okay bye-bye mon! (to ross) she is-she is going to kill me.
yeah, the phone was facing the other way. (chandler fixes it and a picture frame off the table.) and that goes back up there.
we should start with the big stuff. y’know? that will be the easiest. uh, let us start with the couch. (he picks up one end and ross does not help) i got it. (he moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
yeah that-that, does not look right.
what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(tries to rest his feet on the coffee table but they will not reach) ok, ok, here is what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch will not line up with he back of the carpet.
ok well here, we will just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table will not be centered in the seating area.
yes, but the coffee table does not match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!!!
(entering) look, what am i going to do? I am not flirting but still, I am drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! (tries to put his feet on the coffee table...they will not reach and looks around.) what the hell's going on over here?!?!? (points to chandler) monica's going to kill you! look i need your help, i have to do something to-to repel this woman! wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
hey, I have been married 3 times
no-no-no I have seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. what is your secret?
look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue.
oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?
yeah, well what about you? you were not you know, so hot in college either. after everything he said, he would go "ba dum bum chessh"
yeah, monica does not like that either, maybe i should stop doing that.
oh y'know what, girls do not like it when i start talking about science.
that is not specific to girls.
this is great, this is great, what else, what else?
uh, they do not like it when you correct their grammar.
and they do not like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
they do not like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
man, I am so lucky i have monica.
(nonchalantly) I am never going to find love again.
hey phoebe, can i talk to you for a second?
sure
okay, um, i...(phoebe walks into her room.) all right phoebe look, i just wanted to say that I am sorry. ok? i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you.
so, what should you have done?
well, i-i should have told you the truth.
uh-huh, which is...?
well, y'know, the reason i did not want to go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...(starts flapping her arms)
so?
well, it is embarrassing. people were looking at us like we were crazy.
why do you care?
because they are people.
but people that you do not know and will never see again.
yes, but still. they are people…with eyes.
well, i did not get embarrassed running next to miss (panting). but no, okay. no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. yeah, okay. you are uptight.
i-i am not uptight—hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! listen, i am not uptight, man.
that is okay rachel. I am not judging you; that is just who you are. me. I am more free y'know? i run like i did when i was a kid, because that is the only way it is fun. y'know, i mean did not you ever run so fast you thought your legs were going to fall off? y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan? (rachel looks confused) the neighbor's dog.
okay, is this lamp in the same place?
who cares? i repel women.
(blocks the door) no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! you can not come in here! r-r-r-r-ross is naked.
what?!
(whispers) what?!
(to ross) i could not say that i was naked because she is allowed too see me naked.
why does anyone have to be naked?
why is ross naked?
i-i had to show chandler something?
naked?
yeah-yeah i uh, i have a uh, a guy problem.
is it the same thing that chandler had?
look, uh, just come later, we will get everything squared away and you can come back later.
okay, listen, there is still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye!
bye! thank god
dude, what did you have?
look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we got to get everything back into its original place.
(realizes something) the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
that is perfect! that is brilliant! (starts going through the photo album)
so really, what did ya have?
uh, do not you mean "for whom?"
pizza, heh, its not like i never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
all right, all right, let us just get this out in the open okay? you are hot. I am lovable. clearly there is a vibe going on between us. but, we are roommates and it is a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
no, no, no, I am telling ya. imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? so the question is, what do we do?
oh!
oh! i see what happened. it is because i was trying to repel you. right? believe me, you would feel a lot different if i turned it on.
oh, i do. (gives her the joey-love look.) how you doin?
what?!?!
oh dear god!
(runs into phoebe.) hey!
hey!
oh honey, I am so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
see? and you do not care if people are staring, it is just for a second because then you are gone!
gone! i mean its amazing pheebs. i feel so free and so graceful. (turns and bumps into a mounted policeman and falls) hey! look out for the horse! sorry! (runs off.)
is it okay for me to come in now?
uh-huh
why is everything different?
bye! (runs out)
no, i do not see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (forced laughter)
well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and do not even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
okay look, do not...do not be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and I am sorry, I am very sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.
it is okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
do you want me to be afraid of you?
of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it is, it is a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but I would never expect you to worry about that.
really?
of course!
oh well you are the best. you come here to me.
all right, hold on okay? first thing's first. (gets her cleaning gloves on) okay, now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
so it said that by the year 2030, there will be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
that is so janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we are doing right now? you and i, we are interfacing.
ba dum bumb cheshhh!
phoebe?
yeah?
look at that guy by the window, wow!
he is awfully short and i think he is talking to himself. and to be completely honest, he is not that good in bed.
oh, what is wrong with me lately? i mean it is like every guy i see—i mean look here. (points behind them) look at that guy for example, i mean normally that is not someone i would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I am feeling, all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
wait a second! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
yeah.
this is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
really?! so this has happened to you?
oh absolutely yeah! oh and keep in mind, now, i was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms i was-i was thrice as randy.
wow! this explains so much! last weekend, i went from store to store sitting on santa’s lap.
yeah. yeah, i remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of evander holyfield from a foot locker.
ah.
yeah.
well, y’know what? i go see my doctor tomorrow, I will ask her about this. maybe she can give me a pill or something.
yeah. yeah, that is what you need a good…pill.
hi!
oh great! hey-hey joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and mona ice skating?
oh uh, ordinarily i would love too, but i am just swamped right now. (brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but does not move from his chair.)
hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
I am missin’ picture time?! (jumps over to look, ross glares at him and he retreats.)
(sitting down next to ross) y’know she has a face ross!
wow! that is a good one! wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
(pause) together? like-like to people?
okay. (not happy about it.)
uh sure, sure.
bye.
(to ross) congratulations! you just got married!
i know. can you believe that?
wait, I am-I am sorry. what is the big deal about a holiday card?
married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! what-what is she crazy?!
hey-hey-hey, hey that is your wife you are talking about!
honey, you remember my boss doug right?
yes, hi.
i did not know you and carol were getting divorced, I am sorry.
no leg-chewing for us sir.
i can not think of anything we are doing. (quietly) why can not i think of anything we are doing?
okay, I will see you tomorrow! (doug exits.) just so you know, we are not seeing him tomorrow. (chandler wonders why.) i-i cannot spend another evening with that man. do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
no.
that is because he was not invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
oh yeah. boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture does not it?
hey!
huh. wow, this is great.
well, we-we have not said that to each other yet, but i guess its okay to say it to other people.
a hundred?! well, i-i guess I will take a—mona, uh…i-I am not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
sending out a holiday card, together, i mean i just do not know if we are really quite there yet.
yeah.
huh.
hmm…
let us do the card!
the card! i think we are there!
really?! i mean, even with the card?
hi!
oh, okay. hey, can i ask you a question? was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? y’know who I am talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers… (stops when she realizes it was her.)
yes, you are.
oh, really, really good. but enough about me, come on! where-where are you from? what do you do?
right! right! i-i actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? do you ski? or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
oh, i love to ski! how amazing is this?!
no. I am very comfortable.
no! shoot, dr. schiff what kind of question is that?!
well would you like me to lie down on the table?
do you feel it too?
hi.
oh hey! so, how did your doctor’s appointment go?
well, let us see. uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam i put my pinky in his chin dimple.
oh my god.
why did you do that?
okay, remember that little problem i was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
oh yeah, the evander holyfield phase. oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
you wish.
hey, i could have had you if i wanted you.
oh yeah? come and get it.
okay, even this is turning me on!
(entering) hey!
oh hey! hey ross! hey how is it, how is it going with you and mona? are you guys still together?
oh yeah, yeah we are moving forward. you will be getting our card!
you and mona are doing a holiday card together?
yeah, we are not just doing a card! y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
ugh! women!
i know! i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation?! huh? i mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "so, where is this going?"
uh ross? you asked me that.
hey! you were a closed book! okay? I am not a mind reader! besides, i hate those conversations. I am horrible at them. really! maybe-maybe i need kind of a gesture. y’know, something that says we are moving forward without having to talk about it.
like asking her to move in with you?
smaller than that.
making her a mixed tape?
uh, bigger than that.
give her a key to your apartment.
whoa-hello! we were closer with the mixed tape.
all right. have you said, "i love you?" you could say, i love you.
yeah i-i do not-i do not think I am quite there yet, but i could say i looove spending time with you.
no, we hate that.
that is a slap in the face.
forget it. i-i—y’know what? I will just have the conversation. I will just say i like things the way they are, and hope for the best. what do you think rach?
i think, if it was a little colder in here i could see your nipples through that sweater.
oh uh, as it turns out, we can not do it. monica has to work.
oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
it is the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
well now-now you are just talking crazy.
because uh…we-we…we split up. monica and i split up. hold me.
y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. can i choke ya?
oh no-no-no, monica would freak. (doug looks at him.) but to hell with that bitch.
here we go. mona umm, i think it is time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
aw, we-we are so…(motions that they are connected.) so umm, well i-i-i like you and i-i love umm, y’know hanging out with you. and i mean-I am having a lot of fun. (he pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there is not.)
i mean, there is no point in spending time with someone if-if it is just fun. it is got to be, it is got to be going somewhere right? so where-where is it going? (pause) ah! that is-that is the real question. and-and the answer is…is it is going somewhere…fun. now i-i know what you are thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you are-you are not getting any younger. no i mean—no not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. i mean—you-you look like you are getting younger by the second—what is your secret?
well, well to sum up, we are having fun, you look young.
but that is not enough. so… so…here is a key to my apartment. (hands her his key.)
really.
you gave her a key to your apartment?!
not just a key, i gave her the only key! i am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
(entering with some guy) hey. ooh ross! how did the conversation go?
oh great, i live on the street.
where?! (ross exits.)
hey!
hi! okay, monica, rachel, this is my friend roger.
hi roger.
so umm, I am going to get us some drinks. (to rachel) would you help me out?
yeah. (they go into the kitchen.)
umm, he is here to have sex with you.
what?
you are welcome.
phoebe no!
it is okay, he is a virgin.
rachel umm, i was just talking to this guy and i think he will have sex with you.
yeah, okay let us leave these two alone.
no! i do not care what my hormones are doing, i am not going to just do it with some random guy!
fine! then you tell roger because he was really looking forward to this! (phoebe exits.)
oh that is all right sir, and that is just one girl.
it is a hand. it is a thing you use as a jack and coke holder.
oh no-no-no!
okay, and oh I am going to need a bunch of extra keys. apparently i give them away for no reason at all.
no. that guy is.
I am trying to tell you i made you a mix tape.
i love you!
hi honey I am home.
from the tequila factory?
it was awful. to get out of going to dinner with doug i told him that you and i split up. so then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when i would not give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
come here. i can breath through my mouth.
y’know what the worse part was? i got to see what my life would be like without you. it was like it is a wonderful life with lap dances. please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
i promise. hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
ooh, i do not know if we are there yet.
yes. hi, I would like to order a pizza. okay, can i ask you a question? is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? very ambercrombie & fitch. (joey enters.) I will call you back.
who was that?
it is just the pizza place.
you hung up on the pizza place? i do not hang up on your friends.
I am sorry honey, I am just having a, having a rough day.
oh, what is wrong?
oh you really, you really just do not want to hear about it.
then why did i ask?
okay, it is just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I am just finding myself…how do i put this umm, erotically charged.
is that college talk for horny?
yeah. so y’know, i have all of these feelings and i do not know what to do about them, because i can not date like a normal person, which is fine because i do not need a relationship, i mean all i really want is one great night. just sex, y’know? no strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that i feel comfortable with and who knows what he is doing. for just one great night, i mean is that really so…hard…to find. (looks at joey.) so how was your day?
good, i uh, i saw a pretty big pigeon.
well, i got to get up early and it is almost seven of the clock.
yeah, i got to, i got to go to my room too.
okay, good night!
good night. (they both enter their rooms.)
(entering) i can not do it!
(entering) i did not ask you to do it!
you are rachel!
you are joey!
you are my friend!
right back at ya!
but plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
and so bad. i do not even know what you are talking about because i did not ask you to do anything!
i know!
do you want to do it?
no!
all right, me neither! i was just testing you!
that is the end of this conversation!
this conversation never happened!
never happened! good night!
good night!
get back in there! (rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
hi. listen, I am sorry about that whole thing with roger. it really was not right, and i, and i want to make it up to you, so umm, i brought you something that i think you will really enjoy. (goes into the hallway and returns carrying the evander holyfield cutout.) now, this is just a loan. okay? I am going to, I am going to want him back. so… (looks at him longingly) I am going to go now. (exits.) (pause) (entering) I am sorry, i thought i could do it and i can not! (she grabs the cutout and exits for good.)
(reading the comics) eh..., i do not, i do not know.
what?
well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
yeah.
oh, sure! do you need me to train somebody new?
(to chandler) eh, do you believe that?
(thinks about it) yeah?
just admit it chandler, you have no backhand.
excuse me little one, i have a very solid backhand.
shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
i was shrieking... like a marine.
all right here. watch me execute the three ‘p’s of championship play. power. (swings the racquet) precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits sarah who is started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)
you broke a little girl’s leg?!!
i know. i feel horrible. okay.
(reading the paper) says here that a muppet got whacked on seasame street last night. (to ross) where exactly were around ten-ish?
well, I am going to go see her. i want to bring her something, what do you think she will like?
maybe a hello kitty doll, the ability to walk...
I am going to get back to retraining. (gets up)
all right, see you guys. (starts to leave)
look out kids, he is coming! (ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)
and i got to go sell some christmas trees.
have fun. oh wait, no, do not! i forgot i am totally against that now.
what? me having a job?
no, no, i am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to joey) hey, how do you sleep at night?
well, I am pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. hey, phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. those trees were born to be christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
really?
yes. yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it is the only chance to see new york.
gunther, gunther, please, I have worked here for two and a half years, i know the empty trays go over there. (points to the counter.)
huh. well, y'know that is actually a really good idea, because that way they will be closer to the mugs. y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
gee, i always heard them talk about that, i just always thought that it was a club they went to. oh god, I am, I am sorry. (walks away)
so, this must be kind of neat for ya, huh? i mean, your dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, do not have to sell those cookies anymore.
wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
i think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india.
huh. well, good luck to dad. say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
yeah.
four hundred, huh? well, that sounds do-able. (starts to get out his wallet) how much are the boxes?
(puts away his wallet) and what is second prize?
well, that makes sense.
yeah, sarah, anything.
hi, I am selling brown bird cookies.
no, hi, I am, I am an honorary brown bird (does the brown bird salute.)
ah, well, it means that i can sell cookies, but I am not invited to sleep-overs.
no, please, please, um, it is for a poor little girl who wants to go to spacecamp more than anything in the world.
okay, okay! I am going. I am going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)
all right!!
(walking up to joey) hey.
hey. what, what are you doing here?
well, i-i thought a lot about what you said, and um, i realilized duh, all right maybe i was a little judgmental. yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...
look now, phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their christmas....
destiny.
sure.
yes.
all right.
okay. (one of joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) yikes! that one does not look very fulfilled.
oh, that is, that is ah, one of the old ones, he is just taking it to the back.
you keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
so, what happens to the old guys?
well, they go into the chipper.
why, do i have a feeling that is not as happy as it sounds? (joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) no! nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)
(to the guy operating the chipper) hey! hey!! (makes the ‘cut it’ motion with his hands)
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite christmas characters, santa, rudolph, and baby jesus.
all right, I will take a box of the cream filled jesus’s.
wait a minute, one box! come on, I am trying to send a little girl to spacecamp, I am putting you down for five boxes. chandler, what about you?
ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
no, but ah, there is coconut in the hanukkah menoreoes. i tell you what, I will put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
mon?
all right, I will take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that is it. i-i started gaining weight after i joined the brown birds. (to ross) remember, how dad bought all my boxes and i ate them all?
ah, no mon, dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. but ah, y'know I am sure that is not going to happen this time, why do not i put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the rudolph’s.
no.
oh, come on, now you know you want ‘them.
do not, do not, do not, do not, do not do this.
I will tell you what mon, I will give you the first box for free.
(she reaches out for it and stops) oh god! i got to go! (runs out)
come on! all the cool kids are eating ‘them! (chases after her.)
(sitting down next to chandler) I am training to be better at a job that i hate, my life officially sucks.
look rach, was not this supposed to a temporary thing? i thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
well, yeah! I am still pursuing that.
how... exactly are you pursuing that? y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
well, I am also sending out.... good thoughts.
if you ask me, as long as you got this job, you have got nothing pushing you to get another one. you need the fear.
the fear?
he is right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
well then how come you are still at a job that you hate, i mean why do not you quit and get ‘the fear’?
because, I am too afraid.
i do not know, i mean i would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... oh, i just do not want to be 30 and still work here.
yeah, that would be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
yeah.
can not i just look at the handles on them?
okay, fine. gunther, y'know what, i am a terrible waitress, do you know why I am a terrible waitress? because, i do not care. i do not care. i do not care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, i do not care where the tray spot is, i just do not care, this is not what i want to do. so i do not think i should do it anymore. I am going to give you my weeks notice.
gunther, i quit.
(to joey) does this mean we are going to have to start paying for coffee? (joey shrugs his shoulders.)
....and 12, 22, 18, four... (chandler starts laughing) what?
i spelled out boobies.
(comes up and starts looking through ross’s cookie supply) ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. where, where are the mint treasures?
ah, we are out. i sold them all.
what?
monica, I am cutting you off.
no. no, just, just, just a couple more boxes. it-it-it is no big deal, all right, I am-I am cool. you got to help me out with a couple more boxes!
mon, look at yourself. you have cookie on your neck.
(covers her neck) oh god! (runs to the bathroom)
so, how many have you sold so far?
check this out. five hundred and seventeen boxes!
oh my god, how did you do that?
okay, the other night i was leaving the museum just as ‘laser floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying i sold 50 boxes! that is when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ so i ah, started hitting the nyu dorms around midnight. i am selling cookies by the case. they call me: 'cookie dude!'
(entering) okay, stop what you are doing, i need envelope stuffers, i need stamp lickers.....
well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
me! on my computer.
well you sure used a large font.
eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
hey-hey-hey that is funny! your funny chandler! your a funny guy! you want to know what else is really funny?!
something else i might have said?
i do not know, i do not know, were not you the guy that told me to quit my job when i had absolutely nothing else to do. ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!!
sweetie, calm down, it is going to be okay.
no, it is not going to be okay ross, tomorrow is my last day, and i do not have a lead. okay, y'know what, I am just going to, I am just going to call gunther and I am going to tell him, I am not quitting.
you-you-you do not want to give into the fear.
you and your stupid fear. i hate your fear. i would like to take you and your fear....
(entering, interrupting rachel) hey! i got great news!
run, joey! run for your life! (runs out)
what? rachel, listen, have you ever heard of fortunata fashions?
no.
well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. so, you want me to see if i can get you an interview?
oh my god! yes, i would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, joey.
not a problem.
thanks.
and now for the great news.
what, that was not the great news?

christmas cookie?
okay, and ah, this one here is a douglas fir, now it is a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
(running up carrying a tree) wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! no, no, you do not want that one. no, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)
okay but that is why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it is christmas destiny, otherwise there going to throw it into the chipper. tell him, joey
yeah, the ah, trees that do not fulfil their christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
pheebs, you got to stop this, i working on commission here.
(entering) hey, guys. I am here to pick out my christmas tree.
well look no further, (shows her the dead one) this one’s yours! ahhh.
is this the one that i threw out last year?
all right y'know what, nevermind! everyone wants to have a green one! I am sorry, I am sorry, i did not mean to get so emotional, i guess it is just the holidays, it is hard.
oh honey, is that ‘because your mom died around christmas?
oh, i was not even thinking about that.
oh. (turns and looks at joey, who gives a ‘way-to-go’ thumbs up and smile.)
(to the girl sitting next to him) hi there. how many, how many ah, did you sell?
hey now! that was an accident, okay.
what is a scrud?
i do not have too. i can just look at you.
(to himself) not nice enough.
(to himself) good for a scrud.

well, i lost. some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the you.s.s. nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
(to rachel, who is entering) hey! how did the interview go?
oh, i blew it. i would not of even hired me.
oh, come here sweetie, listen, you are going to go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. (she glares at him) that is not how that was supposed to come out.
this is the worst christmas ever.
y'know what rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
i can not! it is too late! terry already hired that girl over there. (points to her) look at her, she is even got waitress experience. last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... (starts to cry) swans.
that word was swans.
well seeing that drunk santa wet himself, really perked up my christmas.

it is like ‘night of the living dead christmas trees.’
(answering the phone) hello? (listens) yeah, this is she. (listens) oh! you are kidding! you are kidding! (listens) oh thank you! i love you!
sure, everybody loves a kidder.
(hanging up the phone) i got the job!
oh, god bless us, everyone.

(to ross) should i tell her i ordered tea?
no.
um, excuse me, everyone. ah, this is my last night working here, and i ah, just wanted say that i made some really good friends working here, and ah, it is just time to move on. (at the counter gunther starts to cry and runs into the back room) ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment i will never have to make coffee again.
I am, I am sorry you did not get to go to spacecamp, and I am hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. presenting sarah tuttle’s private very special spacecamp!! (opens the door and chandler and joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)
oh come on! here we go! (picks her up and puts her in the chair) stand by for mission countdown!
(simulating an echo) ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... (chandler hits him in the back of the head) okay, blast off!
I am an alien. I am an alien.
oh no! an asteroid! (throws the soccer ball off the back of joey’s head.)
so the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and i have to narrow it down to six.
food? uh-huh give me! (she hands him the paper.)
so did monica tell you about this great band called the swing kings that we are trying to get to play at the wedding?
since when are you into swing music?
oh since forever! i used to go all over town listening to bands!
chandler.
gap commercial. (to monica) so did you book them? did you call?
i will.
do you want me to call?
no, I will do it. you just stick to your job.

staying out of the way.
this is impossible monica, why do not you just pick all 15? (hands back the paper.)
there were only twelve.
oh yeah, i added three.
what are peanut butter fingers?!
oh yeah… (he mimes sticking his fingers into a jar of peanut butter, scooping some out, and eating it off his fingers.)
(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) well hello! she is cute! should we uh, go try to talk to her?
sure! that is one of the great things about being engaged. I am not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
uh yeah! let me, let me get that for you.
(exhales) i got it. (he lifts the box and grunts under the strain.) (calmly) so hi, I am uh, I am ross and this is my friend chandler. (he shyly waves.)
kristen, hi. are you uh, new to the area, ‘because if you are…I would love to show you around sometime.
ah.
y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (kristen crinkles her nose at that.) before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (he stops when he realizes what he is talking about.)
(to ross) smooth.
umm, say you are going to be starving after all this moving. what do you say i take you to dinner tonight?
yeah?
great! uh, let me take this up for you. (the box he is holding.)
oh no-no, after you. (she grabs a chair and heads upstairs.) (when she is gone.) oh my god! (he drops the box and chandler can not pick it up.)

oh, my fiancee wants the swing kings.
ooh, is that spelled with a ‘c’ or a ‘k’? oh my god! it does not matter; they are both great!
oh y’know what? y’know what? now that you know what you want you should go to kleinman’s and get it half off. this place is so overpriced.

(checking her out) hi! you uh, movin’ in or movin’ out?
oh uh, can i give you a hand?

okay. yeah. (she leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) yeah, I will grab this one. (he follows her upstairs.)
(to phoebe) so this is brooklyn.
all right, listen up. there is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. now, this is what you are looking for! (holds up a picture of it.) memorize it! when you locate the dress, blow on these. all right? (she passes out whistles to them.) three short blasts, when you hear it. come running.
okay.

all right.
oh they are pushing! they are pushing!!
(to rachel) hey! do not be a baby!
well i…
(coming back out) hey! rachel! come on!!!!
no. no. not it. not it. not it. (checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (to the woman) do not crowd me! (finds it) this is it! this is the dress! oh my god, it is perfect! (she takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I am sorry, this one’s taken! (the other woman tugs harder pulling monica through the rack.) whoa!
megan!
you came?!
this is my dress!
yes it is! you saw me wearing it!
what? you freak! you would not even have known about this place if it was not for me!
maybe i do! I am pretty feisty! (she blows the signal.)
(hearing the signal) I am coming! I am coming! (she takes off towards the signal and almost knocks another woman over.)
okay! (runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) hey! (heads the other way and hears another blast.) what do i do?!! (she runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. she moves the dresses out of the way to find rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) what are you doing? (rachel does not stop.) did you find the dress? (rachel will not stop so phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)
did you find the dress?
no! you got to get me out of here phoebe! these bargain shoppers are crazy!
i—we got to get monica. (she starts to leave.)
no! you got to hold my hand!!
oh my god!! (she grabs rachel’s hand and drags her towards monica.) excuse me! excuse me! (she is knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)
(handing phoebe the dress) go! go! go!
(seeing who is trapped) hey…
now!!!!!!!! (rachel runs off and monica gets up to follow her.)
so ross, how was your date the other night? did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she would like to go out again.
huh.
yeah in fact, I am going to go call her right now. and I will make sure to tell her my friend chandler says… (he mimics the shy reaction chandler did.)
(entering) hey chandler!
hey!
listen, sorry i did not stop by last night but i had a date.
uh joe, when it is one of the clock in the morning and you do not come by? that is okay!
well check it out, i was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
really? right across the street?
yeah!
when’d you meet her?
two days ago.
excellent! y’know ross met somebody too!
oh yeah?
(returning) hey.
hi! how did it go?
oh great! we are going out again saturday. but i just found she is also seeing some other guy.
(sarcastically shocked) really?! joe? what would you do if you were in ross’s situation?
well, i sorta am. i mean yeah, I am dating this girl who is also seeing another guy. but, i do not know, I am not to worried about it.
well you should not be. believe me i would not want to be the guy who is up against you. (chandler laughs.) i mean that doofus is going to lose!
so this is nice! i wish i did not have to go, believe me! but unfortunately i have to. (he gets up and joey moves over next to ross.) oh uh, by the way, what is the name the girl you are dating?
bye! (exits.)
well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
obviously! so, how do we decide?
well now let us-let us look at this objectively, i think i should date her…
(not buying it) uh-huh. uh-huh. or, or I am the one who dates her.
that is interesting, but check this out. i date her…
yeah-yeah i like that but just to go in another direction…
okay, okay. this can go on for a while.
yeah well we should order some food then.
no joey! look why do not, why do not we just let her decide? okay? hey-hey, we will each go out with her one more time. and-and we will see who she likes best.
(smiling) that sounds fair.
maybe I will take her to that new french restaurant down the street…
ah yeah—wait a second now! look we are going to have to set a spending limit on the date. i do not have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
well sorry, that is what i do on dates.
all right, well i guess I will just have to do what i do on dates.
so let us decide on the spending limit…
yeah. uh, (thinks)…a slice…(thinks)…six dollars?
i was thinking more like a hundred.
okay. can i borrow 94 dollars?
oh…
i know. hand me a tissue. (monica hands her one.)
you are out of diet coke.
hello? (listens) what?! (listens) you what?! (listens) hey you listen here missy! (listens) wh—(she is hung up on.)
what?!
that was that girl megan! she booked the swing kings on the day of our wedding and said that i could not have them back unless i gave her the dress!
(gasps) does that mean carcass is available?
what am i going to do?! that is the dress! that is the dress! wh…chandler wants the band. what do i do?
well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
how?
you are out of toilet paper!
(entering) hey!
hey! what is up?
i just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.
oh thanks!
yeah. what time are you meeting her?
we have 8:00 reservations at grammercy bistero.
wow, that is in like 20 minutes. you would better get dressed.
i am dressed.
oh. well good! (to himself) for me. (he picks up a jar of lotion.) what is this? did you give yourself a facial?
i have an oily t-zone!
okay dude! (finds a receit.) hey you uh, you sent kristen flowers.
that is right.
you spent a hundred dollars. that is the limit. you are screwed!
uh actually, i sent the flowers before the actual date. so techincally, technically i did not break any rules. thanks for stopping by though.
oh-oh! so that is the way it is going to be huh? yeah i can break the rules too y’know!
oh yeah? what are you going to do?
i do not know.
why am i not surprised?
y’know what ross? I am not going to let you get away with this!
i do not think you have much choice.
well we will see!
bye-bye!
yeah bye-bye! (exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) hey! so just a light layer?
yes. yes. just here (runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (runs his fingers across his forehead).
joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (he goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
yeah, swing music is so out.
phoebe, he is got to be in the room for that to work.
(returning) what are you guys talking about?
well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the swing kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.
yeah, i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. and now I am not saying that there is any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that is why they got divorced.
but i love swing music!
yeah but the swing kings? y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—they just stop living.
look all i know is when monica and i went to see them, we had fun! and there is another reason too.
well, what is the other reason?
i do not want to say.
well you have to because maybe it is stupid.
well it is just while monica and i were dancing to them it was…the first time i knew that…you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with.
oh crap!
so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
yeah.
oh yeah it is fine. i guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
(entering) kristen?
hi!
oh i like this place. and technically, technically I am not breaking any rules so i…
hi!
hi. (they shake hands.) it is nice to meet you. i used to have a friend named joey. i do not anymore.
yeah. so…
sure! i would love to wait with you guys! thanks! (sits down.)
so joey umm, you look familiar. are uh, are you on tv or something?
that is right! that is right, do not you play a woman?
a woman in a man’s body.
much better.
so y’know ross it is funny ‘because, you look familiar to me too. have you ever been married?
well yes, yes i have. in fact umm, just the other day kristen and i were talking about how I have been married and how i have a son.
that is right! wait no, ben.
so you have just married the one time then?
well umm…
yes. and another time after that. boy I am getting hungry! hey joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
(laughs that one off) yeah. so uh ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
no. it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
wait a minute! were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
hey you leave marcel out of this!
fine! have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a tv cabinet vd boy?!
monkey lover!
when do you think we lost her?
probably around gonorrhea.
hi, honey! I am home!
(from the bedroom) do not come in here!
why? do you another boyfriend in there or something?
no! we only mess around at his place!
y’know it is funny i started it but, now it is scary me. so could you come out here please?
no, I am wearing a wedding dress.
oh you got a wedding dress? that is great!
yeah but I am not keeping it.
well then why can not i see it?
oh. i guess you can. okay but; i-i have to return it, so you can not like it.
okay i promise. I will-I will hate it. (she enters.) wow! you-you look…hideous.
really?
yeah, that is like the most ugliest dress I have ever seen. wh-why do you to return it?
oh because it does not…really fit. oh by the way, i-i booked the swing kings.
oh that is great! great! thanks! but that dress i mean it is like yuck! it is terrible! it makes me want to just rip it right off of you!
okay! but you can not rip it. well, maybe a little.
okay!
(entering) hey guys! do you want to look at the song list for the wedding? (they ignore her.) guys?
(without turning around) i thought you were going to be gone all day.
all right? what is going on?
I am sorry. I am sorry. i-i should probably leave you girls alone. (she heads for the bedroom.)
yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we are going to have younger looking skin!
yeah! (monica goes in the bedroom.) y’know, she could use a little…(whistles that she needs to do what they are doing.) (something happens on the game.) oh nice shot!!! (they all cheer.)
(entering) hey! I am all packed and ready to go!
oh, that is right! (to emma) daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today. we are going to a conference in barbados, right?
mmh-mmh.
(to emma) can you say barbados?
barbados!
ok, i got to say. i mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! uh! and I have a surprise, uh... i had to pull some strings but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! that is right! (he gives them their passes) this babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
yeah ross, i mean... we are excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we are going to want to do, you know, "island's stuff".
i think david would probably want to hear a few lectures.
oh, right, because he is a scientist!
no, no, because, you know, he is been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he will die.
ok, we got to go, yeah? so, we will see you guys tomorrow.
all right, let us do it! 5 hour flight with charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
it is a blanket joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
(very excited) look at all these paleontologists!!
i know, there are going to be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! (a woman goes towards them)
(to charlie) i think I have been recognized, this happens all the time!
that... never happens...
wow! this is very flattering, uh...
uh, uh... sure! uhm... "dear..." (he takes the notepad)
"... sarah. i dig you", uh? "doctor ross geller".
yeah, oh and sarah... I would like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, professor wheeler, a-and this is joey tribbiani.
no, god, no! no! no no, I am an actor. you would probably recognize me from a little show called "the days of our lives".
dude, it is just "days of our lives"... there is no the.
(thinking he is kidding) ok, ross! it is... it is fun, yeah! no, i-i play doctor drake ramoray.
you do not own a tv? what is all your furniture pointed at??
david, can you help me?! I am trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air.
(to chandler) see?
yeah, that is the same as "it has something to do with wind".
alright, I am going to go pick up a few things for the trip.
oh, i should go, too. oh, now... tomorrow do you guys want to share a cab to the airport or should mike and i just meet you there.
mike?? who is mike?
that is right! oh, yeah... well, I have totally forgotten about I am! ah! that is-that is... a blast from the past!
really, it does not mean anything. i mean, you know, monica refers to chandler as richard all the time!
(upset) she does?
(pinching her) let us get you out of here!! (they go outside)
at least you took me down with you!
I am sooo sorry!! i just... i keep thinking about mike! I am crazy about david, and we are having so much fun together. why-why do i miss mike? that is-that is going to go away, right?
i guess, in time.
yeah.
i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone.
you just did it again. chandler, your feelings for chandler are certainly gone!
i would not read too much into it.
david, let me stop you there because i think i see where this is going. I am not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you want to advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
seriously, we are going to do this?
oh, because his penis was too big. (he notices that david is not amused) oh, I am sorry, that is the kind of thing i do. (pause) they broke up because mike did not want to get married. hey, what if you just let phoebe know you would be open to marriage?
what?
i did not mean now...
well, you are welcome! glad i could help.
david, I am pretending to read here!!
yeah! how you doing? yeah alright!
hey, hey! you said you are going to wear a thong, where is the thong?
you really should have been more clear about that!
hey!
hey!
(excited) you are never going to guess who i just saw downstairs!
oh! ah! eh... britney spears!?
yeah, she never misses these conferences! (then to charlie) no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz!
yeah... what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz?
you could say: "hey kenny, how come you are not britney spears?" (looks at ross matter-of-factly)
(to charlie) ready to go?
wha...? you are going to go now? i thought we could hang out?
yeah.
(smiling) will you wear a thong?
oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
(a little embarassed by their conversation) I am good, i have dinner plans (moves away from them).
yeah, yeah. I have got tons of stuff i could do. I am going to hit the beach, go swimming...
uh, joe, have you looked outside?
no, why?
oh man!
i was not going to swim, i was going to dig a hole! (removes a small plastic spade used by children to play on the beach from his backpack)
wow! that mike thing was interesting! i do not know what is going to happen with phoebe and david.
(smiling cheekily) i do! want a hint? huh? "i do" (monica looks confused, so chandler repeats) "i do".
ok, I am sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
david is going to propose to phoebe.
what? (looks very shocked) why?
be-because, we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married.
chandler, we have talked about this. you are not supposed to give people advice! now could not you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
i did! a penis one! look, just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?
they have only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike! she will say "no", david's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again.
man, that is some bad advice!
oh! hey! thank god you guys are here!
hey! hey what is going on?
everything is upside down here! it rains all day long, nobody watches tv and ross is famous!
alright, i do not want to alarm anybody, but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
ok! when i go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
that is why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!
come on, I will show you guys where to check in (joey, chandler and david leave)
(to chandler) oh, honey, can you make sure we get a king size bed!
(shouts after david) oh! david, get one for us too! oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! and with mirrors on the ceiling!
(shouts to chandler) and make sure our room is not next to theirs (points to phoebe).
ooh! you guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it is such a romantic place. that is all, i just wish i could (looks at joey who is at the check in desk) share that with a guy.
not joey.
not joey, no, i was just lusting after chandler.
yeah, right!
tonight?! (looks at the ring) is not an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? (squints at the ring to emphasize how tiny the diamond is) oh, there it is!
(slaps him on the shoulder) nice! (goes to monica)
monica, can i talk to you for a sec? (pulls her away from phoebe and rachel)
ok!
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!
see what happens when you give people advice? i hope you told him not to?
that would be advice!!
ok fine. I will handle this. (goes to phoebe who is talking to rachel) phoebe?
yeah?
(looking very serious) i need to talk to you.
are you leaving "the supremes"? (monica and phoebe go to one side)
wow? really? that is fantastic!
what are you serious? you want to marry him? wha... what about mike?
oh, ok, you want me to marry mike? alright, well, let us just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. i can just see it: "mike, do you take phoebe..." (gestures with her hand as if someone is covering her mouth and tries to shout "no! no!") you know, it is every girl's dream!
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
sure! look, ok, bottom line: i love mike... david! david. i love david. do not look at me that way, roseanne rosannadanna!
by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century.
oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because i will not be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. (someone knocks on the door, ross goes to open and it is joey, rachel and chandler).
hey guys!
the chocolates are not here yet.
damnit!
oh, is it on the computer, cuz I would love to give it a read...?
if you want to check your email, just ask! (chandler tries to look offended)
(offended) what? (pause) may i?
(looking out the window) what is with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
it is not the time charlie.
(at the laptop) oh, no, no, no dear god, no!
oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot? (chandler looks annoyed at him and joey leans in to him) oh! secret teapot?
your computer, i do not know wha... everything's gone!
wha... what do you mean? (goes to the laptop)
it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.
what, oh my god. what did you do?
someone i do not know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.
why, why would you open it?
well, it did not say "this is a virus"!!
what did it say?
nude... (ross looks at him)... pictures of anna kournikova. I am so sorry.
what... what am i going to do? my speech is gone, chandler!
it is not gone! i mean, I am sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy, right?
no! i do not!!
well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
it is really gone?
yep! I would like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
i just feel awful.
yeah, well you should! i mean, nude pictures of anna kournikova? i mean, she is never even won a major tournament!
well, i tried billy jean king, but... (ross glares at him) you know, you and monica have the same "I am going to kill you" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her... (ross continues to glare at him and chandler leans in as if he is going to kiss ross)
get out! (chandler runs out)
you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
well, what do you do?
well, i usually go... play tetris on somebody else's computer.
i can not believe this. i can not believe this is happening. i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! ok? i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i going to say?
i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions.
i do not think that your monologue from star wars is going to help me right now, joe!
wha... what you really think we can do that?
hey do not worry about that! i mean, ross needs you! and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can.
ugh.
alright, ok, let us do it. (ross sits down at the desk and they all gather around him) uhm, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era, the breakup of pangea, hello! (rachel and joey look confused) and then, there is the... eh... there is the overview of the triassic.
oh, oh! any chance any of this happened in a "galaxy far, far away"? (ross turns aroud and glares at him. joey and rachel decide to leave).
ok, mike, enough is enough, now you love phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "i never want to get married" thing and step up!
this is monica! I am phoebe's friend. listen, phoebe is back with david and he is going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but i know she really wants to be with you!
i... I am sorry, did you say something? i can not hear through all this damned hair! (tries to move her huge hair away from the phone, in vain)
you do not tell me what to do! i tell you what to do! just call her. she is at the paradise hotel in barbados. and while I have got you, you have got curly hair. what do you do in humidity? (mike hangs up the phone) damnit!
(sarcastically) well, i hope you are happy!
(pretending not to sense the tone) oooh! i hope you are happy too, honey!
phoebe is going to say "yes" to david. see, that is what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
phoebe is going to say "yes"? that is, that is great!
no it is not, b'because she is still in love with mike!
and there is not chance that will work?
no, i called him. it is not going to happen.
(pointing at her) oooooooh! meddler! meddler!
well, if you had not meddled to start with, i would not have had to go in there and meddle myself. now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
this vacation sucks!!
I am so bored! stupid rain, we... we can not do anything.
well, I have brought some books. we could read.
hey, it has not come to that yet.
(stopping the waiter) hey hey hey! do not mind if i do!
hey rach, do you feel like going to a convention?
we can not. we are not pharmacists!
(walking to a table with many badges on it) i know we are not, but (he picks up a badge) frank medeio and... (picks up another badge) eva trorro... womba...
(picking up another random badge) kate miller?
kate miller it is. (he picks up the kate miller badge and sticks it on rachel's breast)
and... that is the most sex I am going to have this weekend.
in that case should i make sure it is on real good? (he does so, repeatedly tapping on her breast and stroking it)
thank you. (they walk away)
yeah, that is it?
oh my god, we did it! (he sits beside her and skims through her notes excitedly)
yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products. this is amazing, thank you, thank you so much. (he leans in, and they look at each other for a moment) that is a pretty necklace.
hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne? (he goes to get the champagne)
oh my god, i love you.
that is ben, my son from my first marriage.
yeah.
no. (they clink glasses and drink)
(embarassed) oh, it was... it is complicated, you know? she... she was... eh... gay.
ok, odd thing to get excited about!
hey! high-five! (they high-five)
my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. she did not get any fitter.
i know! it is like, if you knew, why did not you tell me, you know? i mean, call, or leave a note: "hi, i just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
and then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
(embarassed) me neither.
well, who knew? pharmacists are fun.
i know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
not enough pills in the world, rach. what about you, you are the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
well, let us see. there was a really big guy that i was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
but what about back home, anything going on there? anybody you like?
(takes a sip from her drink, embarassed) no.
there it is, you are blushing!
no, I am not blushing, I am sunburnt! from, you know, the rain.
you like someone. tell me who it is. who is it? (tickles her a little)
no.
tell me who it is.
joey! (she walks away; joey goes after her teasing and tickling her)
come on who? who do you like? tell me. you are not getting away that easy. who do you like, who?
joey, come on! it does not matter, you know, it is not like anything's going to happen.
what? why not? rach, who can you not get?
oh! (pause) ok. ok, you really want to know who it is?
(eagerly) yeah, who is that?
do ya?
yeah.
right, of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech?
yep, we got it, we got it. (to charlie) thank you so much.
alright, hey look, and this is not over, because i really want to know who...
later! la...
yeah. (they leave)
ok. see you, bye.
good night.
night.
i can not believe she is going to say yes to david. she is clearly in love with mike.
you know, it is very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
oh my god, he is going to do it now. please, i cannot watch this, let us go.
i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk? (doing david) "uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh..." spit it out, david!
sure, ok, yeah.
oh my god, mike!
no, mike's here.
it is the humidity!
what are you, what are you doing here?
you are the most incredible woman I have ever met. how can i lose you? (phoebe looks very flattered) now, i do not actually have a ring...
i would not brag too much about that thing, big guy.
(smiles at him happily for a few seconds before answering) no!
i love you. but i never needed a proposal from you. i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
david, I am so sorry, I am sorry.
yeah, i might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
yes! (they hug)
(to everybody) because of our meddling! alright?
oh, are not this nice? it is so quiet, i could just lie here all day.
i know (she snuggles to him)
(walking in hurriedly) open your drapes! open your drapes!
I am so glad we have got adjoining rooms!
the sun is out!
hey! remember when i had corneas?
ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I will get the magazines and the lotion.
ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
nooo!
damn it!
(from across the wall) walls are pretty thin, guys!
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I am so jealous!
finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: gigantosaurus, argentinasaurus...
(to a paleontologist sitting next to him) not to mention the cold sores.
and that is just the herbivores. I am not even going to discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
(to the one sitting next to him) really?
but all kidding aside, in much the same way that homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus...
he said "erectus"!
no, he really said it.
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus...
erectus?
homo.
(concluding his speech)... in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century. (pauses) thank you!
oh, thanks guys!
oh!
(with a frozen smile on his face, realizing something is wrong with jarvis) ok... now... now we are just holding hands! (pulls his hand away)
all right! well, uh... (to monica) we are going to hit the beach?
yeah!
(to ross, in a flattering tone) it was really... great!
oh, thank you so much!
yeah, and so funny!
oh!
(puzzled) ok!... all right, thanks! thank you so much, you guys! (to phoebe) oh, i can not tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
(skating over, embarrassed) ok!... uh... excuse me? yeah?
hey! (she turns to him) well...? (in expectation)
yeah?
oh, i can not tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! i mean... uh, did you know you were (giggles) mouthing the words along with me?
no, it is ok! made me feel like a rock star!
(joking) I would better not found you naked in my hotel room!
(realizing his joke was not so good, but still giggling) look, i took it too far!
(her hair bigger then before) i can not believe it is raining again! oh, it is so unfair!!!
well, on the bright side, now you will not have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. (grabs a drink and notices that the two men are upset) not you guys. you got it going on!
so, what are we going to do today?
(pleasantly surprised) ping pong? (to chandler) honey, they have ping pong! let us play!
i do not think so!
(disappointed) why not?
because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it is cute, others disagree, and I am lying!
I am not always that bad!
oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?
(hesitatingly) i punched you...?
and...?
... phoebe...?
... and...?
i clunked your heads together!
hey! (stands up) as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya! (smiles ecstatic)
(disappointed) oh... oh, but that is ok, I will find someone else to do it... I will do it alone, but... i do not know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
(interrupting her) hey! do not worry about it! it was fine! i ended up having the best time with rachel! i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on ross's speech... (pulls a face)
(bewildered) oh! oh, well! at least we are both having fun!
yeah! a little bit, yeah...
yeah... i think we do... (sighs, with folded arms)... about what?
c'mon guys, it will be fun!
all right, all right... I will play if we do not keep score!
but then how do we know who wins?
nobody wins!
so, we are just four losers... super!
I am not playing with you.
yeah, I am out.
(smiling) ok!
mike, you do not know, you do not know what you are doing!
she gets crazy! this scar (points to his forehead) is from pictionary!
sure! got to!
aww!
(nearly whispering) oh dear god, there is two of them!
hell, yeah!
(to phoebe) did you know this about him?
no idea! i though he was soft like you!
how much were you thinking?
make it fifty!
(nearly shouting) one thousand...
(interrupting her) ok!
(going through her pockets) no... (to chandler and phoebe) either of you girls got a quarter?
honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
(picks up a coin from her bra) monica, you call it.
heads! no, tails! he-he-heads!
tails!
(angry) ow, what are the chances!
ha! my point!
(smiling proudly) he was a lawyer!
oh! weather bitch! (turns the tv off)
it is open! (joey walks in) hi, joe!
(downhearted) hey...
(worried) what, is everything ok?
uh... charlie and i broke up.
nooooo, why?
oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
(laughing) oh, that is crazy!
no, it is not, we have nothing in common!
... yeah, it is true.
i mean, she should be with someone like... ross! you know what i mean, he uses all those big words too! man, smart people are dull!
(pretending to be offended) what, hey!
(laughing sarcastically) ok, rach!
i feel so stupid, you know? why... why do i keep going after the wrong girls?
w-what are you, what are you talking about?
oh, c'mon, i mean, there is you, then there is charlie, and it is like... (sighs) what the hell is my problem? oh! (he falls back on the bed)
ok... uh... maybe you are not always going after the wrong girl...
(sitting up again) I am telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me!
yeah, I am not talking about her...
but then who? the waitress i went out with last month? (gives her a meaningful look)
you know? forget it!
(stands up) no-no-no-no, no! who, who were you talking about?
no, i-i-i-i do not, i actually do not know who I am talking about! so!
ok! all right, well... I am going to see if i can get a room for the night and I will... I will see you later!
yeah, sure!
you like me? (shuts the door)
(nearly whispering) ok, let us not make a big thing about this!
(shocked) that is a huge thing!
not working with me, joe! here is the thing: lately i have been having thoughts (pauses) musings, if you will!
what... for how long?
only like a month!
(outraged) a month??
what the... dial it down! (joey goes to sit on the bed) listen, ok, and maybe they are crazy thoughts, but sometimes i do, i have, I have been thinking about... you know, us! (looks at joey, who is totally distraught) ok, dial it up a little!
(stands up) i just have one question!
shoot!
(desperate) what the hell are you doing???
i do not know, I am not trying to do anything, it is just, we have such a good time when we are together, you know... i mean, are not you just a... little curious... (insinuating) what that would be like?...
uh, am i curious? i mean, i am as curious as... as... george!!
(puzzled) who...?
curious george (see link)! you know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
oh yes, of course, i remember him!
yeah, he had a paper route.
yeah, he did! (smiling) oh, see, this is what I am talking about!
no, i know, yeah i know we are great but rach no... this... this can not happen!
but can it... just... happen a little bit?
(charmed, but then recoiling) no, no! it can not happen at all!
but why, why not?
because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? (in a trembling voice) i have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did i ever say no! (sighs) i could not do it to ross!
but that was not going to stop you before!
i know, i know! but I have thought about it a lot since, and it just would not be right... (painfully) I am sorry...!
(regretful) I am sorry, too! (they look at each other sadly, then she recollects, and puts her hands over her eyes) oh god! i should not have said anything!
no! no-no-no-no-no-no! hey! hey, we will be fine! li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
it is not a big deal!
no big deal!
it is so not a big deal!
yeah! I will see ya later! yeah!
ok!
ok, i...
aaahhhh!
ooh! I am sorry! i think, i think, that may have missed the table!
ah, yeah!
ah, yeaaah!
ah yeaaaah!
(to phoebe) do you really find this attractive on him?
(looking at mike) oh, yeah! (turning to chandler) are you telling me you... you are not even... a little turned on by monica, right now?
i think this is the first time in our marriage that I have felt like the more attractive one.
c'mon mike, you can beat her! knock that dog off her head!
oh, damn it!
(pointing at mike and shouting) i sleep with him!
(threatening) do not get too cocky! remember i won the last one! oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
no, no, nooo!
okay-dokay, you have each won a game and I have lost what is felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner.
best out of three?
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
(to mike) serve the ball, chump!
(to mike) ok mike, better come back mike, better come back.
ooh, well. ah, i kind of have got a lot on my plate right now, not that i would not love a weekend in the country with a strange man. (mr. oberblau giggles)
get out!
yes, please! (they move and sit down on a sofa) so, what is going on?
oh my god, wh-what happened?
i knew that was him!
(holding her hand) hey, you ok?
oh, professor clerk we are kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
(standing) ok, gentlemen! please! are not we a little old for this? i mean, we are scientists, right? we are academics. and most importantly i... you-you will have to catch us first. (he starts to run away with charlie). go, go, go! (the paleontologists starts chasing them)
(exhausted) ok, look! enough is enough!
no, i have just to have two more points to beat him!
monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you have already proven you are just as good as he is, now we have missed our dinner reservations, so now let us just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
i can not just walk away! I have put in four hours!
but...
look! you knew this about me when you married me! you agreed to take me in sickness and in health. well, this is my sickness!
what about the obsessive cleaning?
that is just good sense!
(in pain) aww! (she holds her hand, moaning like she is biting back a scream)
you ok?
no, no, no. honey, I am ok. shake it off! (she shakes the wrist and it is more painful) oh, no! no shaking, no shaking! ooh! ooh! (pause) oh my god! i can not play!
mike wins?
i can not believe it! (pause) i lost!
no, you did not.
what?
because I am going to play for ya.
you can not do that!
ok, we are taking that paddle home, mister.
(to chandler) honey, you do not have to do this.
(in a loving voice) yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it is important to you then it is important to me, because i love you.
but... you suck!
(still in a loving voice) you are welcome, sweetheart.
all right mike, let us get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins.
oh my god! you are good!
it is like watching porn!
and that is... how... it is done!
(to chandler) oh my god. that was so amazing! when did you (pause) hold on! i almost forgot (she turns to mike) loser! (back to chandler) when did you stop sucking?
i never sucked, i actually did not want you to know how good i was!
why?
i do not know.
this is so great! now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
that is why!
hi.
yeah. the bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. (pause) you know, we as a group are not the coolest.
i do not think they saw us.
(apparently unruffled) oh. can i... can i ask who?
i think i know too but I have been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
I am sorry... we... we can not.
i mean, you just went out with my best friend, and i just think it would be a really really bad idea. (pause) or-or not! (they kiss passionately)
what?
hey!
hey!
listen, do you guys think i have a chance with janine?
honey, we have been through this before!
yeah. do not do this to yourself.
she is made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
well all right then, i guess i should not get to excited about the fact (excitedly) that i just kissed her!
you serious?!
that is great!
really?!
yeah well, we will see.
you kissed her.
oh we kissed it up real nice.
so you kissed her, so what happened after that?
i came over here to tell you guys.
so she is just waiting over there for ya?
okay. (they kiss.)
okay. (they kiss.)
okay, I am all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? (she kisses him on the cheek and starts to leave.)
bye. (janine exits.)
have you kissed her yet? it is awesome! i could do it forever! y’know what? she-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
i am so glad you said cooks.
i know.
(entering) oh hey rachel, sweetheart? you have got to tell the post office that you have moved. okay? we are still getting all your bills and stuff. (hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
oh-oh, pottery barn! (grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to chandler.) you can throw the rest away.
I am not your garbage man. I am your mailman.
monica look! look-look-look! here is that table that i ordered. (shows her the picture.)
you got it from pottery barn?!
yeah! it is an apothecary table. does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
a pharmacist. (rachel mocks him.)
rach, phoebe hates pottery barn.
i hate pottery barn too. they kicked me out of there just because i sat on a bed!
you took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
(indignant) i was tired!
phoebe hates pottery barn?!
yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. she thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
well this has story behind it! i mean they had to ship it all the way from the white plains store.
it is got to be one of a kind. y’know like umm, y’know uh, what is that god awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
hey! i made that for her!
you made pottery?
yeah! i made it of this fruit bowl i found in the garbage.
I am telling—if you put that in her apartment you will never hear the end of it.
okay fine! I will-I will just tell her it is an antique apothecary table, she does not have to know where it came from. oh! look at this little drawers! oh look-look it says that it holds 300 cds.
ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…
…so then the farmer says, "that is not a cow and you are not milking it." (everyone laughs.)
i am so glad you guys got together, chandler and i are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
look at us, we are a couple of couples!
yeah.
and chandler i can not believe i let you pay for this one. (they hug and he whispers in his ear.) thanks man.
so do you guys going to come over tomorrow? I will make that pasta thing i was telling you about.
oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
joey, you do not have too!
nope-op! i insist! (he hugs chandler again and whispers to him.) you get the wine right?
yeah all right. (they part.) okay, good night guys.
see ya tomorrow!
tomorrow!
what?
what-what is wrong with monica and chandler?
blah?!
uh, they are like my best friends. are you saying we can not hang out with them? ‘because that would kind of be a problem.
i guess.
if you want, I will sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
hey!
hey!
(sees the table) ooh, what a great table! where-where did you get it?
guess!
umm, a flea market?
ha! see, i knew, i knew you would get it on the first guess. is not it cool! it is an apothecary table.
wow! oh you can just imagine that this is where (she is opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
ohh, yes.
y’know? ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
almost.
how much was it?
it was only 500 bucks.
500 bucks at a flea market?!
oh, okay see i thought, i thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.
oh no.
yeah no, i mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.
a dollar?
and fifty. so it was like one and fifty dollars.
ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
yeah.
well, what period is it from?
uh, it is from yore. like the days of yore. y’know?
yes, yes i do. god, oh it is just perfect! wow! i bet it has a great story behind it too. did they tell you anything? like y’know where it was from or…
yes! that i know, this is from white plains.
(gasps) white plains. oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
hey! we are here!
hey!
(seeing his new table) ohh! oh my god!
you like it?
oh no!
it is my new apothecary table!
ross! phoebe’s going to be here any second, she cannot see this!
well why not?! she will-she will love it! it is the real thing! i got it at pottery barn.
i know you did! i bought the same one! and if she sees your table she is going to know that i lied to her. i told her ours was an original.
why did you do that?
because she hates pottery barn.
she hates pottery barn?!!
i know! i know, she says it is all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (ross looks at his table.) so come on, she is going to be here any second! can we please just cover this up with something?! please?
what? no! no! i am not going to hide it from phoebe—ooh, although i did get some great pottery barn sheets! (gets them.)
ooo! oh, i forgot they made sheets!
uh, yeah! i still can not believe she hates pottery barn!
ross, get over it! it is not like she hates you.
yeah but pottery barn! y’know what i think? it is just she-she is weird. y’know it is because she is a twin. twins are weird.
ross, she is not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
huh. y’know what is not one of a kind? a twin!
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey!
ooh, phoebe’s here! okay, let us turn out all the lights and we will just watch the movie!
okay. hey—ooh, cool sheets! (notices the sheet over the table.)
oh, you like it? you want to know where i got it?
sure!
he got it a flea market!
you bought your sheets at a flea market? ross come on, you got to loosen the purse strings a little.
hey!
hi!
the dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. this is so exciting.
and here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (hands it to him.) you were also going to buy monica flowers but you could not afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
thanks. thanks, but uh actually it is just going to be me again tonight.
what happened to janine?
oh, she is uh-uh really sick.
oh that is too bad.
yeah, she is been in there all day (points to her room), uh high fever, a nose problem… phlegm! phlegm! phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
‘kay!
that is funny, i saw no phlegm.
no-no, she really is sick!
then why-why is she going to a play?!
uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
joey! why is janine not coming over for dinner?!
well uh, she did not want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I am so sorry.
well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, monica, are too loud.
(loudly) what?!! (quietly) what?
so she was just pretending to have a good time last night? she was lying to our faces?!
ugh, i can not believe this! i mean, who is she to judge us? we could not have been nicer to her!
and i am not blah, i am a hoot!
i know! i know! come on, please-please you guys, do not-do not be mad. I am sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! y’know? and it was our first date! plus, she is really sick!
no, you sh—no you said you made that up!!
i know, but do not you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
eh, they are both good. i generally just go with, monica’s drunk again. (monica glares at him.)
come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? she will come around i promise.
of course we will, come on we got to make dinner.
okay.
(from the hallway) i do not like that woman!
(shouting) i can hear you!
i am loud!
that is funny. (phoebe puts her feet up on ross’s table.)
hey pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new…(on rachel’s glare)…old sheet?
oh sure! (she goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her which spills the wine.) noo!
ohh!!
my apothecary table!!!
what?!
noooooo!! (phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)
ross, where did you get this?!
i got it at pottery barn!! okay?!
oh my god, phoebe, pottery barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
wow! oh my god, well if they have ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
oh yes.
well this does not even smell like opium.
of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! and thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
oh ross, calm down, I will give you the 80 cents. (ross glares at rachel)
okay, one more time.
chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
perfect decibel.
(loudly) i know!!!
(entering) hey!
hey.
so uh, what are you guys doing?
oh nothing, we are just talking. y’know, blah-blah-blah.
look, come on you guys, you said you were going to try! all right look, i came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and janine.
well, I would like to but, (extremely quietly) I am not sure we have time to go.
ha-ha, very funny—look! i do not know what to do! i really want you guys to get along. just please come to the movie with us. i mean you owe me!
we owe you?!
that is right! i helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. huh? i helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and i looked like an idiot! and i was humiliated. and i only made 200 dollars!
we did not give you any money! (chandler is motioning, "no!")
you do not think i know that!
…see i can not decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the sahara desk, or the parker console table.
wow! i did not know that there was a pottery barn up here.
i know, i know. i went a little crazy.
a little? your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. oh look at that! the ornamental bird cage! large!
(entering) hey!
hey.
(sees ross) oh ross no. be careful, that is very old! okay? early colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
(glaring at rachel) fascinating.
(gasps) another amazing find! wow! oh i bet this has a great story too!
oh it does, it does! it is a room separating apparatus from colonial times.
ah!
hmm, a lot of this stuff is from colonial times. hey, what are some other time periods rachel? (she glares at him.)
well there is yore. and uh, y’know, yesteryear.
yeah no, I am telling you rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—and i think that you should. you should, you should ask rachel to help.
oh honey he does not need my help.
oh, come on! i think he is ready to get rid of, what did you call it? the cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
really?! (to rachel) hey, y’know what? since you have such a great sense of what i need, uh ooh, here is-here is 60 bucks, why do not you take phoebe down to that colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
(not sure of what to do) y’know what? i do not, i do not think phoebe really wants to come.
no! i do want to!
oh, she does want to.
she does want to.
yeah!
pheebs, i do not know what to say. i guess the flea market was just better last time.
well at least i got these sheets for ross.
yeah.
uck, look at this! pottery barn, yuck!
yeah, y’know what? do not look at it. (realizes the display is their living room) seriously, do not look at it. (tries to pull phoebe away.)
no! look-look! there is the coffee table they stole from us!
ugh, those bastards! let us go.
that fan kind of looks like ours. and the birdcage and the…wait a sec! this is our exact living room!
no! no! no! no it is not! no it is not! come on! phoebe, ours is totally different! i mean we do not have the… (looks desperately for something different.) we do not have the…that lamp! and-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.
oh my god. this is where you got all our stuff, pottery barn! oh my god!
okay! okay-okay look—no i did, i just wanted this stuff and i know how you feel about pottery barn. just… come on do not be mad.
no-no-no, but i am mad! i am mad! because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! and it is all sitting up in my living room and all i can think about is how i do not have that lamp!
well then honey, buy the lamp! hey, we have that 60 bucks from ross.
i can not! i can not! unless… well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if i did not buy that lamp?
what?! no! I am not going to move out!
but are you saying that you would move out if i did not buy that lamp?
(gets it) oh. yes! i would so move out!
okay then i do not have a choice! i have to buy that lamp!
that is right!
but at least the apothecary table is real.
well, this-this-this was great. did not everybody have a great time?
that is totally understandable.
do not worry about it.
oh yeah!
absolutely!
oh well then, good night!
good night! (they go into their respective apartments.)
see? eh, was not that fun?
(bursting in) i knew it!! y’know, you are not so quiet yourself, missy!
and I am blah? listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (imitating her) "oh chandler, i just lost myself in the moment."
(steps up and points at her) all right! you and me! let us go! right now!
all right! all right! enough! enough! enough!! enough! (to chandler and monica) you two go home! i-i-i got to talk to janine! (they start to leave.)
(to monica) y’know i think you can take her.
(to janine) you would better hope i do not see you in the hallway!! (they exit.)
all right, uh, we have got a little bit of a problem here. these people are my friends; you can not treat them that way.
i know! i know! and I am going to talk to them about it. they mean so much to me. they… they are like my family. if you guys are going to be fighting all the time, i-i… i do not think we can be together. it just, it just can not work. it can not. (starts to break up) I am very upset.
yeah! yeah! that would be very helpful! yeah. (he opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)
what did i tell you about the hall?!
well, i know that would make joey happy, so, i would like that too.
now come on. (they hug like men.) well, I am glad we worked things out.
okay.
bye. (leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
(hearing that) that is it big girl! (hits janine in the butt with the garbage bag) come on!
(chasing her) you would better run!
did you hear that?
yeah uh, what am i going to do?
yeah, I am sorry man. (pause) you want to go watch?
yeah! (they head downstairs.)
hey!
how ya doing?
hey so, did uh, did she move out?
pretty much, yeah.
i cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
well, when it is not right, you know it.
you okay?
yeah! yeah. I will be all right.
y’know what would cheer you up?
what?
I am giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, i think you should come.
(laughing hysterically) you are right! that did cheer me up!
y’know what? it seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
i know. ross is getting married.
phoebe is, making people.
everybody’s doing stuff!
and we just sit here. i mean if i die the only way people would even know i was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! look, we have to do something. okay? something huge!
(snaps his fingers) we could climb mt. everest!
no-no, not something stupid, something huge.
no-no-no-no-no, i saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! we could totally do that!
why not?! i mean it is just, it is just climbing! it is just, it is just steep!
yeah!
we are going to everest! okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on everest!
(entering) hey!
hey!
what-what is up?
we are going to climb mt. everest!
yeah baby!
really?! i looked into that. yeah, but, i mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. and, you would die!
(dejected) yeah, well…
we could get that everest video though.
yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
and while we are down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? die hard! (chandler’s excited.) oh, y’know what? i just remembered, that everest thing is only available through mail order.
(dejected) oh, well…
so you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
yeeeeahhhh.
yeah. yeah.
but I will tell you something. one of these days we are get off of our buts and rent die hard again!
yeah we are!
ohh, god, nobody likes him, and he is so cheap, he would never fly to london in a million years. yeah, invite him? hey, did i do these neat enough? (hands her some envelopes.)
yeah?
sure. why not?
yeah?
wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we should not invite her?
yeah sure.
huh? yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
i do not want to be single, okay? i just... i just- i just want to be married again!
and i just want a million dollars! (he extends his hand hopefully.)
rachel?!
oh god monica hi! i just went to your building and you were not there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
okay, everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor. (to rachel) this is everybody, this is chandler, and phoebe, and joey, and- you remember my brother ross?
hi, sure!
hi.
you know you probably did not know this, but back in high school, i had a, um, major crush on you.
i knew.
you did! oh.... i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother.
i did.
oh. listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out? sometime? maybe?
yeah, maybe...
okay... okay, maybe i will...
 see, i see.... big passion in your future.
really?
i do.
oh ross, you are so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
it is never going to happen.
hey, i have a question. well, actually, it is not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
okay.
okay. umm, for a while now, I have been wanting to, um....
ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind ross]
yes, yes, that is right...
oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind ross] look at it!
what? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] ow!
all right, listen, missy. if you want this cart, you are going to have to take me with it!
(to ross) yes! did you see that?
you were incredible! brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
i could not have done this without you.
ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I am fine, I am fine.
you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
(hurt) what?
i was doing great with julie before i found out about you.
hey, i was doing great before i found out about you. you think it is easy for me to see you with julie?
the point is i... i do not need this right now, ok. it, it is too late, I am with somebody else, I am happy. this ship has sailed.
alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright ross.
fine.
because i do not need your stupid ship.
good.
good. (ross leaves)
ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I am doing something i actually care about. this is the first time in my life I am doing something that I am actually good at. i mean. if you do not get that...
no, hey, i get that, okay, i get that big time. and I am happy for ya, but I am tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! okay, i do not know what to do anymore.
well neither do i!
is this about mark?
(shocked) oh my god.
okay, it is not, it is not.
oh my god. i cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, ross, no, you are, you are, you are making this too hard.
oh I am, I am making this too hard. okay, what do you want me to do.
i do not know, i do not know. urrrgh! look, maybe we should take a break.
okay, okay, fine, you are right. let us ah, let us take a break, (goes to the door) let us cool off, okay, let us get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
no. (ross is standing in the doorway.) a break from us.
yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend i told you about last night? (he is frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. oh, i found it!!
yeah!
oh, thank you. (she goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) hey, hey. (opens the door, sees rachel, and hides chloe behind the door) rachel!!!!
hi. ohhh, you got my message.
yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
so what do you say? can i be your girlfriend again?
yes, you can, very much.
(seeing the thumbs up) ahhhh!! (hugs rachel tighter.)
(opening the door) y'know what, i want you to leave! get outta here!
no!!
just get out! now!!
no!! no!! i want to stay. i want to talk about this.
okay! all right! how was she?
uh-oh.
what?
was she good?
do not answer that.
come on ross! you said you wanted to talk about it, let us talk about it!! how was she?
she was...
awful! horrible!
she was not good. not good.
she was nothing compared to you.
she, she was different.
ewwwww!
uh-oh.
good different?
nobody likes change.
what? okay, okay, okay, okay.
 ...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you have grown. y'know?  i mean my mom never thought this would work out. it was all, “once a cheater, always a cheater.”  ooh, i just wish we had not lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
we were on a break!!!!!!!
you seem to really like her.
yeah, i really do. yeah, but what am i going to do, i mean we-we both agreed that it was going to be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through monica’s photo albums, i mean you do not do that if you are just in it for two weeks.
you think?
yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you are sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
hey, you are right.
yeah.
ohh, this is soo amazing! i can not believe my brother’s getting married! and in london! it is so romantic!
(taking apart the invitation) hey, pretty smart! tissue paper! you are at the wedding, you have to cry, "handkerchief?" "no-no, i got my invitation."
oooh look! is not this adorable, ross let ben address mine!
(entering) hello!
hey!
hey!
hey! hey, did you get your invitation to ross’s wedding?
(sarcastic) noo.
do not worry man, i get to bring a guest. we will show him.
I am so jealous you are all going! i can not believe i never knew that you can not fly in your third trimester!
i did not know that.
i never knew that either.
i knew that! (they all look at him) i sooo did not know that, but you should see your faces.
(entering) hey guys! what is up?
heyyy. (they all try and hide their invitations.)
we are hanging out.
what is this? is this ross’s wedding invitation?
see, maybe that is the one we should have actually hidden.
oh, no! no you guys! come on, you do not have to do that! I am happy for him! i am! i really—I am-I am happ—I will work on it.
I am sorry honey.
yeah.
rach, you are going to come though are not you?
oh, honey, i do not know. i…
this is not one of those uh, y’know "if she does not come, we-we do not, we do not come?" right? because i already bought my ticket…
you know what would be real weird? is if you were not there. just say you will think about it, okay?
no, I will think about it. yeah.
who is this from?
oh, that is ross's.
oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) oh my god. he remembered.
remembered what?
it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can not believe he remembered!
oh, it is so pretty. this must have cost him a fortune.
i can not believe he did this.
come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
what did you just say?
(stuttering incoherently) f-hah.... flennin....
oh.... my god.
 (seeing ross come off the plane with another woman.) oh my god.
but we have not seen each other since then. well i land in china, guess who is in charge of the dig.
julie! julie, is not that great? i mean, is not that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
oh, that is so sweet.(listens) no, no, ok, you hang up. ok, ok, one, two, three.(he does not hang up and motions for rachel to be quiet.) well you did not hang up either.
 she did not hang up either...
 ok, no, no, you hang up. you, you, y—(rachel grabs the phone and hangs it up for him.)
(on phone) ross, hi, it is rachel. I am just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I am really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...i am over you. i am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (she hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
rach, i got a message from you.
oh my god. oh my god ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (she jumps the couch and lands on ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. ross has a confused expression on his face.)
you are over me?
ohhhhhhhh god. (climbs off his back)
wha... you are uh, you are, you are over me?
ohh, ohh.
when, when were you... under me?
well, basically, lately, I have uh, I have uh, sort of had feelings for you.
ok, i need to lie down.
he broke up with julie. well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
really?
really. it is always been you, rach.
oh, god.
I have no idea, could be. listen, I am sorry i had to work tonight.
oh it is ok. you were worth the wait, and i do not just mean tonight.
ah, oh god. oh, honey, oh that is ok.
what. oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
gunther! gunther. gunther, please tell me you did not say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place.
y'know, hey! you are the one who ended it, remember?
yeah, because i was mad at you, not because i stopped loving you!
you still love me?
noo.
what does this mean? what do you, i mean do you want to, get back together?
noo! maybe! i, i do not know.
what?!
i just, i feel, i-i just...
y'know i can not believe i even thought about getting back together again! we are so over!!
(starts to cry) fine by me!! (he opens the door and traps chandler behind it)
and hey! just so you know, it is not that common! it does not happen to every guy! and it is a big deal!!
i knew it!!!!
oh my god.
you know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
oh.
you know what, you guys, we do not have to watch this.
shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
oh, dad, turn it off.
lookin' good mr. cotter.
i can not go to my own prom without a date, i can not, it is too late.
if you are not going then i do not want to go either.
y'know what?  i think we have seen enough, let us turn it off.
ok, fine, well I am not going to watch, alright.
(walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on the endtable) okay dad.
(to ross) i can not believe you did that.
yeah, well.
see, he is her lobster.
(seeing the decision) nooooo. you are really not going?
yeah. it is just going to be too hard. y’know? i mean, it is ross. how can i watch him get married? y’know it is just, it is for the best, y’know it is, it is… y’know, plus, somebody is got to stay here with phoebe! y’know she is going to be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
you do not have a car. and your license expired.
i know. (starts to cry) yeah, see, there is so much to do and i have so little time to do it in.
all right, check it out. check this out. it says here that there is a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (reading from the book.) "it is almost as good as being there."
it is better! you can not go to a museum in your underwear!
well, you could, but... probably just the one time.
i bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a vcr in our hotel room... we would never even have to go outside!
if we do that, we got to get die hard.
oh-ho! i bet the british version is gooooood!
wow, it is like a dirty math problem.
I am sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
well, that is really a different question.
well, there was that one time that monica and rachel got together.
excuse me, there was no time!
okay, but let us say there was. how might that go?
does anybody need more coffee?
yeah, I will take some.
hey, there is a dog out there!
oh, that is so unfortunate.
what?
cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
(entering from bedroom) okay, I will be back in just a minute. oh, phoebe I am sorry that i left lipstick marks on the phone.
you did not leave lipstick marks on the phone.
oh, then it must have been you. bye. (leaves)
(angrily) bye-bye! (to ross) that is why i moved out.
hey, y'know while we are on that, when are you going to tell my sister that you do not live here anymore.
i think on some levels she already knows.
phoebe, she does not know that you sneak out every night, she does not know that you sneak back every morning, and she does not know that you have been living with your grandmother’s for a week now.
okay, well maybe not on those levels.
(entering, with a goatee) hey.
hey.
I am never going to find a roommate, ever.
why, nobody good?
well let us see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that is plural. the spitter. oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. nice to meet you, chandler bing bing! great apartment chandler bing, bing!
so how many more do you have tomorrow?
two. this photographer, who seemed really dull. and this actor guy, who I am not sure about, because when he called and i answered the phone ‘chandler bing,’ he said ‘whoa-whoa, short message.’
(entering) ross (who has his foot on the coffee table), foot on the floor or come over no more!
(to phoebe) sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.
what?
i have to go. yeah, carol should be home by now, soo...
umm, how is it going with you guys?
oh, better, actually. y'know i-i-i think i finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.
oh, really?
yeah, y'know how i have you guys, well she does not really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, susan something, and they really hit it off, and i-i-i think it is going to make a difference
soo, ah, eric, what kind of photography do ya do?
yes, that is cool. because i have models here y'know......never.
well, listen i ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, i think you are chances are pretty good. (eric offers to shake hands) all right. (chandler hugs him.)
(running around the apartment pointing out things) bedroom. bathroom. living room. this right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, (opens door) bye-bye.
do not you ah, do not you want to ask me any questions?
sure. ummm. what is up?
well, ah, I am an actor. I am fairly neat. i ah, i got my own tv. oh, and do not worry I am totally okay with the gay thing.
what gay thing?
ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I am totally cool with that.
well okay jerry, thanks for stopping by.
hi.
hey!
hey, mon.
hey-hey-hey. you want to hear something that sucks.

chris says they are closing down the bar.
no way!
yeah, apparently they are turning it into some kind of coffee place.
just coffee! where are we going to hang out now?
got me.
(to bartender) can i get a beer.
hey, did you pick a roommate?
you betcha!
is it the italian guy?
um-mm, yeah right!

oh yes, and that is what i want a roommate that i can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.
oh look, the pool table’s free. rack ‘them up. I will be back in just a minute. get ready for me to whip your butt.
okay, but after that, we are shootin’ some pool.
(sitting at a table with some of her friends) (to waitress) oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. hi. my friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh i ordered a rum and diet coke, which i do not think this is.
that is all right. (to her friends) i mean hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
ummm, i think it is time to see the ring again. (holds her hand out and they all scream)
yeah, i know.
oh, i do not know. well maybe it is just the idea of barry for the rest of my life. i do not know i think i feel like i need to have one last fling, y'know, just to sorta get it out of my system. (chandler is listening in very intensely)
I am serious, i really, i think i need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that i see.
excuse, i seem to have dropped my ball.
yeah, so?
(picks it up) and now I have picked it up again. (walks over to monica.)
oh my god, i went to high school with her. (to rachel) rachel! hi!
monica! look! hi! what do ya think? (shows her, her ring)
oh my god, you can not even see where the titanic hit it.
yes, his name is barry, he is a doctor, thank you very much.
awww, just like you always wanted. congratulations
thank you. so how-how ‘bout you, are-are you seeing anybody?
aww, not right now.
oh, but that is okay.
i know.
yeah.
so, I will get-get back to my friend.
oh, yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. (points at chandler, who holds up the cue ball as a ‘remember me?’ thing) listen, can we please have lunch the next time I am in the city?
oh, that would be great.
okay!
thanks.
bye!
bye! (to chandler) ten bucks says, i never see that woman again in my life.
no real-, honey, really it is fine, just g-go with susan. really, i, no, i think girls night out is a great idea. okay, okay, bye
so what are they doing?
i do not know, something girlie.
(to monica, who is entering) hey, you are early.
what are you doing with the lamp?
I am just taking it to be re-wired.
oh, well do not take it to the same place you took the stereo, ‘because they have had that thing for over a week.
no, no, mr. heckles no one is making any noise up here.
you do not play the oboe!
then I am going to have to ask you to keep it down. (slams the door in his face.)
hi, again.
hey! (goes into the apartment)
(leaving to go to work) hey!
thank you soo, much.
oh, do not thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. okay, i got to get to get to work.
you want some help with that?
oh, no thanks, i got it. (picks it up) no i do not!
whoa! are you okay?
whew! stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
it is the heat. (has her hand on his chest, and then pulls it away) and-and the humidity.
that is a uh, that is a tough combination.
do you want to come in for some lemonade?
like you would not believe. (they go into the apartment) wow! this is a great place.
thank you. just make yourself comfortable.
gotcha.
this place is really my grandmother’s. (joey starts to take off all of his clothes, while monica gets the glasses and pours the lemonade.) i got it from her when she moved to florida, otherwise i could never afford a place like this. so if the landlord ever asks, I am 87 year old woman, who is afraid of her vcr. so are you thirsty?
oh, you bet i am!
(turning around) okay, here is your penis!
oh my god!!! what are you doing?!!
you said, you want to come in for some lemonade?
so?!
whoa, ah!! we are you just going to give me some lemonade?
yeah huh!! cover yourself up!
oh right, right.
i do not believe this! when someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they want to have sex?
well usually...yeah! well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. well, sorry, i just, i thought you liked me. I am such a jerk.
it is okay. i suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone i know, but... by the way i can still see it.
pheebs?
huh?
where is your bed?
it is not in the apartment? (monica gives a ‘come on’ look) oh no. i can not believe this is happening again.
what?
okay, enough with the third degree! i-I have, i do not live here anymore.
what are you talking about?
I am sorry, i-i-i-i do not live here anymore. i-i did not know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
everybody knows!
that was supposed to be a good thing, i forget why. just listen, monica, i, do you know, okay, do you know, i could not sleep for like a month because i got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
yeah, i would have except i had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
what?!?!
okay, this is what I am talking about, this. i-i need to live in a land where people can spill.
you can spill. in the sink.
aw, honey it is not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and i love you, and i want us to be friends, and if i keep living here i do not see that happening.
i love you, too.
aww, good. (they hug) what?
what? I am just said.
no you are not, you are wondering which cushion it is.
so ah, What are you watching?
baywatch.
what is it about?
lifeguards.
well, it sounds kind of stupid... (looks at the tv) who is she?
nicole eggert. you will like her.
wow! look at them run.
they do that a lot. hey, you want a beer?
yeah, I will go get one.
no, no, no, do not get up, i got a cooler right here.
well, hello!
hey.
do you have any beers? we are out of beers.
(all depressed) help yourself.
you okay?
phoebe moved out.
right.
i do not understand, i mean am i so hard to live, is this why i do not have a boyfriend?
noo!! you do not have a boyfriend because....i do not, i do not know why you do not have a boyfriend. you should have a boyfriend.
well, i think so.
oh-ho, come here. (goes and hugs her) listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I have ever known in real life.
(all depressed) hi. where is everybody?
oh, it is already closed, chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
my marriage, i think my marriage is um, is kind of over.
oh no! why?
‘because carol’s a lesbian. (phoebe is shocked) and, and I am not one. and apparently it is not a mix and match situation.
oh my god! i do not believe it! oh, you poor bunny.
(sets out a bunch of shot glasses and starts to poor himself a drink, many drinks) I am an idiot. i mean shoulda seen it, i mean carol and I would be out and she would, she would see some beautiful woman, and, and she would be ross y'know look at her, and I would think, god, my wife is cool!
aw! hey, do you think that susan person is her lover?
well, now i do!!
I am sorry.
seven years. i mean we have been together seven years, she is the only woman who is ever loved me, and the only woman I have-I have ever....
aw, god ross. oh.(goes over and hugs him)
umm, this is nice.
i know, it is is not it?
no, i mean it, this feels really good. is it a hundred percent cotton?
yeah! and i got it on sale, too.
anyway, i should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
well, if you want to get a drink later we can.
oh yeah, that sounds great. (starts to leave) oh, and listen, it is, it is going to be....
i know. thanks. (chandler leaves)
maybe this would have happened if I would been more nurturing, or I would paid more attention, or i... had a uterus. i can not believe this!
i know no, no, y'know you do not deserve this, you do not ross. you are, you are really, you are so good. (kisses him on the cheek)
thanks.
and you are so sweet. (kisses him on the other cheek) and you are kind (kisses him on the lips)
thanks. (kisses her on the lips)
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
huh?
okay, it is okay.
oh. (they start kissing again)
wait, wait, wait.
what?
my foot is stuck in the pocket.
what?
no, i can not get it out.
well, that is not something a girl wants to hear.
no, come on do not start. (they start kissing again) ouch!
what?
stupid balls are in the way. (holds up two balls)
oh well. it probably would have been the most constructive solution.
you have chalk on your face.
huh? (the rest of the gang enters)
oh, ross you are right, i do not know why i always thought this was real grass.
hey, are you okay?
my wife’s a lesbian.
cool!!
ross-joey, joey-ross. (they shake hands)
hi.
i can not believe you came back.
do not say anything. i do not want to speak, i do not want to think. i just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
what?
oh, sorry.
um, (shyly) barry.
hey.
what is the matter?
someone on the subway licked my neck! licked my neck!!
oh willie’s still alive!
what are you guys doing?
oh, my mom called, they are going to run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we are looking for a good picture of us.
oooh, I am afraid that does not exist.
that is not true, there are great pictures of us!
no, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who is going like this… (makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. henceforth, this shall be known as the face.)
oh my god! that is the creep that you are with at the statue of liberty.
i do not know what it is, i just can not take a good picture.
(looking at one) oh, here is a great one.
yeah, I am not in that.
i know, but look at me all tan.
hey, why do not you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
that is a good idea! i bet they have one of those wind machines! y’know… (does the whole hair blowing in the wind model type poses.)
yeah that is great! next to that, chandler will not look so stupid.
chandler what do you say?
all right, but i should warn you, I am not going. I am going. (does the face while saying that last part.)
(to chandler) dude, that reverse lay-up! oh…
how about those three pointers?
amazing!
and those guys were this (doing the standard "this close" gesture) close to lettin’ us play this time too.
hey look-look, phoebe’s talking to uh, cute coffeehouse guy.
oh, you guys call him cute coffeehouse guy, we call him hums while he pees.
yes, and we call ross lingers in the bathroom.
(returning) hey you guys, hums while he pees just asked me out!
hey, i thought that guy was married.
he is! but he is getting divorced—ross! maybe you know him.
it is not a club.
phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
hey, divorced men are not bad men!
they have that on the napkins at the club.
oh, i got to get back to work.
you do not have to be back for a half-hour!
yeah but, my assistant tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. ohh! i could just spread him on a cracker.
rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? i mean y’know you can not date him right?
oh no, i know that. i know that. although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
soon he will be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
i am not going to get fired, because I am not going to act on it.
so you would not mind if he was dating someone else?
why? is he? he is! is not he? he is dating that slut in marketing!
maybe i should open a divorced men’s club.
dude that is so sad.
i could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
could i play?
oh, no sit-ups today tag?
oh, well drop and give me ten more!
uh, i-i had a drink with lunch. did those cost reports come in?
oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
(startled) ahh, hi! hi! melissa, what is up? I am just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. y’know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. what is up? (she has put on the backpack.)
no. why?

no, i am.
chandler, listen to me sweetie, i know you can do this. okay? you have a beautiful smile.
i do? (he smiles, beautifully.)
yeah! (they turn to the camera, and chandler does the face again.) all right, maybe you do not have to smile. let us try something else. let us try umm, try looking sexy.
okay. (you will have to see it, i can not describe the face he makes, but it is not good.)
or not.
hi joey! what are you doing here?
uhh, well I have got an audition down the street and i spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. (removes his hand to reveal a huge sauce stain.) you got an extra one?
yeah, sure. umm…here. (hands him one.)
great. (he does not like it.) you got anything that is not ralph lauren?
yeah, i do not think so joe.
all right, i guess this will be fine.
hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
nothing, why?
how would you feel about taking out my assistant tag? I will pay.
huh, rach i got to say it is going to take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I am not asking you to go on a date with him!
really? ‘because i could kind of use the money.
joey, just-just he-he is new in town and i know he does not have any guy friends. just take him to like a ball game or something. I will really appreciate it.
yeah, okay.
yeah?
sure, no problem. (sees something.) ooh—hey, donuts!
yeah!
okay. (he grabs a jelly donut, takes a bite, and guess what he spills all over himself. he tries to clean it up and smears it all over the shirt.)
i know. let us try a look…of far off…wonderment. okay, we will-we will gaze into our future and we will think about our marriage and the days to come. (chandler is still not getting it.) chandler! what is the matter with your face?! i mean this picture is supposed to say "geller and bing to be married," not "local woman saves drowning moron!" (the photographer laughs.) hey! do not laugh at him! he is my drowning moron!
aww! (smiles.)
that is it! take it! take it! take it!
i like this one. (points to it.) it seems to say, "i love you and that is why i have to kill you."
they can not all be bad. (to chandler) find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. ohh, there it is.
oh my god! those are my bedroom eyes?! why did you ever sleep with me?
do you really want to pull at that thread?
I am having a really good time!
ohh. no that is okay, he is a friend.
yeah, i… well y’know i-i mean i missed the-the semi-finals, so I would just be lost.
okay, do not freak out. I will go.
okay, i know. hold on. (she walks over to the couch.) hey ross?
yeah?
yeah, umm that is whitney (points), kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?
what?! no!
well okay but i have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (she holds up the tickets that kyle gave her.)
look, i do not think so pheebs. (pause) all right, I will do it. but just because you are a friend. (grabs the tickets and heads to divert whitney.)
hi ginger.
all right! i want my key back!
i do not have it!
it is right there! (points to her hand.)
ugh, okay sherlock! (hands over the key.)
look, I am sorry but you-you-you better go pheebs.
all right, well i just wanted to say thank you though for diverting kyle’s ex.
oh yeah—no—you are welcome. we will talk about it later.
okay.
hi whitney.
yep. (phoebe slams the door shut.) okay.
(to ross) kyle’s ex-wife? you were supposed to divert her not date her!
(opens the door and to whitney) hi! I am sorry, but can you give me a second while i talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
okay. (closes the door.) (to phoebe) i did divert her and we ended up having a great time! okay?
watching ballroom dancing?
yes! that is where we realized we were both super cool people!
well look-look, okay ross, kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
like what?
like she is really mean, and she is over critical, and-and—no! she will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
okay.
and! she uses sex as a weapon!
fine! thank you for warning me. at breakfast I will be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
you are still going to go out with her?!
yeah!
well, did not you just hear what i said?!
pheebs come on! i mean, consider the source! of course her ex-husband’s going to say that stuff. now, if you will excuse me…
(interrupting him) no listen to me! she is crazy!
you see? nothing is good enough for her!
hi tag! hey, so did you have fun with uh, with joey last night?
ohh that is nice.
wo-women? you mean like old women?
(pause) oh.
that is great! wow man, so joey must have really taught you some stuff huh?
yeah?
see? that is a great smile! easy. natural. now, pretend i have a camera. (chandler immediately does the face.) you are changing it!
i can not help it!
all right, all right, all right, all right, you want to know what i do when i take resume shots?
borrow money from me?
okay, first—first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. i look down (looks down), look down, keep looking down; then i look up. (looks up and smiles.) see? all right, now you try. look down (chandler looks down), you are looking down, keep looking down…
why is there jelly on your shoe?
i had a donut. (chandler nods.)
(entering) hi!
hey!
hey!
so uh, heard you had some fun with tag last night.
yeah! that guy’s all right!
yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all joey.
what?
y’know, all the women.
hey well, you can not teach someone to be good with women. y’know, that is why i never had any luck with chandler.
(pause) I am right here!
all right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it is just—and i know he is my assistant and i can not date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!
hey! no-no-no-no, you can not take him away from me! i got a great partner to pick up girls with! finally!!
I am still right here!
all right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
(shocked) what?!
i just do not want him to meet anybody until i am over my crush—and i will get over it. it is-it is not like i love him, it is just physical! but—i mean i get crushes like this all the time! i mean hell, i had a crush on you when i first met ya!
i know, monica told me.
did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
yeah. sure. (joey nods his head questioningly and rachel nods no.)
can you people not see me?! (he waves his arms around to get their attention.)
(to joey) so, will you talk to him?
i do not know rach.
oh, come on! I will give you ten free ralph lauren shirts.
one! (pause.) no ten! you said ten! you can not take that back!
i do not know. you uh, you got something for me?
ten. okay. now tag there is such a thing as to many women.
yeah, for you!
(seeing him approach) hey! there you are!
there i am!
are you okay?
yeah, joey said i uh, i needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
what?!
yeah, and then i fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to brooklyn. brooklyn is f-far!!
chandler, what were you thinking?
i do not know, but do not worry, do not worry, because i know how to take a picture now. (they get ready) okay, see? look down (looks down), look down, look down… (he falls asleep.)
chandler?
(awakens) yeah! (looks up and does the face.)
hi.
hi.
so, how are things going with crazy? has she cooked your rabbit yet?
listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and f.y.i she must have shown kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! and his response to each one was, "i do not give a tiny rat’s ass."
yeah well, maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
well, i do not think we are going to have that problem, but maybe that is just because i am not emotionally unavailable!
you think he is emotionally unavailable?
i think he can be.
well, maybe he would not be she did not bring the office home every night!
well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing new year’s eve 1997.
(angrily) i knew you were going to throw that in my face!! that was three years ago! she apologized and she apologized! what more do you want?!!
(gets up and starts to leave) we want the last six years back!!
so do we!! so do we!! (ross notices a couple has been staring at them.) I am sorry you had to see that.
hi! (he hands her, her mail) thanks, hey so uh what did you do last night?
oh yeah? another night of birdogging the chickas?
wow! i did not see that coming.
oh no, yes i do! i do! i mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying i am happier when uh, y’know?
really?
sp-spoil?
uh-huh.
well, i-I am startin’ too.
yes! hell yes!
okay.
I would love to!
(panics, turns around, picks up the phone, and pretend to talk on it) hello?! (listens) oh, yeah! (to tag) this is going to be a while. excuse me. (tag leaves and she closes the door behind him, disgustedly.) yeah!
my god!
oh, I am sorry. is that annoying? and speaking about being selfish in bed, how is whitney?
well maybe she would not have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
oh he knows! (quietly) for the most part.
both of you together?
wh-what is up?
oh just say it kyle!
what about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
oh right, because you are so capable of change.
(to whitney) y’know, he hums when he pees!
it makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
that is all right, we-we do not need you. in fact, hey I am over it already.
yeah, and y’know what? i do not give a tiny rat’s ass.
(to phoebe) I am sorry. ugh, pheebs, you were, you were right about her. y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! yeah, i hurt my back a little.
oh. y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
yeah, were better off without them.
and y’know, even if they break up again, you would better not let him in your sad men’s club!
divorced men’s club.
potato, potaato. (she is pronounces potato with the both the short and long as.)
hey guys check it out! my mom sent me the paper!
ooh, let us see it!
ahhh.
okay. (she opens it up and shows it to them.)
oh yeah, that looks good.
you guys make a very attractive couple. (the camera cuts to a shot of the picture and we see that monica is posing with joey instead of chandler.)
yeah, we look great together.
yeah, we really do!
okay.
wow! imagine what our kids would look like!
y’know, we do not have to imagine.
I am marrying her.
we will just see.
what is it hon?
i-i can not find anything that i want to eat! everything i eat makes me nauseous! I am telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! cake! (chandler shrugs, and phoebe grimaces.) no.
aww, honey I am sorry.
god! ooh! what is that smell? it is coming from the bathroom. ooh! (she goes to the bathroom.)
wow! pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
yeah?
it is me. it is phoebe. listen there is something in here i want to eat, what-what smells so good?
is it the shampoo? it is guava.
(she smells his head) no!
oh! wait-wait! (reaches inside the shower.) is it my bologna sandwich?
yes. yes. yes. i can not believe it! the baby wants bologna! maybe he wants me to eat meat? i can not eat meat!
oh, wait-wait! (reaches into the shower again.) maybe it is a pickle?!
what are you writing?
well, joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since i do not have the guts to ask him out, I am going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
oh yeah? (he grabs the pad and starts reading it.) joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (pause) never go out of style—what did you throw away?
hi guys!
hey, what have you guys been up too?
oh, we went to see a collection of victorian doorknobs and the cupert-hewitt museum.
without me?!
yeah.
i do not know how museums work in england but, here, you are not supposed to take stuff.
bye. (they kiss.)
wow! you guys seem to be having a good time.
oh yeah, she is-she is amazing. and-and she is so much fun. and! y’know what? when I am with her, I am fun! i even signed up for helicopter classes. (chandler is shocked.) she is leaving in two days, i do not have to do it.
oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
yeah, she is got to go back to london. but you know what? I have been prepared for this from the start. we both knew we had two weeks together, and that is it. y’know.
hey that is what all my relationships are like.
yes, but in ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that is it.
pheebs!
(starts rubbing her belly) hello! hello!
(angered by the rubbing) yes! i know! i know! yeah! so the baby is totally craving meat. this afternoon i tried tricking it, i made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? and i got nauseous.
maybe that is because soy-burgers suck!
being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
that is sweat. you throw up all morning, you will have that glow too.
oh, here is that trench-coat that you wanted.
yeah?
(stopping him) oh no-no, no-no, they do not want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
well, that is because of a lot of…(she imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)
i know!
oh?
well, congratulations, so do you love her?
huh. well, uh, that is uh, that is interesting. (she goes over and retrieves her note.)
oh, it is just an anti-theft device.
you need that, you need that too ‘because obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (rips up the note.)
oops, sorry. listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
what are you talking about?
yeah, what’ going on?
we have to have a surprise bon voyage party for emily. but it is actually for joshua. (starts handing out party hats.) look, he said he is not ready to date, so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside of work, and now i have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (hands ross a party hat.)
well, as much as I would like to meet josh and warn him, emily and i are not going to be here. all right? i mean, she is going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I have got a whole special evening planned. so I am sorry, no party.
awwww!
surprise!!!
well, it was all ross’s idea.
you really did not know?
why are you in here if joshua is all the way over there? (points to the living room.)
uhh, because I am trying to play hard to get. oh, quick he is looking over here, say something funny.
like what?
what-what-what is so funny?
i said, "like what?"
now that is a thinker.
okay, y’know what, y’know what? this playing hard to get thing is not working. umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (chandler does so.) okay. okay. (she does a little sexy walk over to where joshua is standing.) hi!
care for a cherry?
no? y’know, i can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
(interrupting monica and emily) so we should probably get going soon.
yeah, but we-we have to be at the four seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then the plaza for dinner.
no-no-no, no, umm, actually american surprise parties are-are-are very short. it is usually, "surprise!" and then, "oh my god, I am so surprised—good-bye!"
monica said that did she? (he squeezes monica’s knee really hardly and monica winces in pain.)
ooh, yeah. then what are you going to put on top of that?
a little salami.
ooh yeah! then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
pastrami.
oooh, yeah. you are a genius.
oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
yeah. (he goes over to her.)
up!
you changed?
yeah, i did. i needed my lucky dress.
and lucky means, more cleavage?
does for me.
ohh, god! look at him, he is so cute. i want to go over there, grab him, and kiss him! how can i kiss him and not letting him know that i like him?
oh! i know how you can get him, take off your bra.
what?
there was a seen in footloose...
flashdance.
yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl…
she was a welder.
what? were you like in the movie, or… anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. very sexy, and classy.
or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
it is not christmas!
or spin the bottle?
he is not 11!
what? you are leaving?!
yes, we have something we have to get to.
no! you guys can not leave yet! you have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
what big thing?
(spinning the bottle) so, spin the bottle works like this: i spin the bottle, it lands on gunther, so i would have to kiss gunther. (she crawls over to where gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on gunther’s face and decides not to kiss him.) all right. who wants to go first?
welcome to america. (they both kiss.)
two in a row! you have got to use your tongues now! (they kiss again.)
yay! emily!
what are the odds? what are the odds?
(stopping them) okay, that-that is enough! y’know, let us, let us let someone else play.
if you did not want to play, why did you come to the party?
okay, my turn!!
oh my god!! the baby just kicked!
it is okay! it is okay! it kicked once, it will kick again!
all right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
just a bug.
y’know it does not matter how much I am craving it. y’know why I am never going to eat meat? because it is murder, cold blooded murder.
okay.
there is a phoebe on my sandwich! (he walks away, giving the sandwich to phoebe.)
phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
i can not help it. i need the meat. the baby needs the meat.
all right look, y’know how-y’know how when you are dating someone and you do not want to cheat on them, unless it is with someone really hot?
yeah, totally!
all right. okay. well this is the same kind of deal. if you are going to do something wrong, (he grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!
feel better now?
yeah, but at what cost? six more months, three meals a day, I am going to eat like, y’know millions of cows.
hey, what if i said, i could even things out for ya, meatwise.
what?
well, i eat a lot of meat right?
yeah.
well, suppose until the baby’s born i laid off it. no extra animals would die, you-you would just be eating my animals.
joey, i can not believe you would do that for me.
absolutely! i could be a vegetarian. there is no meat in beer, right?
okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
oh my god! have you lost your mind?
no-n-n-n-no! i am finally thinking clearly. my lucky dress was not working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
rachel-rachel-rachel i-i cannot, i can not let—(pause), actually i kind of want to see what happens.
hi!
ohh, yeah, well i wanted to give emily a big american good-bye cheer. so okay! (runs into the living room) ready! okay! give me an ‘e!’
give me an ‘m!’
give me an ‘i!’
give me an ‘l!’
give me a ‘y!’
what do you get? (she throws her pom-poms to joey and phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) emily!! (tries to do another one.) emil—whoa!! (she falls in chandler’s room.) okay! so that is me as a cheerleader! ta-dum! (gunther’s the only one that claps.)
I am fine! I am fine! I am just losing a tooth, it is no big deal. i have a dentist! y’know. I am going to go put some ice on it. excuse me. (she goes over to the ice and joey and monica follow her.) what do i do now? what do i do now?
i think you are done.
okay, time to take off the bra. (she glares at him.)
(trying not to be obvious) take the bra off.
all right, come on, let us go get your coat.
oh, yeah! real fun. (she makes a decision.) y’know, this bra… really, bothers me. (she starts taking off her bra.) y’know, this used to be my bedroom. yeah. a lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. if these walls could talk, y’know what they would say? want to hear some memories? (she is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it is not co-operating.)
oh no-no-no! no, i got this all under control.
ughhhh!! forget it! (sits down heavily on the bed.) this is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
can you not look at me when i say this? (he turns around) i thought that if i could get you here, i could seduce you.
well, I am sorry, i thought you needed them!
why?!
you like me?
yeah but-but-but you liked me! oh my god, i can not believe this, all this time, i liked you and you liked me!
oh no-no-no do not say but! no-no, but’s never good! let us just leave it at, you like me and i like you.
oh, now see that is a fancy but.
but….
okay.
ohh, here you are. i was looking for you before. joshua’s gone so you and emily are free to go.
that is okay. she is still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it is too late to do any of the things i had planned, so…
oh, ross, I am sorry. i completely ruined your evening.
yeah.
well, if it makes you feel any better, i made a fool out of myself.
helps a little.
is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
yeah, have a seat.
I am so sorry.
that is okay, i mean it was just two-week thing anyway, i just did not want it to end this way, y’know?
well, maybe you did not want it to end?
what do you mean?
you seem to really like her.
yeah, i really do. yeah, but what am i going to do, i mean we-we both agreed that it was going to be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through monica’s photo albums, i mean you do not do that if you are just in it for two weeks.
you think?
yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you are sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
hey, you are right.
yeah.
thanks. (he starts to go inside and stops.) what photo album was it?
i do not know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
oh my god! those were not albino kids, that was computer camp! rach! (he hurries inside and chandler is taking out the garbage.)
hey.
hey.
you are a pathetic loser, right?
oh-ho, yeah!
sit!
oh my gosh, joshua!
they are not true?
oh.
oh! oh, i love that but.
you want to go inside and have some coffee?
okay. (joshua goes inside and to chandler.) every time.
oooh, what you got there?
pastrami.
oh-ho-ho, yeah! hey! y’know what goes good with that?
hm-mm, corn beef.
ooh, i was going to say bologna, but that is much better. how about a little of that smoked turkey?
okay.
(he starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) oh mama! uh when-when is the baby due?
six months.
ugh. now if a cow should die of natural causes, i can have one of those right?
not if i get there first.
god that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
yeah? well, you should know. you have bought like a billion of ‘them.
yeah, you did not get one.
okay, well tonight’s the big night.
yeah!
okay listen, how are you going to ask her?
it is going to be perfect. i am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I am going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I am just going to propose.
ohh…
that sounds perfect!
yeah.
you are going to mess it up let me do it.
I am not going to mess it up.
if she says no, can i have the ring?
she is not going to say no.
if!
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey!
(with her mouthful) hi monica.
(to phoebe) give me it!
it is gone.
phoebe!
hey!
(with his mouthful) hi monica.
(to chandler) we are practically kissing. (makes a kissy face and winks at him.)
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey rach!
are any of you guys free tonight? my boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people i bring, the better i look. so, monica? chandler?
(glaring at her) well, monica and chandler can not go. we are going to dinner remember?!
oh my god, I am so sorry.
what is the big deal?
i just get mad when rachel does not remember where we are going.
where are you going?
how about you guys? (points to phoebe and joey.)
open bar?
i think so.
i can do that for the kids.
hey, y’know what? I will come too. I am making money now; it is about time i give something back.
well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
okay. have a benefit.
(entering) hey!
hey! ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
oh no, i have plans with elizabeth.
oh, so you are already doing your part for the kids.
I am sorry, it is just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!
ross let me ask you a question. all jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
wait a minute, all jokes aside? i did not agree to that!
do you really see this as a long-term thing?
i do not know.
y’know, you are 12 years older than her.
wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
uh-uh—wow! uh, i thought you guys were just like making jokes, i had no idea. what you know what? you guys are wrong. uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but i never notice it. you know why? because she is very mature. besides, it does not really matter to me what you guys think. i mean, I am the one dating elizabeth, not you!
that is not what she said last night. (ross glares at him.)
see? now, he could date her.
will you marry me? will you marry me? (makes like a gun with his fingers.) hey, you marry me! (he gives up as joey, rachel, phoebe, and ross slink in all excited.) what is going on little elves?
it is the big night! we wanted to wish you good luck!
yeah, yeah you have the ring?
yeah, right here in my pocket. (pats his pocket. phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) pheebs?
oh! oop! (hands him back the ring.)
okay, now will you guys get out of here? i want this is to be a surprise and she is going to know.
(to the rest of them) yeah-yeah you guys. get out of here!
hi guys.
(to monica) you are beautiful.
oh, thank you! (the gang exhibits signs of quiet apprehension and wears knowing glances.) (monica giggles.) what is going on?
(breaking up) we are just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
here.
oh! thank you!
so now what is going on here?
uh well, uh this is a silent auction. they lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
no, i know what a silent is i meant, what is going on with your hair?
(suddenly worried) uh, wh-why?
no! it is nice!
oh, hi!

well, y’know i-i do not know where he is.
well, y’know what? actually, i was about to bid on this lovely trip to paris.
yeah.

ugh! so close!
hey you guys! look!
hey!

i won! that was my guess!
what?! what?! what?!
i guessed 20,000!
joey! it is an auction! you do not guess, you buy!
what?! i do not have 20,000!
joey! sit down! (pulls him down.)
forget her! you enjoy this!! (pulls him back up and starts applauding again. joey waves and does a salute.]
what are you doing?
(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) one nation, under god. indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (laughs.) i remembered it. (it is a butchered version of the pledge of allegiance of the united states for our foreign friends.) the champagne is here. (the waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
are you okay?
yes! yes! I am good! are you good? are you good? is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
yeah. I am okay. I am actually—I am a little cold, can i have your jacket?
oh, yeah. (starts to take it off and then realizes) uh, no you can not have my jacket! because then i would be cold! if you thought that you were going to be cold, you should have brought your own jacket. but uh, other than that, are you okay? are you okay?
(laughs) are you sure you are okay?
yes! I am fine. in fact I have been fine for a long time now and i think, the reason is you.
ohh that is sweet!
okay umm, before i meant you i had really little life and i could not imagine growing old with…
(interrupting him) oh my god!
(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) i know, but just let me say it.
oh my god, richard. (yep, richard’s back.)
what?! I am chandler! (she nods towards the doorway, chandler turns and looks) oh, that is richard!
oh god, maybe he will not see us. richard!
hey-hey, hey! (gets up and hugs him.) i do not know why i did that!
hey, it is good to see you!
yeah—oh that is right. you, you always wanted me too. hey, i see you got your mustache back.
(to richard’s date) and uh, you do not have a mustache which is good. (she just smiles.) I am chandler; i make jokes when I am uncomfortable.
hi.
richard! no one supposed to know about us! (richard just smiles at him.) see i, did it again.
chandler, wh-why do not we sit down?
yeah, I will sit down. (he slides back into his chair.)
(to richard) it is good to see you
yes. (thinking he is gone.)
what were you thinking?!
i did not know it was an auction!
wh?!
i figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
why would a charity give away a free boat?!
i do not know! charity?
ugh!
well, just buy the damn boat! (she is still working her way through her tray of booze.)
phoebe, do not you think you have had enough to drink?
I am just helping the kids!
how is you drinking helping the kids?
because the more i drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
oh hi!
just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
(to rachel) hey, i was pretty close. (she just glares at him.) uhh, so bad news. umm, i can not buy the boat, i do not have any money.
joey! joey, good one! (mr. thompson starts to laugh.)
so uh listen, i think I am going to take off now. (starts to get up.)
(stopping him) hey! you…can not…leave joey! you agreed to buy that boat, all right?! that is a contract! and plus if you leave, my boss is going to kill me!
well, what am i going to do rach?! i do not have that kind of money!
i know. okay. (whispering and thinking.) okay. okay. all right. all right, this is what we are going to do, we are going to go to the next highest bidder, and we are just going to let them buy it, and then you are just going to pay the difference.
okay.
okay.
look, i do not know why the kids need a youth center anyway! y’know? they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine!
not great.
and so, we are hiding in the bathroom.
so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know they are going at it right on the bathroom floor.
i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
ohh.
what?!
oh my god, you guys!! (he is excited about what he thought happened.)
(stopping him from going any further) before you say anything, have we got a story for you! guess who we bumped into at dinner!
who?
richard!
what? (excited) a-ohh! (realizes) ohh. oh that is right that is right. that is richard’s favorite place too.
oh you knew that. good!
i thought you were going out with elizabeth.
yeah, i was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
oh ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can not get out of!
y’know, maybe she is too young for me. y’know, when i was over there and she was running around with her friends, i felt like i was a baby-sitter. i finally started to see what you guys were talking about. i do not know what to do.
why do not you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. i mean that is what i did when i first (looks at chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.
okay umm, bad stuff. well, I am-I am 12 years older than she is.
if the school finds out you are fired.
hmm.
she is leaving for three months.
for camp!
okay, good stuff. umm, well she is-she is sweet and pretty and…
look ross, the only question you need to ask is, "do you see a future?" i mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (ross pauses in consideration.) oh my god! you did it already! you married her, did not you?!
no! no! i…did not do that. it is just… okay, honestly no. i do not, i do not see a big future with her.
okay well i think…that is your answer.
I have got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part.
hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if you are not careful you may not get married at all this year!
rach! rachel! okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
oh great!
(to phoebe) oh and uh the guy who got the paris trip is at table four.
oh, okay.
(to phoebe) why do you care about the guy who won the paris trip?
it is a trip for two! (she gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she is wearing over her dress.) excuse me. (she walks over to table four.) excuse me, is the person who won the paris trip at this table?
oh, en chante. (she holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)
uhh, excuse me is there a mr. bowmont at this table?
ahh, yes. (pushes rachel in front of himself so that she could do the talking.)
oh well, hello. this is your lucky day mr. bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and i believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
you-you have to pay that! it is not just a guess.
(to joey) okay. okay. (shushes him.)
ohh…
are you kidding me?! she is going to this boat!
y-yeah! what-what is your wife’s name?
pam! oh god okay, just imagine this, "the pam."
aw-awww!
okay, uh-uh imagine this, "the mr. bowmont."
oooooh…
okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (she sits down next to him.) all right, you are settin’ sail up the hudson! you have got the wind in your h—(sees that he is bald)—arms! you-you get all that peace and quiet that you have always wanted! you get back to nature! you can go fishin’! you can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you are old, cappy.
no way! it is mine!!
(to joey) what?! what?!
all that stuff you just said? i want that!
but joey you do not have $20,000!
who cares?! i-I will make payments, whatever it takes, i want the mr. bowmont!!
oh my god, you are back!
ohh, let me see it! let me see your hand! (chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)
why do you want to see my hand?
i want to see what is in your hand. i want to see the trash.
yeah.
eww! oh, it is all dirty. you should throw this out.
(suspiciously) okay. (exits to carry out phoebe’s wishes.)
(after the door closes) what did you guys just do?!
what happened?
richard was there so i could not do it!
what?! noooo… (phoebe gasps.)
I am going to do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you have ruined it!
we did not ruin it!
who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…
glove salesman!
good one! yeah.
this is terrible. what am i going to do?
look, she only suspects something okay? she does not know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
that is right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
yeah! yeah! convince her that-that you are scared of commitment! convince her that you are a little coward!
i can do that, I have had 30 years of practice.
hey, being you is finally going to pay off! (they give each other fives.)
(entering) i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
that guy’s still doing that?!
(entering) hey! (sees monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) oh my god you are here, let me see your hand!!
no, you are too late!!! she already took out the trash!!!
(in his head) wow! i have never had such a healthy break-up! she was such a grown-up about it! she did not seem too immature for me! did i just make a huge mistake?
elizabeth, thank god! i was just thinking about…
what?!
okay, break-up’s still on!
okay, okay, here she comes! (sits on the couch next to him.) how do i look? do i look like a guy who does not want to get married?
yeah! and also, a little like a french guy. (they both squint at each other.) i never noticed that before.
(entering) hi guys!
hey!
hey!
what are you up too?
oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites. (joey laughs.) yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
(laughs) yeah, big brother.
well that is a little crazy. although i am y’know glad to hear that you are branching out on what you look at on the internet.
yeah, well… y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world!
eh…
okay well that is good to know.
(all excited) the mr. bowmont’s here!!! (jumps over the back off the couch and runs out into the street.)
sure, i love this part! (starts to look busy.)
richard!
ohh… oh, that is okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef. like i have nothing better to do! so what is up?
oh, good to see you too. did you come down here to tell me that?
what uh—what did you—what?!
y’know you are really not supposed to be back here!
oh god… (starts looking around.) why do not they put chairs back here?!
what the… yes you are too late! where was all this three years ago?!
what were you doing in africa?
ohhh! what are you doing to me?! oh look, i-i… I am sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
well he is! yeah, i mean marriage is all he talks about! my goodness, in fact, I am the one that is making him wait!
yeah!
why? because of the government.
is not it incredible?! monica and chandler, gettin’ married.
i know, they are going to be so happy together.
ohh… i mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
not that often!
no! I am so happy for them!
me too! so happy for them!
I am so happy and not at all jealous.
oh no! no god, definitely not jealous!
i mean I am probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. and i mean what is 2%? that is nothing.
totally. I am like 90/10.
yeah me too.
hey uh, have you guys scene chandler?
(staring at him) wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, tennille.
so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you do not really believe that do you?
sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. let us take a second here and look at pigs. okay pigs do not mate for life. i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that is just an ordinary pig not even a pig that is good at sports!
yeah, but that is pigs not people!
if marriage worked, I would be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this?!
whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?! is this some new kind of strategy? why do not you put down your copy of ‘the rules’ huh mantrap?!
y’know what?! i got to go! ugh!
(to them) it is okay, i got a plan.
we are going to find love!
definitely!
yeah, I am pretty confident about that. that is what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for monica and chandler! it would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
what do you mean?
well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they are 40, they marry each other.
you mean a backup?
exactly!
yeah, yeah i got that.
you do?
hm-mmm.
who?
joey.
joey?!
yeah!
are you serious?!
yeah, i locked him years ago!
wh… so… if neither of you are married by the time you are 40, you are going to marry joey.
yep, we shook on it. yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
oh, seriously?
ohh, yeah. i think his exact words were… (she makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
charming.
well hey, it is just a backup.
yeah.
hey monica!
have you seen rachel? or a mirror?
this is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
yeah, it is great.
whoa-whoa, what is the matter?! talk to the captain!
I am just having one of those days where you realize you are in a dead-end relationship!
chandler giving you a hard time huh?
it is not like i want to get married tomorrow! it is just that i-I would like to believe that I am in a relationship that is actually going somewhere, that I am not just wasting my time!
well, you know chandler.
no i do not know chandler! not anymore! it is like it is like something is changed.
maybe you changed?
i did not change!
maybe that is the problem.
what?!
chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
is that some kind of boat talk?
i do not know! (all excited) i have not totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
what does he think? does he think I am just going to wait around for nothing?
monica face it, chandler is against marriage. and-and always will be!
(starts for the door) well there is some people who do want to marry me.
there are?
yeah! richard!
r-r-richard said he wants to marry you?! (monica nods yes.) and-and chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!
that is right.
chandler loves marriage!!
you just told me that he hates marriage! that-that he is a-a complex fellow who is unlikely to take a wife! that-that he is against marriage and always will be!
you got that from what i said?!
what happened you guys?
rach!
hey you!
hey, come on in.
oh thank you. hey y’know, I am so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth.
oh, thanks. yeah, i really thought we would be able to make it work, but uh, i guess it just was not meant to be.
yeah, love. it is a tricky business is not it?
i guess so.
so what do you say we make a pact? if you and i are both single by the time we are 40, we get married. i mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we have-we have already slept together so y’know there will be no surprises there! you know what i mean? no like, "what is that?!"
right. ohh! you-you want me to be your backup.
exactly.
ohh, yeah i already have one.
what? who?
phoebe.
phoebe?! wait a—but-but she just, she said that joey was her backup.
ohh, i do not think so.
ross! i just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and joey made a deal!
that is impossible! i mean we have had a deal for years! we-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
where the hell have you been?!
i was making a coconut phone with the professor.
richard told monica he wants to marry her!
what?!
yeah! yeah, I have been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes would not keep flying off!
my—oh my god!
i know! they suck!!
he is not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I am supposed to do that!
i know!
well what… y’know what I am going to do? I am going to go over there; I am going to kick his ass! (pause) will you help me?!
look, chandler i do not think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. okay? just go and find monica!
you are right.
yeah!
okay. (starts running for the bedroom) I am going to get the ring! I am going to get the ring! (does so) I am going to go find her and (starts running for the door) I am just going to propose!
okay.
okay great.
dude-dude-dude!
what?!
let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
hi.
i do not know why I am here.
i do not know.
(entering) chandler is such an idiot!
yeah, I will have a scotch…
(moving over to the couch) still smoking cigars?
no that is, that is okay.
uh yeah, i-i actually i thought about you a couple months ago.
yeah but it was because i-i had an eye exam and i do not like my new eye doctor.
edward nevski?
no.
but getting over was the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. and i never let myself think about you.
phoebe! you picked joey and ross?! you can not have two backups!
of course i can! it is just good sense to backup your backup! look, I have already lost chandler!
what?!
(entering) hey!
(entering) hey!
phoebe! we are both (points at ross and himself) your backup?!
phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
i do not—look i do not know what you are complaining about now? you were both aware of the situation!
no we were not!
i was not!
okay, this kind of back talk is not going to fly when we are married!
phoebe you can not have both of them! you have to pick one!
pick me!!
no! pick me! i do not want to end up an old maid!
all right well let us see, ross is a good father, but joey has a boat—this is hard!
this is crazy! hey look, i want to switch to rachel!
ooh, i want to switch to rachel too!
no wait! just—okay—just wait! you guys! wait you guys! do not make any rash decisions, okay? just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
oh god, phoebe!
(to rachel) I am talking about massages.
oh.
okay, y’know what?! i know-i know how to settle this! all right here, this is what we are going to do! I am going to write joey on one napkin (does so) and I am going to right ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! and that person is going to be our backup! okay?
okay that is fair.
all right.
good!
pick one.
left! (rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) thank you.
you are welcome.
(reading) ross!
(reading) joey! (pause) we should just switch.
yeah absolutely! (they both switch.)
yeah.
(to the mask) i missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
oh! (laughs and points at the mask.) him.
i missed this apartment! now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! y’know, i-i should be with a grown-up, do you know what i mean?!
y’know, let us face it, I am not a kid anymore! i-i need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that i do! i mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, i want that! talking about pig sex over lunch, i do not want that!
fair? please do not even talk to me about fair! fair would have been you wanting to marry me back then! or fair would have been chandler wanting to marry me now! believe me, nothing about this is fair! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing! nothing!
nothing. (she backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) i do not kn—umm. i do not know. umm…
y’know, i-i… i have to figure…some st—y’know, some stuff before i can…
where is she? I am not scared of you! (averts his eyes and walks in.)
(examining the coffee table) scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? ha-ha, monica! monica!
well where did she go?
oh my god, i can not believe this! y’know, i thought…i thought you were a good guy.
nothing happened? nothing? so you did not tell my girlfriend that you love her?
y’know what? i can not believe this! do you know what you did? my girlfriend is out there thinking things over! you made my girlfriend think!!
and what does she have to think about? i love her!
but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, y’know? a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things, she would be surprised!
it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this is not fair. you had your chance with her! you had your chance and you blew it! and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! and this is all just been one stupid mistake! (sits down heavily.) i was going to propose tonight.
yeah i even (pause) got a ring. (puts in on the center cushion.) did you get a ring?
y’know richard…you are a good guy.
dude!
i can not talk to you now, i got to find monica!
she is gone.
what?
she is gone. she had a bag and she left.
what are you talking about?
she was all crying. she-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
well why did not you stop her?! why did not you just tell her it was a plan?!
i-i did! i told her everything, chandler! but she would not believe me.
well where… where did she go?
to her parent’s i think and she said you should not call her. but if i were you i would.
i can not believe i ruined this.
i am so sorry man.
you wanted it to be a surprise.
oh my god.
chandler… in all my life… i never thought i would be so lucky. (starting to cry.) as to…fall in love with my best…my best… there is a reason why girls do not do this!
okay! (he joins her on one knee) okay! okay! oh god, i thought… (starting to cry, pauses) wait a minute, i-i can do this. (pause) i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it. then i realized the only thing that matters is that you, (pause) you make me happier than i ever thought i could be. (starting to cry again.) and if you will let me, i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (pause as he gets out the ring.) monica, will you marry me?
yes.
i knew you were likely to take a wife!
(yelling through the door) can we come it yet?! we are dying out here!
come in! come in! (joey, rachel, and phoebe burst through the door.) we are engaged!!!
ohhh, this is the least jealous I have ever been!
oh no wait no, this is wrong! ross is not here!
oh…
oh hell, he is done this three times! he knows what its about!
yeah!
terry, i, i, i know that i have not worked here very long, but i was wondering, do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance in my salary?
it is so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family. see, every year we go skiing in vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but i sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why i took this job.
ok, i, i hear what you are sayin'. I am with you. um, but i, but I am trying really hard. and i think I am doing better. i really do. does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) oh, look at that.
excuse me, sir. hi, you come in here all time. i was just wondering, do you think there is a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
ok, ok, that is fine. fine. hey, I am sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) only $98.50 to go.
hey. ross, did you know mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving?
no, they are not.
yes, they are. the blymens invited them.
you are wrong.
i am not wrong.
you are wrong.
no, i just talked to them.
(getting up, upset) I am calling mom.
hey, hey.
hey.
hey.
and this from the cry-for-help department. are you wearing makeup?
yes, i am. as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor slash model.
that is so funny, because i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man slash woman.
what were you modeling for?
you know those posters for the city free clinic?
oh, wow, so you are going to be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
you know, the asthma guy was really cute.
do you know which one you are going to be?
no, but i hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)
good luck, man. i hope you get it.
thanks.
(to monica) well, you were right. how can they do this to us, huh? it is thanksgiving.
ok, I will tell you what. how about i cook dinner at my place? I will make it just like mom's.
will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
you know, they are not actually supposed to have... (ross looks at her sheepishly) I will work on the lumps. joey, you are going home, right?
yeah.
and i assume, chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
yes, every single one of them.
phoebe, you are going to be with your grandma?
yes, and her boyfriend. but we are celebrating thanksgiving in december because he is lunar.
so you are free thursday, then.
yeah. oh, can i come?
yeah. rach, are you thinking you are going to make it to vail?
absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go.
i thought it was $98.50.
yeah, well it was. i, i broke a cup.
well, I am off to carol's.
ooh, ooh! why do not we invite her?
(mimicking) ooh, ooh. because she is my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
hi, is uh, is carol here?
oh, i uh, just came by to pick up my skull. well, not mine, but...susan: come in.
thanks. yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum.
kind of like a big face without skin.
ok. (browsing the apartment) wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
(picking up a book) hey, hey, yertle the turtle. a classic.
the uh, the baby that has not been born yet? would not that mean you are... crazy?
you are not serious, i mean, you really... you really talk to it?
do you uh, do you talk about me?
really?
look, if she is talking to it, i just think that i should get some belly time too. not that i believe any of this.
oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we will all talk, and you will hear everything we say.
I would just like to say that I am totally behind this experiment. in fact, I would very much like to butter your head.
hey, rach, did you make your money?
no, not even close. forget vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
rach, here is your mail.
thanks, you can just put it on the table.
(insistently) no, here is your mail.
thanks, you can just put it on the table.
(gives her an envelope) would you just open it?
oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
we all chipped in.
(to monica) we did?
(to joey) you owe me 20 bucks.
thank you. thank you so much!
(hands chandler a bag) chandler, here you go, got your traditional thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of funyuns.
wait, wait, chandler, this is what you are having for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
all right, I am nine years old.
oh, i hate this story.
we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they are getting divorced.
oh my god.
yes. it is very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you have seen it in reverse.
uh, hi. we uh, we used to work together.
yeah, at macy's. you were the obsession girl, right? i was the aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) aramis? aramis?
i got to tell you. you are the best in the business.
I am serious. you are amazing. you know when to spritz, when to lay back.
ooh, you smell great tonight. what are you wearing?
listen, uh, you want to go get a drink or something?
what is wrong?
oh. what?
wait, wait, wait!
so i guess you all saw it.
saw what?
no, we were just laughing. you know, how laughter can be infectious.
set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd.
tonight, on a very special blossom.
mmm, looking good. ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices ross is depressed) what?
i do not know. it is just not the same without mom in the kitchen.
all right, that is it. you know what? just get out of my way and stop moping.
that is closer.
i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
oh, you must stop shooping.
ok, I am going to get my stuff.
chandler, will you just come in already?
no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that is not funny anymore.
hey, monica, i got a question. i do not see any tater tots.
that is not a question.
but my mom always makes them. it is like a tradition. you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! it is bad enough i can not be with my family because of my disease.
all right, fine. tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
ok, I am off to talk to my unborn child.
ah!
ok, mom never hit.
(stirring pot) ok, all done.
what, phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? ross needs lumps!
oh, I am sorry, oh, i just, i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
why would we do that?
well, because then they would be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) oh, sorry! oh, sorry!
the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away.
the balloon?
no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it is all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park. I am going to the roof, who is with me?
i can not, i got to go.
come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen?
almost never.
got the keys? or got the keys!
ok.
ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) ok, where am i talking to, here? i mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. you know, i, you know, can not do this. uh, this is too weird. i feel stupid.
(quickly talking) hello, baby. hello, hello.
i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean.
ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. why are we standing here?
we are waiting for you to open the door. you got the keys.
no i do not.
yes, you do. when we left, you said, "got the keys."
no i did not. i asked, "got the ke-eys?"
no, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
do either of you have the keys?
(panicked) the oven is on.
oh, i got to get my ticket!
wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
well then get it, get it!
that tone will not make me go any faster.
(angry) joey!
that one will.
and everyone is telling me, you got to pick a major, you got to pick a major. so, on a dare, i picked paleontology. and you have no idea what I am saying, because, let us face it, you are a fetus. you are just happy you do not have gills anymore.
oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, ok?
shh! (singing) here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. hey, hey! (to carol) hey, uh, did you just feel that?
does it always, uh--?
(singing) hey, hey, you are my baby, and i can not wait to meet you. when you come out I will buy you a bagel, and then we will go to the zoo.
(singin) hey, hey, I am your daddy. I am the one without any breasts.
nope, not that one.
can you go any faster with that?
hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. you do the math.
why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
(sarcastic) for an emergency just like this.
(grabs chandler by the shirt) all right, listen, smirky. if it was not for you and your stupid balloon, i would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. but I am not.
i swear you said you had the keys.
no, i did not. i would not say i had the keys unless i had the keys, and i obviously did not have the keys.
ooh, ok, that is it. enough with the keys. no one say keys.
why would i have the keys?
aside from the fact that you said you had them?
but i did not.
well, you should have.
why?
because!
why?
because!
why? because everything is my responsibility? is not it enough that I am making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I am making different kinds of potatoes. does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want? nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions, and mario gets his tots, and it is my first thanksgiving, and it is all burned, and, and i... i...
ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go.
well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
here we come, walkin' down the—this does not smell like mom's.
no, it does not, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
oh, god, this is great! the plane is gone, so it looks like I am stuck here with you guys.
hey, we all had better plans. this was nobody's first choice.
oh, really? so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner?
you call that delicious?
stop it, stop it, stop it!
now this feels like thanksgiving.
ooh.
what?
ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. oh my god. he is not alone. ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal.
I have got to see this. all right ugly naked guy!
ooh, ugly naked dancing!
it is nice that he has someone.
shall i carve?
by all means.
ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
i do not even want to know about the dark cheese.
(holding sandwich) does anybody want to split this with me?
oh, i will.
ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
make a wish?
come on, you know, thanksgiving. ooh, you got the bigger half. what did you wish for?
the bigger half.
I would like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this is not the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you would gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you did not have syphilis and stuff, we would not be all together, you know? so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.
and hey, here is to a lousy christmas.
and a crappy new year.
here, here!
(enters the room) hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
(browsing through a diary) well, let me see... i-i believe I am... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv.
look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
i could fall asleep at a play.
what is it?
it is a one-woman play called "why do not you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".
it sounds interesting!
yeah, it does sound interesting, i mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, i do not think it gets bett... (ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)
i know, i know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
you guys are going to have a great time, i promise!
what? how come that you do not have to go!
i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day, so i can not go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
(browsing through a diary) uh, let us see, who do i hate?
(gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but joey blocks her way) oh, sorry... oops, sorry.
(lifts rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) hey, here you go.
ooh... oooh... (pause) (rachel is all bah-jiggity about joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to monica) can i ask you a question?
yeah.
do you think it is possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
no, i do not think it ever works. why?
no reason.
no, no, rachel?
yeah
who do you want to fool around with?
(with high pitched voice) nobody, forget it!
(giggling and whispering) maybe.
(whispering) you can not!
(whispering) why? (monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with "because") seriously i did not understand a word that you said.
in the hall.
you want to fool around with joey?
yeah! you know, ever since i had that dream about him, and can not get it out of my head! and what is the big deal, people do it all the time!
who? who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
ok, off the top of my head... don and janet.
who, who are they?
i know them from work.
both of them?
no, one of them...
which one?
i do not know, what were the names i just said?
rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
all right, all right, you are right, i will not do anything with joey, i just thought that we (joey enters the hall) ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (joey enters his apartment)
what the hell are you cooking!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey, you guys will not believe what i have to do for work today.
yes, but, ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
(covering with his hand chandler's face, like pretending he is not there) (to monica) there are these two professors who are joining my department and i have to meet them here and show them around campus.
what is so bad about that?
it is i just know they are going to be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
(fingering her elbow): ross?
(looking his elbow, where there is a patch) these are not suede.
hi, hi, I am ross geller.
oh, oh, that is, that is, that is nice.
oh, no, it is no big deal, i mean, if i were not doing this I would just, you know, be at the gym working out.
(to chandler) is he going to introduce us?
(to monica) no, i think we are just blurry shapes to him now.
oh, ha, i wrote that in one minute.
(to chandler) twenty bucks says they are married within the month.
(hitting monica with his suitcase) (to charlie) we should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.
i do not think so.
oh, well he is obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can not come on time, then do not come at all". (pause) an option that many of my students use. (pause) shall we?
you know what, he is a big boy, I am sure he will find us, ok?
oh, damn it!
(entering the room) hey!
hey!
what is happenin'?
yeah, it is a real shame you can not make it to that one-woman show tonight.
oh, I would love to, but i got to get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)
(yelling) stupid jane rogers!!
(angry) you are having a party tonight??
kind of have a... a thing for the days of our life's people.
and you were not going to tell us? how did you think you were going to get away with that?
i do it every year.
you do that every year??
i did not have to tell you that!! I am stupider than jane rogers!!
oh, that is why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
yeah...
and last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
yeah...
oh! and the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
(smiling) i can not believe you guys went for that one!
joey, why would not you invite us to your parties?
you are fine, ok? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
well, then so you just invite me...!
(speaking aloud) please, i was trying to be nice, you are the worst one!
oh, joey, come on! please, please! let me come, i will behave, i promise! i will behave! please, please, please...
ok, ok! fine! you can come, but do not tell anybody else. it is up on the roof at 8.
(yelling and jumping like a child) oh, a soap opera roof party!! I am going to a soap opera roof party!! oh my god, oh my god!! (realizing how she is behaving) and it is out of my system!
(very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to charlie) so, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
(to charlie) oh, it is not over!
so basically all nuts?
I have lost the will to live.
what?
oh... ok, fine. but... ehm... i just have one question for you, ehm... (aping professor spafford) when we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
(entering with charlie) oh, hey you guys! this is charlie! charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica.
hi!
yeah, charlie is going to be joining my department.
oh, you are a paleonthologist, too! (pause) oh, ok, now, what do you think of ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
ah, ah.
(to phoebe) ranion's theory of species variegation?
yeah, i saw the article on your coffee table and i memorized the title to freak you out!
(to ross) so, did you two have fun?
oh my god, she is great! i mean, we-we have so much in common and she is just cool, and funny...
and i do not know if you have noticed but she is a (aloud) hotty!! (charlie looks at her) hi!
(she enters wearing a bath-robe) hey... hi you guys! listen, you know what? I am not feeling really well. i think i can not get out for the play.
really? wh-what is wrong?
i do not know! i think it is kind of serious! oh, you know... i was watching this thing on tv this morning about... newcastle disease... and i think i might have it!!
... ok, who is this?
I am sorry, rachel, this is charlie wealer, she is a collegue.
oh, hi! i would check your hand but... I am sure you do not want to get my chicken disease!
hey, rachel, can-can i see you for a sec?
sure! (monica takes her apart) oh...
you are not sick!
what? yes, i am!
ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??
when you are sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)
you just want to stay home so you can make a move on joey!
oh, no, no! i heard you before, that is so not what this is!
ok, what is this?
ok! (whispering) joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
(aloud) what?
(looking at them) wh-what is going on?
joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof!
and he did not want you guys to know about it but i came over here to tell you!!
ok professor or detective?
joey's having a party and he was not going to invite us?
yeah, and he does it every year! that is why he is sending you to that play! that is why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
and that horrible museum tour!
no, i arranged that...
(sounds tired) hey you guys, I am turning in. have fun.
we know about your party joey.
what party?
the game's over! take off your robe!
(looks perplexed and opens up his robe) ok... i mean...
(to charlie after covering himself up again) nice to meet ya! (charlie waves hesitantly and joey leaves)
(to some people) hey! hey alright! hey, glad you could make it (shakes a man's hand) thanks for coming.
oh my god! kyle lowder!
(yells after him) i love you!
hey, that is why i did not invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...
oh yeah that is what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
hey!
(excited) oh my god, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? i can barely control myself.
monica, you might want to remember that you are married. where is chandler anyway? (looks around)
(shocked) oh my god! chandler!
where the hell is everybody?
(to rachel) hey! joey said no autographs! but if she is gettting one, then i want one too: to monica. and none of this "best wishes" crap. i want "love".
ok actually mon, matthew was just giving me his phone number.
oh man! if i had known i was coming to this party i never would have gotten married!
nice to meet you.
ok
(yelling after him) we will!!
(to rachel) look at you with all the guys!
yeah!
i guess you have forgotten all about joey?
yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten about joey and clearly you have forgotten about chandler!
please... chandler is the love of my life... (at which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! have mercy! (follows the man in the leather)
(to charlie) so, eh... it is probably going to be hard for you to leave boston, huh?
ooh... so sad... still, it can not be easy for you to leave harvard? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer?
you... you dated albert wintermeyer?
... and you called him alby!? (laughs) i mean that is like... like calling albert einstein... er... alby...
eh, you think? i mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
(very interested) oh! like what?! (charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) oh I am sorry, i do not mean to pry... it is just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "access hollywood".
who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?
(a little suprised) two? wha...? do not tell me you dated benjamin hobart
oh my god! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who has not won the nobel prize?
oh yeah? no, no nobel prizes for him?
huh... huh... what a loser! some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)
hey ross!
(sarcastically) oh great! after i finish my wine I am going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
oh, what is the matter?
she... she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners. oh my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
i always loved that!!
of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (rachel nods) man, i can not compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my god!
worse?
oh much, much worse. i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) "can we walk"? (phoebe starts laughing) oh, you... you like that?
(still laughing) no. (points to rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)
what? (turns around to look at rachel)
come on! i think this is funny! (ross leaves)
(to himself) oh yes, god yes!!
i... i do not know... you seem lovely.
hey ross, this is one of my co-stars, dirk. (to dirk) dirk, this is my good friend ross. (ross and dirk shake hands)
nice to meet you.
oh, I am no actor, I am a professor of palaeontology.
it is a science.
hey ross, listen, dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
oh, well no, but i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
I would lead with that.
that is it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).
monica!
do not worry joe, i will not come next year!
(to rachel) what have you got there?
just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) damn, that is a lot of guys! are you a little slutty?
(drunken voice) i think i am.
(browsing the tissues) let me see if i approve any of these clowns. this guy wears a rug (discards one). this guy's canadian (discards another). and this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and i do not feel any different.
(discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...
(picking up the tissues) why, why, what is wrong with these guys?
nothing major, it is just that, you know, they are not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
joey, you are so sweet.
that is true. but you know what, it does not matter because i already know who you are going to go home with tonight.
who (looks around)?
me.
(surprised) what? (with a nervous smile) really?
yes, because we live together, that is a joke!
oh! screw it, i did not get it! (they high-five)
gotcha.
oh, very funny... joey.
(to monica) so, how did you enjoy the play?
oh my god, honey, I am so so so so so sorry.
well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
you really liked it?
oh yeah! i mean at first i hated it, but why would not i, because as a man I have been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) but after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", i was uplifted.
oh really!
oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!
no!
did somebody sign your bra?
so i got it when i was 13...
hey ross! so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just going to let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off? what is that, come on, a piece of paper?
it is actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
go charlie! but my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. maybe she is looking to, you know, slum it with some average joe phd.
yeah, maybe. i do have my whole career in front of me. i mean, i can still win a nobel prize. although the last two papers I have written were widely discredited.
you are so much more than just brains! you are sweet, and kind, and funny...
and sexy.
ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
yeah, you are right, thanks pheebs, I am going to go find her.
good for you! and hey, i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch!
stop going through my stuff (walks away)!
(to monica) hey!
hey!
i just wanted to let you know I have changed my mind: I am going to do it, I am going to kiss joey.
no, you can not! friends hooking up is a bad idea.
please, what about you and chandler?
that is different! i was drunk and stupid!
well hello (points to herself)!
what about all the guys that you have got the phone numbers from? why do not you just kiss one of them?
i could, i could but i do not want to! i want to kiss joey!
alright (shrugs). i think it is a big mistake but it is your decision.
(pause) I am going to do it.
and i can not stop you.
no.
(to rachel) hey rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?
I am smarter than him!
hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler.
oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you.
oh, you are so wonderful.
can not believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).hi!
hey! so what is the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
okay, our news. my company has asked me to head up our office in tulsa , so as of monday I am being officially relocated.
oh my god!
what?!
what?!
monday?!
how long do you have to go for?
they said it could be up to a year.
a year?!
(to monica) do you have to go?
i kind of have to do not i? because of this stupid thing (points to her wedding ring.)
there is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
wait a minute, you can not go to tulsa. maybe you forgot, but we have got tickets to the jets game next week.
I am sorry buddy, but i do not think I am going to be able to make it.
we were going to go see the jets!
you can not go, i mean you are the glue that holds this group together!
really?
not you.
i can not believe you guys are moving.
i call their apartment!!!
here you are (hands rachel a cup of coffee)
thank you joey. you know what? I am not even sure i can have caffeine.
i went thru this with ben and carol. one cup of coffee will not affect your milk.
yeah. just to be sure I am going to call dr. wiener.
(laughs)
every time? (she takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)
uhuh.
rach, you do not have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? trust me, i know this.
all right, i trust you. (continues to dial)
rachel, i can see you dialing! i do not understand why...
I am on the phone! (on the phone) dr. wiener? (ross and rachel walk away)
(laughs)
it is so weird seeing ross and rachel with a baby. it is just so grown up.
i know, yeah. i feel like we are all growing up. person named wiener, god that kills me. (laughs)
look at you all grown up.
actually, you know what? i am. that whole thing with rachel made me realize that maybe I am ready for a more serious relationship. you know? like I would like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. and looks are not as important as...nah, she is got to be hot.
you know, i might know somebody. hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
i can do that, yeah. how is friday?
done. oh good, really?
yeah!
let us see! (opens her address book.) oh, you know who is great? sandy poophack.
(laughs) poophack... (laughs)
yeah... all right, well that rules out lana titweiller
(laughs)
(enters) hey!
hey!
I have got good news!
you got out of the whole tulsa thing?
okay, i have news. you do not have to move to tulsa. you can stay here and keep your job.
it is great! how?
so you are going to be gone four days a week? (thinks about it.) no.
I am sorry, are you just used to saying that?
no. i can not be away from you for that long.
really?
yeah, you are my husband. I am not going to live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
that is fast math! we could use you in tulsa.
honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you are going to tulsa, i want to go with you.
hey, you said that without gagging!
i know! (they high-five.)
(on the phone) excuse me? oh yeah? well, up yours too! (hangs up)
(enters from his bedroom)who the hell was that?!
dr. wiener.
rach, you can not call people at three in the morning.
oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
was there anything you did wrong with emma?
yes, of course there is! okay? I am not insane!
well, what was it?
hiccups.
rach, i told you, you can not call him every time any little thing comes up.
yeah well, not anymore i can not. he fired us! what are we going to do? we have to find a pediatrician. wait wait, monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. what was his name?
dr. gettleman? yeah i know, i do not think that is a good idea. in fact, i think he is dead.
argh! why does everything happen to me?!
rach, i promise first thing tomorrow we will find another doctor, but i got to get up early and I am not feeling all that well.
what? what, do you mean you are not feeling well? what do you have? is it rubella? because do not go near emma, she has not had that shot.
you know? come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like! (walks back into his room.)
(grabs the phone and stars dialing) (on phone) (in a high pitch voice) wiener, wiener (in a low pitch voice) wiener, wiener!!!
(comes back into the living room) rachel!!!
great! now he is going to know it was me!
(enters) hey!
hey!
so how is this for our big double date tonight? (she is all dressed up)
(realizes that he has forgotten all about the double date) oh my god!
ooh, great! just the reaction i was hoping for.
yeah, so you found someone for me. you did not forget?
of course not! and you are going to love mary ellen. she is really smart and cute and funny, and i can not tell you how i know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. so tell me some about my guy.
no.
come on, give me something. what is his name?
mike.
mike? okay! what is his last name?
damnit! is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
all right, we will se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
why did i have to say mike? i do not know a mike! why could not i have said... (looks through his address book) there is no guy in there!
it is impossible to find a good doctor. i mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are going to push their penis against your knee?
excuse me?
i know what she is talking about.
we have got to find a new pediatrician. ross was getting sick last night, and i think emma may have caught it.
why do not you go see dr. gettleman?
ross said he died.
he did not die. i saw his daughter last week. said he was fine. her on the other hand, botched botox.
oh, great! well, then I am going to take emma to see him. i wonder why ross said that he died.
oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
he saw a therapist?
yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
why? what was it?
that i was going to eat him.
mike!!!
(checks him out) okay! (walks over to his table and sits down with him)
everything is going to be fine. just follow my lead, okay? all you have to do is pretend to be mike.
atta boy!
okay, look...
joey, this is mary ellen jenkins. so, mike, how do you and joey know each other anyway?
(laughs) from school.
wow, you guys go way back then. so what are you up to these days?
mike, 'attorney at law'!
what? that is the kind of thing you usually run by me.
wow, that is great! i liked that better than the law thing, so...
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike.
no, no, that is not what i meant. let us get you a cocktail.
hey!
hey!
what are you doing?
looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa.
that is so sweet. find anything?
slim pickings.
nothing, huh?
no, 'slim pickings', it is a barbecue restaurant. they are looking for a cook. actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. they are looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
'slim pickings'...that is so cheesy.
'so cheesy' also has an opening.
honey, that is okay. i actually know this woman, nancy, who is a restaurant biz head-hunter. maybe she will know of something.
can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me. when we get to tulsa I am taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings'. 'so cheesy'? 'whole hog'? it is going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa.
(on phone) hi, nancy. hi, it is monica geller. I am good. listen, I am looking for a job in tulsa. well yeah, my husband has been relocated...because i love him! no, i do not want a job in new york. javo (sp?) is looking? oh my god! he asked for me personally? oh my god! oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I am moving to tulsa. yeah, so if you would tell javo (sp?) 'I will take it!'
hi, my name is rachel green, i have an appointment for emma.
thanks doctor.
you even have to ask?! (he grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (sees rachel) (to rachel) he is alive!
you know, it is so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and I have never heard about you.
yeah, that is because we had a bit of a falling out. mike hit my mom with a car.
that is okay mike, i have forgiven you. and now we are friends again everything's great!
please, we are trying to have a conversation. (pushes the wine glass closer to mary ellen.)
what?!
what?!
do you not know each other?
(laughs) of course we do! mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. yeah, where we pretend we do not know each other. we played all kinds of games. (to mike) hey, remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool?!
mike, let me ask you something. how many sisters does joey have?
what are you doing? i said seven! (holds up six fingers.) (realizes his mistake) argh!!!
joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
because i forgot about our date, I am so sorry.
(to joey) you are unbelievable! i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
who are you kidding? (to joey) you just find some guy off the street for me? oh god! this is humiliating!
look phoebe I am so sorry! hey, look, if you do not like this guy i can find you a better one. (looks around) mike!! mike!!
I am out of here (she leaves)
(to mary ellen) you are leaving too?
good night!
honey, we are leaving tomorrow you have still got a lot of packing to do.
you are right. (pause) maybe i should not go.
what?
so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, javo (sp?). it is just a little outside of tulsa.
how far outside?
manhattan.
and you are thinking of taking it? (pause) so before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but i guess now it is old job, (raises his hand) me, (raises his hand) new job.
I am going to miss this hand! okay i know it is a lot to ask, but oh my god chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
what happened to 'you can not live without me four days a week'?
well, if you really think about it, i mean four days is not that long. i mean, i see you monday before you go to work, and i see you thursday when you get back, and i always work late on tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it is really just one day. and well, if we can not make it one day, we have got real problems my friend.
i think you should take the job.
really?
yeah. i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
that is the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
hey!
how was the pediatrician?
oh, i really liked him. (looks at ross) yeah, it was really, really, really good.
you promised you would not say anything.
i know. (pause) ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (to ross) i do not care!
are you serious? you still see dr. gettleman?
he is a brilliant diagnostician!
diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
ross, seriously! you have got to go to an appropriate doctor.
why? why? i know it is a little weird, but hey, he is a great doctor, okay? he knows my medical history, and every time i go in there, he makes a big deal. 'ah look, it is my favorite patient!'
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
hey, i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
that was not a security blanket! that was a wall-hanging!
it did not spend much time on the wall!!!
sure.
why did you go along with that?
that is true. (pause) well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
prove it.
that would not stand in the way of a true pianist.
you are really good! i play a little guitar myself.
uhuh.
well, like acoustic folksy stuff. you know? but right now I am working on a couple 'iron maiden' covers.
it is okay. go ahead, ask me out.
(walks in)
(to mike) oh, you just caught me off guard! yeah, that would be nice.
look at this. my two best friends!
excuse me, i do not mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
with the circus? he is behind the elephant.
yeah, that is how i know. I am ross by the way.
i am a single parent.
well, let us say, i do not know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
hmm, yeah. (to a random boy in the waiting room) come on ross jr. it is time to go in.
hey, i helped you find waldo!
(enters) oh good, you have not left yet.
where have you been?
i got held up at dr. gettleman's office. there was some guy that freaked everybody out.
well, you got here just in time. i really have to go buddy. (they hug)
oh man.
promise to call me when you land.
of course i will call you. i love you.
i love you too. (they kiss)
okay, wow, wow, wow. watch the tongue people, we have got a baby over here.
bye chandler.
awww. (they hug) bye!
bye honey. (they hug)
(tries to hug joey but j. moves away) what is the matter joe?
I am mad at you for leaving! you are nothing but a big leaver. big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
dude, you see right thru me!! (they hug) (joey heads for the door and pushes chandler's suitcase on the way out.)
well, bye mon, bye ross, rachel, bye emma!
okay, bye-bye! (pushes chandler out the door.) good trip! (slams the door)
(runs out to the hallway) chandler, wait. it goes: old job, (raises her hand) new job, (raises her hand really high) you. this is just something i have to do.
i know.
i love you so much.
i know that too. (they kiss)
(on cell phone) do not worry, I will be back before you know it. yes it will be the same. because i know, that is how. i promise.
(on the phone with chandler) double promise? call me when you land.
can i talk now?
okay, bye. (he hangs up the phone.)
joey?
he had to board.(really excited) mmh... this cake is amazing!
my god, get a room!
i would get a room with this cake. i think i could show this cake a good time!
if you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
(with no hesitation) sex!
(looking at her) seriously, answer faster!
oh, I am sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" i was not thinking about "sex with you"!
(to phoebe) it is like a giant hug.
ross, how about you. what would you give up, sex or food?
food.
ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
oh my god. it is like sophie's choice.
oh god. what about you, joe? what would you give up, sex or food?
uhm... oh... i do not know, it is too hard.
no, you got to pick one!
oh... food. no, sex. food! sex! food! se-i do not know! good god, i do not know, i want girls on bread!
you got to see these latest pictures of emma.
oh, how cute!
yeah.
oh, she looks just like a little doll!
oh, no, no. that is a doll.
oh, thank god, because that thing's really creepy! (looking outside the window) look, there is chandler. (he is on the street, talking to a woman)
oh. who is the blonde, she is pretty.
oh! he is having an affair.
he is not having an affair!
you know, I am always right about these things.
no, you are not! last week you thought ross was trying to kill you!
well, I am sorry but it is hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) see, there is something going on with them. look, he is getting into the car with her!
oh, that does not mean anything.
oh yeah? well, let us see. (she takes her mobile phone) ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. phoebe calls chandler)
(picking up the phone) hello.
oh, hi chandler. it is phoebe. uhm... i know that monica is working today so...(back to central perk) ...i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel.
oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, I am stuck at the office all day.
(shocked) oh, well, it is a shame that you-that you miss the movie because we were going to see, you know, either "liar, liar" or "betrayal", or... "an affair to remember".
those are all really old!
ok, then maybe it will be, uhm...
(whispering) "dude, where is my car?"
(glancing at her) what?
they are in a caaar...
(to chandler at the phone) okay, we-we will talk to you later. okay, bye.
geez!
ok. quick. we got to find a cab and follow them.
oh, yeah, ok. let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
(patting her bag) i got them!
hi!
hey! you smell like perfume and cigarettes.
i was in the car with nancy all day.
nancy does not smoke!
well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
so? what do you think of the house?
it is perfect. it is everything we have been looking for.
is not it? then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) what were the things you said?
do not you love the huge yard?
and the fireplace in the bedroom.
and nancy said that it is really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
this is bringing out a lovely color in you!
so? do you think we should get it?
i do not know. what do you think?
i think we should.
i do too.
this is huge!
i know.
how bad you want to smoke, right now.
i do not know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day.
gotcha. when do we tell them about this?
we do not. not until it is a hundred percent. i mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
okay. right. oh my god that is going to be so hard.
i know. gooooood luck with it.
i just can not see chandler cheating!
I am telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
chandler? forty-five minutes? well, something is not right. i just can not believe he would do this to monica!
i know, and with the baby coming?
so, should we tell her?
i do not know. phoebe, if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
why? who would you seen him with?
no one, I am just saying if... (phoebe starts pinching him in his neck)
tell me what you know!
(yelling in pain) i know nothing! mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
all right. (she releases him). he is a good guy. you are right, he would not cheat.
believe me, if i did see with someone, there is no way i... (phoebe starts pinching him again)
oh, look at her, so happy!
if only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
hey, is uhm... is chandler here?
no, he is picking up dinner, why, what is up?
well, look, whatever happens, we are here for you and we love you.
we think chandler might be having an affair.
what?
phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester.
they went in together. so sorry.
oh my god! oh my god that is awful! what did you think of the house?
what?
(walking towards her to hold her and support her) monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
yeah, sure... uhm, I am devastated, obviously... (to the rest) did you think the neighborhood was homey? (chandler enters)
hey!
(to chandler) you son of a bitch!
is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
(goes to chandler) phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and... them... they think you are having an affair.
who is nancy?
what is going on?
(turns to them) ok, alright, you guys, you would better sit down, this is pretty big.
yeah (motions them to sit and they do) I am not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.
i knew he could not be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
why do you have a realtor?
uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
(clearly shocked) what?
are you serious?
when we found out that we are going to get this baby, chandler and i started talking and we decided that we did not want to raise a kid in the city.
so you are going to move?
oh my god.
should not we all vote on stuff like this?!
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I am doing it, ross is doing it, sarah jessica parker is doing it!
and that is great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
(sarcastic) so you want to buy a house in the 50's?
have you thought about what you would be giving up? you can not move out of the city, what if you want chinese food at 5am? or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door?
you know what, if you want to look for a house, that is okay.
no, no, it is not, do not listen to him! (to ross) I am going to thump you! (points his fist at him)
(to joey) it is ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay (back to mon and chan), but you are going to realize, this is the only place, you want to be.
actually, we already found a house we love.
what?
and about an hour ago, we made an offer.
bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh?
you put an offer on a house?
(smiling) it is so sweet. it really is. it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there is these old maple trees... (gets cut off)
wha..? again with the nature, what are you? beavers?
i know this is really hard and we are really sorry.
is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food? (walks towards the fridge) because i can stop doing that, (looks at the fridge) i really, really think i can!
(goes towards joey) you know that is not the reason joe. (joey hugs him and after, he takes something from the fridge and puts it in his mouth. he goes back to where he was standing before)
we think if you saw it, you would understand. i mean you guys were there. (points to rachel and phoebe) it is beautiful, is not it?
yeah it is.
what the hell are you doing?
well, it is, all right? when we were out there today, all i kept thinking was: i can not believe chandler is screwing this woman, but man this would be a nice place to live!
yeah, but so is this.
yeah, i mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. i mean, how can you leave this place?
(talking on the phone) c'mon daddy, listen to me! all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you are a shoe! you are a shoe, you are a shoe, you are a shoe!'. and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i do not want to be a shoe? what if i want to be a- a purse, y'know? or a- or a hat! no, i do not want you to buy me a hat, I am saying that i am a ha- it is a metaphor, daddy!
you can see where he would have trouble.
well maybe I will just stay here with monica.
well, i guess we have established who is staying here with monica...
that money is mine, green!
you are fly is open, geller!
you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?
hey, that is...'joincidence' with a 'c'!
[looking outside the window] eww, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.
ow, that had to hurt!
hey, it is your thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
okay, rachel, you want to put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
no mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. i want to do this.
every year.
(he has a turkey on his head) it is stuck!!!
(walks him to the kitchen) easy. step. how did it get on?
i put it on to scare chandler!
oh my god! monica's going to totally freak out!
it smells really bad in here.
well, of course it smells really bad. you have your head inside a turkey's ass!
hey, did you get the turkey bast-oh my god! oh my god! (she sees someone is stuck in the turkey.) who is that?
it is joey.
i got it! how about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
oooohh that is interesting.
if you win, we give up the birds.
(shocked) dah!! (chandler motions for him to calm down.)
but if we win, we get your apartment.
oooooh!
deal!
what was monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
big fat goalie.
correct. rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
dangerous liaisons.
correct. her actual favorite movie is...
weekend at bernie’s.
monica categorizes her towels. how many categories are there?
everyday use.
fancy.
guest.
fancy guest.
two seconds...
uhh, 11!
11, unbelievable, 11 is correct. (the guys celebrate.)
(to the girls) chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
14?
no, 19.
thanks man.
joey had an imaginary childhood friend. his name was?
maurice.
correct, his profession was?
space cowboy!
correct! what is chandler bing’s job?
ow...oh gosh!
10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
it is umm, it has something to do with transponding.
oh-oh-oh, he is a transponce—transpondster!
that is not even a word!
nooooooooo!!!!!
y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
hey, do not get mad at us! no one forced you to raise the stakes!
that is not true. she did! she forced me!
hey, we would still be living here if had not gotten the question wrong!
well it stupid, unfair question!
do not blame the questions!
would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!
chandler!!! chandler!!! (he opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; chandler and monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) chandler, i saw what you were doing through the window! chandler, i saw what you were doing to my sister! now get out here!
(to monica) wow! listen, we had a good run. you know, what was it? four? five months? i mean, that is more than most people have in a lifetime! so, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (he kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window)
(she opens the door.) hey ross. what is up bro?
what the hell are doing?!!
(running from the guy's apartment with joey in tow) hey, what is-what is going on?!
well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica.
(panicking) dude! he is right there!
(to chandler) i thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! my best friend and my sister! i-i cannot believe this!
look, we are not just messing around! i love her. okay, I am in love with her.
I am so sorry that you had to find out this way. I am sorry, but iit-t's true, i love him too.
(happily) my best friend and my sister! i cannot believe this. (he hugs them both.)
well, this is the last box of your clothes. I am just going to label it, "what were you thinking?"
funny, because i was just going to go across the hall and write that on chandler.
ok, you guys, i do not mean to make things worse, but umm, i do not want to live with rachel anymore.
you are just so mean to each other! and i do not want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!
well, phoebe that is fine because I am not moving.
whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you got to take her! y’know, i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she will fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I would like.
what else?
when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.
that is nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.
when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
well y’know, i do not want you to be cold.
and when i told her that i was going to be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive. (to rachel) (starts to cry) you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!! (they both break down in tears.)
(entering) hey.
she really left.
i know. (he kisses her.)
thank you.
no problem roomie. (she turns around and hugs him.)
can i ask you a question?
sure!
what the hell is that dog doing here?! (she notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
little toast here. i know this is not exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you would gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you did not have syphilis and stuff, we would not be all together, you know? so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.
and hey, here is to a lousy christmas.
and a crappy new year.
here, here!
you can not move. you just... you just can not.
rachel's right. this is where you guys belong.
yeah, you do not want to live in westchester. that is like the worst of the chesters.
you know, sometimes when I am alone in my apartment, i look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching tv or something, but... it makes me feel better. and now when i look over, who am i going to see? the gottliebs, the yangs? they do not make me feel so good. (joey pats ross on his back)
yeah. so do not move, okay? just stay here and... (nods towards ross) maybe close your blinds at night.
hello? it is nancy, they responded to our offer.
and?
(to nancy) okay, thanks... (to monica) they passed. they said they would not go a penny under the asking price.
we can not afford that.
i know.
well, there you go.
I am really sorry you guys.
yeah. I am sorry too. I am even more sorry that that phone call did not come before i told you about looking through the window.
yeah, we are going to let you be alone.
(to monica) you are going to be okay?
yeah, we will be okay.
love you guys. (he kisses monica, he, rachel and phoebe leave.)
you know, I am really sorry i was not more supportive before.
that is okay, we understand.
and about this nancy thing... if you are not sleeping with her, should i?
i know there will be other houses, but it is just so... i love that one so much.
yeah... well, it is a good thing we got it then.
what?
we got the house.
oh my god!
i just did not want to tell you in front of them.
oh my god! my god! we have got the house !?
we are getting the house. (they hug) we are getting the house.
and a baby...
we are growing up.
we sure are.
so who is going to tell them?
(quickly) not it!
not it! damn it!
rachel, this is yours.
aah! why? what are these for?
you will see.
all right, everybody open them!
ooh! oh wow this is so beautiful. (she got a scarf)
oh! these are the ones i was looking at in the store. (she got earrings)
i know.
i love this. (he got a sweater)
a meatball sub? thanks! (he got a meatball sandwich)
seriously you guys, what is going on? what are these for?
well, i did not know how to tell you before, but... we got the house.
enjoy!
(speaking with his mouth full, enjoying his sandwich) what did they say?
what are you doing?
i...reorganized the fridge. see, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. (there is nothing on the shelf.) middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. (there is one lone tomato.) and top shelf: expired products. (the shelf is jammed packed.)
why are you doing this?
because i am bored...out of my mind. I have already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. you have got to spread it out a little, you know. have not you ever been unemployed?
hey, i am not unemployed. I am on sabbatical!
hey, do not get religious on me, ok. (ross looks a little confused.) a guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. you know. why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? huh...come here…sit down. (ross sits down.) ready? (joey flips the foot rest up.) ahh!! (he reclines the chair fully.) ohh, yeah!! huh?!
so what, we just sit?
ohh, no, no. we are not going to just sit. (joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) shhh. (it begins to ring.)
(answering the phone at work) hello, chandler bing.
(in a high pitched female voice) hello mr. bing...i love you.
(angrily) alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (ross and joey laugh silently.) it is been six months! it is not funny!
but, i love you.
leave me alone! for the love of god, leave me alone!!! (joey hangs up.)
and that is wednesday. (he reclines in his chair.) ohh.
hey you guys, guess what?
the british are coming?
ohh, you and your ways. (she shakes the bell at him and sits down.) since it is christmastime. I am going to be one of those people collection donations.
(excitedly) yeah, i already have my bell and later on...i get my bucket.
ohh.
yeah, yeah, I am going to be out there spreading joy to the people. i mean, last year, i spread a little joy but not really enough. so this year, I am going to do the whole city.
you know, i knew a girl in high school who did that. she was very popular. (chandler laughs.)
so pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
ohh, they gave me a great spot. right by macys. yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I am the only one who can sing "merry christmas" in 25 languages. (she smirks.) i lied.
oh my god. ok you guys, there is danny. watch. just watch this. (he walks past the couch to the counter.) see?! still pretending he is not interested. ohh, he is coming over. just pretend like we do not know him. we have forgotten who he is.
danny? you know rachel? she is nice. she is not bad to look at, right?
thanks, mon.
do you want to go out on a date with her?
monica!!!
friday’s perfect...she can not wait.
(somewhat angrily) okay. what the hell was that? you know what? do not answer me. (giggling) i have a date with danny.
how could i not get the part? the play was about a 29-year-old italian actor from queens.
she is a woman!
(very discouraged) okay, is there anything else?
happy holidays. feliz navidad. allo, and merry christmas. (a man put some change in her bucket.) ohh thank you sir. here is some joy. (she waves her hand up and down as if she is spreading joy.)
(walking in from off screen.) phoebe!
hey!
i just wanted to see how it is going.
well, it is going okay.
(taking out her wallet.) well good, here let me help you out.
oh, thanks!
yeah!
wow!
is that a new swede jacket? it looks really expensive.
yeah. i guess. (she puts more money in the bucket.)
just get your nails done?
yes phoebe, but this is all i have. okay? (she pours out the rest of her change purse into the bucket.)
okay! thanks! happy holidays, here is your joy. (she waves her arm and spreads her joy.)
thank you! and happy holidays.
wait, you can not take the money out.
but, can not you leave the dollar? this money is for the poor.
okay, seasons greetings and everything, but still…
oh, I am going to give him something else besides joy, just… (she scowls at him.)
that part was perfect for me! i can not believe i did not get it!
I am sorry, man. hey, y'know what you should do? you should make something happen for yourself. y'know, like-like write a play. write a movie! huh? i mean, what about those good will hunting guys?
come on ross be realistic, y'know? if i did write something, what are the chances i could get those guys to star in it?
wait a second, i could star in it!
or that.
i can not write! y'know i mean i-i-I am an actor, i do not have the discipline that takes, y'know? i can not do it.
I will help you. yeah, I will make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. and plus, it will give me something to do.
really? you would-you would do that for me?!
yeah!
thanks!
(grabbing a notepad and sitting down) all right, we will start off slow. the only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
done!
and it can not be joey.
it is not.
or joseph.
(disappointed) oh.
hey, what is up?
i just saw danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
oh, honey, I am sorry.
well, you should be, this is all your fault! you meddled in our relationship!!
you had no relationship!!
no, but i was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
oh god, stop with the plan! so what, so what you saw him with a girl? who cares?! that does not mean anything! now look, you are going to go out on a date with danny and you are going to be so charming he is going to forget all about that stupid subway girl.
she was kind of stupid. you are right. all right, I am just going to go on the date. I am going to go on the date. that is the new plan.
come on, hurry!
hey, how do you spell suspicious?
why?
because i think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
yes! chandler bing, 7! chandler bing, 0.
you are driving me crazy with that!
okay, I will stop.
do not stop! move the bowl further away! ross could make that shot!
well, you suck! but at least you suck at a man's game now.
you want to play?
chandler, i can not be playing games, ross is going to be home soon. and i have to write five whole pages if I am going to stick to his schedule.
well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
(jumping up) all right! but uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I am intrigued.
all right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
okay, but be careful okay, because i want to get our security deposit back.
yeah, i think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
uh yeah, right here. (he punches his fist through the wall next to the door.)
thank you, happy holidays.
now, that is trash. young lady, you can not… (the lady ignores her and walks off.) hey! stop that young lady, she donated trash!
hey!! (the bucket starts smoking.) the charity's on fire! help! (yet another guy walks by carrying a cup, which phoebe grabs.) oh good! thank you, i need that. (she throws onto the smoldering fire. suddenly the bucket erupts in flames.) whoa! what is that?! (she sniffs the cup.) (to the guy.) it is nine of the clock in the morning!
all right. (reading.) a room. a man enters, he looks suspicious. (stops reading a flips the page to find the next one is blank.) that is it? (joey shrugs.) joey, you are supposed to have five pages done by now! including an exciting incident! (flipping through the rest of the pad.) and what is, and what is all this?! (reading.) the official rulebook of fireball.
yeah, that is the uh, game we were playing.
(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) oh yeah, it is great! see you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid—op! op! (he puts out a small fire which has re-ignited in his room.)
this is helping your career?! huh? i thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
you are right, you are right, I will get back to work.
(to chandler) and shame on you! you should know better, joey needs to work. (to joey) now come on!
hey!
no! ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! you can have this back when the five pages are done! (after joey walks past, ross throws the ball down in pain.) ahh! (chandler shows him the burn spots on his oven mitts.)
so did i. I am really glad monica asked us out.
you are sister? you are sister's asleep on the couch? (danny nods, "yes.") ohhh! i saw her with you on the subway and now she is asleep on the couch!
hi!
(not sure what to do) uh, it was very nice meeting you. (they continue to ignore her.)
nobody! nobody respects the bucket! you would not believe what people put in here! look! (hands it to monica.) okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
no.
does it look like an ashtray?
no.
does it look like a urinal?
eww!! (throws the bucket down.)
so pheebs, are you going to go back out there or what?
well, yeah! but I am not going to take anymore crap. okay? no more mrs. nice bucket!
yeah, good for you. y'know you are tough, you lived on the streets.
yeah, I am going to go back to being street phoebe. yeah! oh but, y'know what? i can not go totally back because street phoebe really would not be friends with you guys. sorry. (leaves.)
(entering from her room) hey!
hey!
hey, umm, can i ask you guys something?
uh, i do not have any brothers so i do not know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
oh-oh, yeah.
all the time. in fact, i was undefeated.
uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
still, i was quick as a cat.
well, i met danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
oh, you are kidding.
yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley. but, i guess that is normal?
(laughing with ross) we do not, we do not wrestle now.
yeah, not since i got too strong for you.
too strong for me?
yeah.
you want to go right now? because I will take you right now, buddy! you want to go?
oh fine.
ready? (they grab a hold of each other's necks.) wrestle! (they start wrestling.)
okay, y'know what uh, actually, that is great. that helps a lot. thanks. (she leaves them to wrestle.)
(entering from his bedroom) guys, come on! let us go! the puck drops in 20 minutes! come on, joe!
joey's not going.
(to chandler) i did not finish my five pages.
well, why can not you do them tomorrow?
because tomorrow he is redoing yesterday's pages.
yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
(to ross) why do not you cut him a little slack? okay? maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he will get some work done.
i think he is been relaxing enough, thanks to you and fireball.
dude, if you think fireball's relaxing, you have obviously have never played.
the only reason you are doing this to joey is because you are bored. okay, it is not his fault that you are unemployed.
i am not unemployed. I am on sabbatical!
come on look guys, do not fight.
and the reason I am doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you would be doing the same thing.
oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
if it does? then you are an amazing friend of mine.
hey-hey guys, hey! how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball? huh? I will go unhook the smoke detectors!
how about we settle this right now! (he rips up the tickets.) there! now, no one's going to the game. ha-ha-ha!
i paid for those tickets!
no you did not. you said you would, but you never did!
oh yeah! (makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
when did that happen to you?!
do not you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—i did not have my camera!
oh yeah. first off all, chasing the churo guy is not jogging.
oh, great!
okay, bye! (to the gang.) oh my god!!
that was unbelievable!
okay, see? i told you!
yeah, wow, sorry rach.
i do not believe they are brother and sister.
they are brother and sister!!!
oh whoa-whoa-whoa! wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. (the lady opens up her hand.) quarter. dime. lint? not interested in that. (she throws the lint away.) what is this? a canadian coin? get outta here! (the lady walks away.)
whoa-whoa-whoa! no drinks near the bucket! set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! (the guy starts to walk away with a hurt look on his face.) and you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! (her boss and a co-worker walk up.) hi bob! (the same old lady from before walks bye.) (to the old lady.) i thought i told you to get outta here!
what?!
that chick can not handle my corner.
fine. (she hands her bell to ginger and starts to take down her signs.) (the same old lady walks by again.) all right, I will give you one pointer. look out for that bitch. (the old lady.)
yeah uh, y'know what uh, let us skip it.
umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…
well, okay, look. i do not know, listen, i do not know what is going on here but let us…
no, i have two sisters. but one of them has a very masculine energy.
no-no, they are not very nice people.
well, uh, i-i do not know. see when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…
yeah, okay, I will see you later. (gets up and runs from the apartment.)
oh hey! there is some kids playing in the street, you want to go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, going to need stitches ball.
(entering) hey guys! i was at the library all morning and i already finished my five pages for today!
yay!
great! now, we can go to the ranger game! (pause) last night!
no dude, ross tore up the tickets!
i guess when you do not have so many distractions, it is easier for you to focus. huh?
yeah or also when you do not have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day!!
yeah, well, that is fine, but the important thing is that i finished it. and uh, i think it is really good, but y'know it would really help me is if i could hear it. so would you guys read it for me?
all right. (takes a copy.)
all right. (takes another copy.)
okay. (reading.) "it is a typical new york city apartment. two guys are hanging out." ross (points to him.)
hey man.
what is up?
about yesterday, i was really wrong. i am sorry.
no, it was me. I am sorry. i over reacted.
maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest… (pauses and looks at joey.) but we had our best friend's interest at heart.
could i be more sorry. (looks at joey.)
i do not know, I am one sorry polentologist. (stops reading.) all right joey, we get it. (to chandler) I am sorry.
(to ross) I am sorry too.
oh no! no-no, keep reading! the good part's coming up. keep going.
(reading from the script.) i am sorry, chandler.
i am sorry, ross.
a handsome man enters. (playing the part of the handsome man.) hey! how is it going guys? i do not know what you two were talking about, but I would like to say thanks to both of you. you, (ross) you would not let me give up on myself, and you (chandler) well you co-created fireball. the end.
this took you all day?!
no-no, this only took five minutes. i spent the rest of the day coming up with new, ultimate fireball. (takes out a bowling ball and a propane torch.) ha-ha!
(reading the scene set up.) okay, it is a typical new york city apartment. two girls are just hanging out.
hi, how are you doing kelly?
I am doing just fine! god, tiffany, you smell so great!
it is my new perfume. why do not you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
oh, y'know joey, you are sick!
this is disgusting!
I am not reading this!
what?! wait-wait-wait! the handsome man was about to enter!!
let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? i remember when people used to use big lights.
that is a good story, grandpa.
hey
wow, monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! did someone get her drunk again or?
having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about. it is about being with the people that you love.
that is nice and we are done. tada!
i dunno what it is, it just does not quite feel like christmas to me.
oh, here.
see now it feels like christmas!
… and that is the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago.
so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
hey you guys.
hey joe what is up?
i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. y’know, everywhere i look she is like… (he imitates her stretching)
i can see why that is hard to resist.
i like her so much!
aw, I am sorry sweetie that she does not feel the same way.
i know. and she is so sweet. i just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.
you are aware that she is not a monkey, right?
i am so over janine. i mean, yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now she is like old news!
hi janine!
hold it! are you talking about dick clark’s new year’s rocking eve?
oh my god! we love that show! i mean ross and i have been watching it since i can remember!
ah, you are still just a little fat girl inside are not you? (he kisses her on the cheek)
you are going to be a party person! those guys rock the most!
totally! i would love to spend new year’s with you.
oh, well you see how it works is, the part with dick clark in times square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. yeah, not a lot of people know that.
are you serious?
we are there!
what, what are you laughing at?
well, i used to date him, but you are still going out with her!
bye janine!
did she just ask me out on a date?
i do not think so.
what are you talking about? she just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
yeah, but she also invited you and ross. yeah, honey, I am sorry, but i do not think that was a romantic thing.
oh. maybe. but hey i know how i can find out. we are going to a new year’s eve party, right? so at midnight, i can kiss her. and if she kisses me back, great! y’know? but if she says ‘dude, what the hell are you doing?’ i can say ‘it was not me, it was new years!’
well, that is a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
it was a dry day.
we are going to dick clark’s new year’s rocking eve!
oh my god!
oh my god!
(to rachel) oh my god!
ok, listen I have been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? it is a show, but we are just dancing, ok? it is no big deal. the important thing to remember – stay cool.
got it!
oh my god it is just like i dreamed it!
yeah, i have a question. when is this going to air?
ross! so when is it going to air?
okay, you look in the kitchen, i will look in the back closet.
i can save you time ladies, I am right here.
yeah, chandler why do not you take a walk? this does not concern you.
we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.
what? that is terrible!
no-no, we do it every year!
oh well, that makes it not terrible.
no, yeah, we never find them! she is always best at us that wily minx.
do not worry, we are just going to search here for an hour, them we are going to go over to joey’s and search, ok?
no not okay, you can not look for monica’s presents!
but we have to!
no, you do not have to, and you can not because i live here too.
well then, you should look with us.
why?
chandler, are not you worried about what to get monica for christmas?
no, i have a great idea for a present for her.
oh, that is it? (mimics chandler) a great idea!
chandler, that is not enough. i mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? and you have just gotten her one great present? i mean that is just going to make her feel bad. why would you do that to her chandler? why? why?
if i help, we can find ‘them faster!
that is right!
ooh ooh, we have a live one!
oh, it is a macy’s bag!
ooh, who is it for?
(reading) dear losers, do you really think I would hide presents under the couch? p.s. chandler, i knew they would break you.
uh-oh. she may be onto us.
we are so going to find them this year.
y’know when you guys said you were going to go across the hall and look, you do not, you do not do that every year do you?
yeah.
you do not, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
because that is where joey gave me some stuff to store that I have never seen before in my life! okay, that did not just happen! (he does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kind of hard to describe.)
okay, here comes another camera.
right. no biggie. stay loose.
why do they keep doing that?
if we want to get on camera, i think we have to get up on one of those platforms. they have been taping those people up there all day.
right.
hey, what did you guys do to get up on there?
oh yeah? well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
yeah!
really?
what do you mean?
uh-huh.
no-no-no-no-no we came together!
no-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, i really like her and i think i have a shot.
i could not find anything at joey--hey-hey, oh hey!
yeah, we found them. there were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they are all crap!
those are my gifts, i got them for you.
ohhh. thanks chandler they are great!
well chandler, what is this very weird, metal a z thing?
those are book ends! that is a great gift!
oh, okay, I am sorry, thank you for my azzz.
ha!
make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
yes, okay, oh, by the way, i just got to say, i think it is really nice of you that even after you have moved, you still keep storing that stuff for joey!
hey-hey dancer girl! can i go to the bathroom? i just.. (the girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) here we go. (he walks away to find monica and ross doing a really out of place dance) looking good gellers!
we know!
hey, see that snippy guy over there? he is the one who decides who gets up on the platform. we should go dance by him.
okay.
excuse me, sir, would it help if i were not wearing underpants?
monica! (pause) would it?
hey! tall guy! hey, listen, i wanted to talk to you about that girl that you are dancing with.
yeah, yeah, okay. uh, look buddy, i came with that girl, and i had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I am trying to win her over, so i was wondering if..
oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she is real, uh, mellow!
well, i was hoping after tonight that maybe i could you know…
alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if you are right, you are right, what can i say, but hey oh no! (he throws water on the guy’s pants)
hey, now you are the one who wet his pants. (he throws another handful on him and runs out)
man, this sucks! y’know if mom and dad do not see us on tv after we made them so jealous, i mean, who is going to be the losers then?
hey, i know what will get us up on a platform!
what?
the routine!
ross, we have not done the routine since middle school.
hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he will want to build us our own platform!
was it really that good?
we got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! look, it is almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
okay, let us do it. mom and dad are going to be so faced!
5 6 7 8!
so, do we really have to ask who is going up on the platform next?
yes! (they run over to a platform)
uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! i mean, i know you told us to show excitement, but do not you think he went a little overboard?
yeah, take a hike wetpants!
can you believe this? we are going to be on the platform for the millennium moment!
i know! hey, you have not been practising the routine, have you?
no!
me too!
hey, when the music starts up again, i was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know? (he mimics a robot)
ross, i think we should stick to the routine, we do not want to look stupid!
no! year! happy no year!
hey! look who i found!
oh, hey guys!
y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and i thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? no! did not think so! okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!
oh, the duck seems to think that monica got me garbage! hmm, i wonder what i could get monica that is as good as garbage?
hmm, how about my azzz?
hey, this is hollow.
what?
this bench, it is hollow! i can not believe i never knew that! (she pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) oh, the presents!!!
no, do not look directly at them!
what?
alright, no, we could look at them!
oh, this one’s for me!
oh, this one’s for chandler. here.
oh great!
and the big one’s for me!
ooh, let us open them!
okay! okay! okay!
hee hee!
wait, we can not do this.
i do not want to know what monica got me. y’know? i mean, look, I am sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are going to ruin that, and i, look we have to put these back, this is not what christmas is about.
whatever linus, I am opening mine.
nobody is opening anything ok? look, i do not know about you guys, but i want to see the look on monica’s face when i give her my present, and I am sure she wants to see the look on my face when i get mine. so please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
will you get us better gifts?
fine!
hey guys! you found the presents? chandler, you let them find the presents? great! do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
that is what you got me?
oh yes, i see what you mean. that look is priceless.
home sweet home, huh? nice to, uh, get back to reality. plus we know how the new year’s going to go off. i guess there is no reason for all that y2k panic, y’know? anyway, g’night!
yeah?
oh, yoii. what was that for?
really? in the moment, i really wanted to kiss you too. in the moment.
but only in the moment. so do ya want to kiss again?
no.
3, 2,
uh, yeah, okay. except i sorta felt like i needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
we were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new millennium, and the guy yelled ‘cut!’
uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
yeah. but of course we had to update it a little bit. (to ross) hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!
‘cos i was going to say there is no way you could have done the end the way you guys did it back then!
what? we could do it!
i do not know, i mean you were a lot bigger, i mean, stronger back then.
i can do it, okay? come on, let us go. (she and ross get up)
i can not do it! (ross falls into monica’s room)
now you do that, you are on tv.
alright. phoebe?
okay, okay. if i were omnipotent for a day, i would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...and bigger boobs!
yeah, see.. you took mine. chandler, what about you?
uh, if i were omnipotent for a day, I would.. make myself omnipotent forever.
see, there is always one guy. (mocking) "if i had a wish, I would wish for three more wishes." (joey enters.)
hey, joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
probably kill myself!
..excuse me?
hey, if little joey's dead, then i got no reason to live!
joey, uh- omnipotent.
you are? ross, I am sorry..
how does she do that?
i cannot sleep in a public place.
would you look at her? she is so peaceful.
(waking and startling them) oh! what what what! ...hi.
it is okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
what is going on with you?
i got no sleep last night!
why?
my grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they are both kind of insecure in bed. oh, and deaf. so they are constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they are having a good time. you have no idea how loud they are!
well, if you want, you can stay with rachel and me tonight.
thanks.
...ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. see, i told you! less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
you got waaaay too much free time.
(to ross) hey! here is the birthday boy! ross, check it out: hockey tickets, rangers-penguins, tonight at the garden, and we are taking you.
happy birthday, pal!
we love you, man. (kisses ross)
funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
so?
so, I am guessing you had an extra ticket and could not decide which one of you got to bring a date?
well, are not we mr. "the glass is half empty."
oh my god, oh- is today the twentieth, october twentieth?
oh, i was hoping you would not remember.
ohhh.
what is wrong with the twentieth?
eleven days before halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
today's the day carol and i first.. consummated our physical relationship. (joey is puzzled.) sex. ..you know what, i-I would better pass on the game. i think I am just going to go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
the hell with hockey, let us all do that!
(trying to stop ross leaving) c'mon, ross! you, me, joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (pretending to punch him in the stomach.) huh? huh? huh?
what are you doing?
(stops) i have no idea.
c'mon, ross!
alright, alright, maybe it will take my mind off it. do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
you got it.
look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! look at the window, there is my name! hi, me!
i remember the day i got my first pay check. there was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
wow, you worked in a mine?
i worked in a dairy queen, why?
god, is not this exciting? i earned this. i wiped tables for it, i steamed milk for it, and it was totally—(opens envelope)—not worth it. who is fica? why is he getting all my money? i mean, what- chandler, look at that.
(looking) oh, this is not that bad.
oh, you are fine, yeah, for a first job.
you can totally, totally live on this.
yeah, yeah.
oh, by the way, great service tonight.
oh my god! (rachel, leslie, kiki, and joanne all scream and hug each other.
(to phoebe) i swear I have seen birds do this on wild kingdom.
what are you guys doing here?
(to a pregnant leslie) look at you, you are so big i can not believe it!
(to joanne) so what is going on with you?
(to monica) look, look, i have elbows! (they scream.)
...poulet passes it up to leetch! (passes it to joey.)
leetch spots messier in the crease- there is the pass! (he kicks it to ross, but ross is staring into a shop window.)
we will take a brief time out while messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. fact, she, uh- she never took'them off, because we-we- (off chandler's look) sorry. sorry.
what?
peach pit.
yes, bunny?
(points) peach pit. that night we, uh- we had-
-peaches?
actually, nectarines, but basically...
(to joey) could have been a peach.
then, uh, then we got dressed, and i-i... i walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I am fine.
hey, that woman's got an ass like carol's! (they turn to stare at him.) what? thought we were trying to find stuff.
so c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
okay.
what? guys, I am not.
I am not! this is what I am doing now. I have got this job-
okay, I am not just waitressing. I am.. i, um... i write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and i, uh... i take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... oh, and, um, sometimes artelle let us me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
hey, rach. how was it with your friends? (she and phoebe scream.) okay! how would you like some tiki death punch? (she pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)
what is that?
weeeell, it is rum, and-
okay. (grabs the blender and starts to drink.)
we thought since phoebe was staying over tonight we would have kind of like a slumber party thing. we got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got twister... (the phone rings and monica answers it.)
ooh! ooh! and i brought operation! but, um, i lost the tweezers, so we can not operate. but we can prep the guy!
uh, rach, it is the visa card people.
oh, god, ask them what they want.
(on phone) could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (listens) yes, hold on. (to rachel) um, they say there is been some unusual activity on your account.
but i have not used my card in weeks!
that is the unusual activity. look, they just want to see if you are okay.
they want to know if I am okay. okay.. they want to know if I am okay, okay, let us see. well, let us see, the fica guys took all my money, everyone i know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I am getting coffee! and it is not even for me! so if that sounds like I am okay, okay, then you can tell them I am okay, okay?
(pauses then on the phone) uh- rachel has left the building, can you call back?
alright, c'mon! (miserably) let us play twister!
(squeezing past people) sorry, sorry... uh-oh.
what? there was ice there that night with carol? plastic seats? four thousand angry pittsburgh fans?
no, actually i was just saying it looks like we are not sitting together. but now you mention it, there was ice there that night... it was the first frost...
c'mon, sit. just sit down, sit.
you should feel great about yourself! you are doing this amazing independence thing!
monica, what is so amazing? i gave up, like, everything. and for what?
you are just like jack.
...jack from downstairs?
no, jack and the beanstalk.
ah, the other jack.
yeah, right! see, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. and then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. and he lived in a village, and you live in the village..
okay, but pheebs, pheebs, jack gave up a cow, i gave up an orthodontist. okay, i-i-i know, i know i did not love him-
oh, see, jack did love the cow.
but see, it was a plan. y'know, it was clear. it was figured out, and now everything's just kind of like...
floopy?
yeah.
so what, you are not the only one. i mean, half the time we do not know where we are going. you have just got to figure at some point it is all going to come together, and it is just going to be... un-floopy.
oh, like that is a word.
okay, but monica, what if- what if it does not come together?
...pheebs?
oh, well... because.... you just... i do not like this question.
okay, see, see, you guys, what if we do not get magic beans? i mean, what if all we have got are.. beans?
get him! get him! get him! get- yesss! not laughing now, are ya pal!
(to ross) see buddy, that is all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
pass it! pass it!
he is open!
hey, look, we are on that tv thing!
(to the receptionist)'scuse me.
listen, it is kind of an emergency. well, i guess you know that, or we would be in the predicament room. (the receptionist glares at him.)
(jumping to his feet) look, i do not want to make any trouble, okay, but I am in a lot of pain here, alright? my face is dented.
well, how long do you think it will be?
hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) heyy...
I am so sorry, you guys. i did not mean to bring you down.
no, you were right. i do not have a plan. (there is a knock on the door.)
thank god. food. (she goes to answer the door.)
phoebe?
what?
do you have a plan?
i do not even have a 'pl'.
(miserably) no, no, that is not what we ordered... we ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
(leaping off of the couch and runs up) wait! did you say 'g.stephanopoulos?'
wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
and-and a power tie?
(staggered) oh god.
are you nuts?! we have got george stephanopoulos' pizza! (rachel pays him, monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)
uh, pheebs? who is george snuffalopagus?
big bird's friend.
i see pizza!
oh, i want to see! lemme see! lemme see! (she runs up and takes the binoculars.)
hello? who are we spying on?
white house adviser? clinton's campaign guy? the one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
oh, him, the little guy? oh, i love him!
ooh, wait.. wait, i see a woman.
please tell me it is his mother.
definitely not his mother.
oh, no...
oh, wait, she is walking across the floor.. she is walking.. she is walking.. she is going for the pizza- (yelling) hey, that is not for you, bitch! (phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
excuse me, look, we have been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. i mean, that guy with the toe thing? who is he sleeping with? (she slides the gladd panel over and chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) oh, c'mon dora, do not be mad... i know we both said some things we did not mean, but that does not mean we still do not love each other. (to the waiting room.) y'know, i feel like I have lost her.. (she slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) ba-!
light still out?
yeah.
oh. maybe they are- napping.
oh please, they are having sex.
so, whaddya think george is like?
i think he is shy.
yeah?
yeah. i think you have to draw him out. and then- when you do- he is a preppy animal.
i remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- could i get some painkillers over here, please?
he is right, enough, already. what is the big deal about today? so you slept with her for the first time, so what? you slept with her for seven years after that.
look, it is just a little more complicated...
well, what? what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women? that she left you for another woman that likes women?
little louder, okay, i think there is a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that did not quite hear you...
then what?
my first time with carol was... (he mumbles the last part)
what?
it was my first time.
with carol? (ross gives him a look.) oh.
so in your whole life, you have only been with one—(he gets a look too)—oh.
whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! there was a whole bunch of stuff we could have done tonight!
okay. okay, i got one. do you remember that vegetarian pate that i made that you loved so much?
uh-huh.
well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
oh! oh! oh! okay, fine, fine. now i do not feel so bad about sleeping with jason hurley.
what?! you slept with jason?
you would already broken up.
how long?
a couple hours.
oh, that is nice!
okay, okay, okay, i got one! (she sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) anyway- the valentine tommy rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
excuse me?!
hello? like he was really going to send you one? (to phoebe) she was a big girl.
really. well, at least 'big girls' do not pee in their pants in seventh grade!
i was laughing! you made me laugh! (monica and rachel start to squabble)
there he is! there he is!
where?
right- where we have been looking all night!
he is so cute!
oh, george, baby, drop the towel!
man. can you believe he is only had sex with one woman?
i think it is great. y'know, it is sweet, it is romantic...
really?
no, you kidding? the guy's a freak.. (ross enters off camera)
hi. (he is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.  he tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs. oh come on, admit it! all things considered, you had fun tonight.
fun? where was the fun? tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? where is my puck?
oh, ah- the kid has it.
the kid...? (to the kid) excuse me, uh, that is, that is my puck.
you got to do it, man.
(to the kid) oh yeah? well, I am rubber, you are glue, whatever—(to chandler)—can not do it. (to the kid) listen, uh- give me back my puck.
'yes', how about. c'mere. give me!
(tries to snatch it from the kid) give me my puck!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
...now that was fun.
(doing the spinning) okay, monica: right foot red.
could have played monopoly, but nooooo.
thanks. (the guy nods and leaves)
okay, pheebs: right hand blue. (phoebe has to bend over.)good. (joey stares at her butt appreciatively)
hello? oh, uh, rachel, it is the visa card people.
oh, okay. will you take my place?
alright. (on phone) yes, this is rachel.
nooo! (she grabs the phone and chandler takes her place on the mat.) (on phone) hello? (listens) oh, yeah, no, i know, i-i have not been using it much. (listens) oh, well, thanks, but, I am okay, really.
green. to the green.
(on phone) I have got magic beans. (listens) never-never mind.
to the left, to the left- aww! (they all collapse)
(on phone) ohhh... I am fine.
hey, what is going on?
hey.
i found a note on my door, "come to monica’s quick, bring champagne and a three musketeers bar."
(grabbing the candy bar) yeah I will take that.
what is up?
monica and i are engaged.
oh my god. (hugs chandler.) congratulations.
thanks.
where is she?
(yelling at the top of her lungs) I am engaged!!!!!! I am engaged!!!!
yeah, she is been out there for twenty minutes, I am surprised you did not hear her on the way over.
oh, i thought it was just a kid yelling, "I am gay! I am gay!" can i bring her in?
oh no, let her stay out there. it is sweet.
I am getting married!!!! I am going to be a bride!!!! (someone else yells at her.) no, i will not shut up because I am engaged! (he yells again.) ohh, big talk! huh, why do not you come over here and say that to me?! huh, buddy?! yeah, my fiancee will kick your ass! (chandler starts to look worried.) come on, apartment 20! apartment 20!
(to ross) okay, you get her in here. (to joey) you bolt the door. I will be in the closet.
okay! wait-wait-wait! shhh! (bangs on her class with a spoon to make a toast.) okay, umm, i just want to say that…i love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night. (chandler clears his throat.) our special night. i mean it just would not be my—our-our night, if you all were not here to celebrate with me—us—damnit!
it is okay, i want this to be your night too. (raises his class.) to monica.
awww, come on—wait—stop it. okay, to monica.
to monica!
so have you decided on a band for the wedding? because, y’know, I am kind of musical.
yeah pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. i doubt she is even had time to…
well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
(to monica) yeah, you are on your own.
y’know what we should do? we should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at the plaza.
but i-i-i can not stay too long, i got to get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and i got to look good. I am supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) what?
so when you said, "get up early," did you mean 1986?
you guys do not think i look 19?
oh, 19! we thought you said 90!
okay everybody, let us go! let us go!
okay.
okay.
(to phoebe) hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
oh honey no, you ate it all.
i was afraid of that.
(looking at her hand) y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? diamond shoes! (sees chandler sitting on the bed.) you are not getting dressed. (chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)
know what i mean?
yeah, but i do not think we have time.
there is going to be a wedding. you are going to be the bride. two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
(lustily) let us do it! (she kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)
(chasing after him) chandler! it happens to lots of guys! you-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, do not worry about it!
(motioning with his hands) I am not worried, I am uh, I am fascinated. y’know it is like uh, biology! which is funny because in high school i uh, i-i failed biology and tonight biology failed me. (exits as phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)
check it out. okay, i can play this when the guests are coming in. okay. (singing)
phoebe!
if you would have let me finish, it goes on to say that he is probably not gay.
sure, you guys do not have this problem, you are made of wood. (rachel comes out of the bathroom) hey!
hey!
you look great!
(quietly) oh, thanks.
you okay over there?
i do not know, y’know? i feel a little umm… no, y’know what? nevermind, I am going to be fine.
oh, do not worry about it i mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.
hey!
hi!
wow! happy monica’s night!
well thank you, you too.
thanks.
hey, do you believe this? do you believe they are actually getting married?
well sure. but i get married all the time so…
ohh…
you okay?
yeah, i guess. i-i… i mean, do-do you think we are ever going to have that?
you mean, we—you and me?
oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! we, you with someone and me with someone.
oh good, you scared me for a minute.
shake it off.
i mean—no, it is just ‘because, it is just because you and i were like a nightmare. (screams.) no, but there was some good times.
no, absolutely. y’know like it was umm…
surely you can think of something good.
yeah, just give me a minute! (thinking) oh well, yes, i can think of one good thing.
what?
well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
yeah? i was good at the stuff huh?
uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, i really liked your hands.
my hands?
yeah.
yeah?
uh-huh.
(to his hands) way to go guys. y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
oh, i know. hey, y’know what we never did? (ross looks at her.) oh no, not that. (ross nods okay.) we uh, we never had bonus night!
a what?
y’know, bonus night. y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
one night, just-just sex. no strings attached?
yeah-yeah, we never had that,
no.
okay, this is getting a little crazy. i mean, I am-I am sure it would be amazing but i…got to say i really-really do not think it would be a good idea. y’know? i really, really…do not.
‘sup? ‘sup dude?
(putting his hands up) take whatever you want, just please do not hurt me.
so you are playing a little playstation, huh? that is whack! playstation is whack! ‘sup with the whack playstation, ‘sup?! huh? come on, am i 19 or what?!
yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
come on man, really how old?!
young! you are a man-child okay?! now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
wow thanks! (he goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)
joe?
yeah!
uhh, you have had a lot of sex right?
when? today? some, not a lot.
well, it is just the reason that I am asking is because i kind of eh, uh, i was unable to—i mean i really wanted too, but i could not…. there huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
do not worry about that man, that happens.
it is happened to you?
yeah! once.
well, what did you do?
i did it anyway.
phoebe! come on! let us go! (knocks on her door.) come on! (phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) why are not you dressed yet?!
I am sorry, but i just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. check this out. (gets ready to play.)
(grabs the guitar away from her) no, phoebe, I will tell you what, if you get ready now I will let you play it at the wedding.
really?! oh that is so exciting! thank you! thanks mon! oh but mon, if you touch my guitar again I will have to pound on you for a little bit.
fair enough, now go get ready!
okay. (she goes to get ready.)
I will get everybody else (does so), finally we can start celebrating my—(she gasps and is stopped by the sight of ross and rachel making out in the hall.) I am sorry, uh apparently I have opened the door to the past.
okay, monica. mon, uh what-what you just saw…
(interrupting) can i ask you just a little question, huh? why tonight?
what?
see, I have been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I am only planning on doing this once. so, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I am sorry about it, but i was kind of hoping tonight could just be about that.
oh honey, but it is just about…
it is! it is!
no it is not! no! no! now it is about you and ross getting back together!
what?!
see yeah umm, you kind of stole my thunder!
okay! ho-ho! we did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
yeah. no. and you know what? nobody even saw!
yeah!
that is true.
honey i swear it we just kissed.
it was just a kiss. (phoebe enters and overhears this.)
you guys kissed!!!!! what does this mean?!! are you, are you getting back together?! can i sing at your wedding?
thunder being stolen!!
okay come on phoebe, it is nothing! monica, come on!
look let us not make a big deal out of this! it was a one time thing. it does not even matter!
oh my god! i cannot believe you guys are talking about this! the problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! all right?!! now chandler is doing the best he can!!
(angrily) i do not think that is what they were talking about joe!!
what a great night, chandler can not do it, these guys kissed… (points to ross and rachel.)
what?
what?!
you guys kissed! oh my—this is huge!
no!
oh no!
no-no, it is really not huge.
and; people thinking it is huge has led monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (to monica) which we are not!
well, we are still talking about it, are not we?
well yeah, that and chandler’s problem.
monica-monica-monica-monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about ross and rachel.
yes that would be lovely.
you got it. okay. now, i can pass for 19 right?!
yes, you can pass for 19.
really?
yes!
seriously?
seriously? seriously, no! you can play your own age which is 31!
(gasps) I am 30!
joey, you are not! you are 31.
(realizes) aww crap!
okay, so the plaza! okay, we will get us some mai thai’s, (to chandler) maybe no more for you though.
y’know what? i-i think that umm, i do not feel like going to the plaza.
why?!
honey, monica, this is ridiculous! look…
no-no, i-i really do not want to talk about it! i do not! (to rachel) especially with you. (goes into her room.)
psss, that is whack!
(she is strumming something) yeah? (joey nods yes.) okay, i think I will play it at the wedding.
yeah! well, i think we will see if they actually let you play. huh? i mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "you look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "no you do not."
well, i do not think monica is going to take this away.
would not she?
would she?
would she? (he smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) you ate my candy bar!
guess who? (enters fully.)
hey.
hey, i just realized we kind of let some stuff up in the air…
what do you think monica mean when she said she did not want to talk, especially with me? i mean, why not especially you and me? we were both out there kissing.
still thinking about it huh?
come on! serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (mimicking monica.) especially you!
(loosening his tie) oh, who cares?
i care!
(tightening his tie) and so do i.
y’know what, i-i have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
okay. sure. (sits down on her bed.)
am i going to let you watch me undress?
(sitting up) no! (exits.)
i can not believe her, y’know it is just—it is so typical.
now monica, i know you are upset, but do not forget. there is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there is going to be a honeymoon, maybe in paris.
paris?
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la (mumbles something).
keep talking.
then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because it is romantic, but because i can!
i love you!
(in a french accent) bonjour, monsieur.
okay, do not say anything, you might scare it away.
it is paris, who knows we are here!
(opening the door) hi pheebs, what is up? (she enters.)
okay, you said i could sing at your wedding so, I am just going to need a small deposit.
what?!
y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
pheebs, we are not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
oh, i see. (exits angrily.)
they break your heart, do not they?
y’know, i do not really their permission.
yeah! if you want to sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
yeah! and if you want to look 19, then you… you got to do something about your eyes.
what?! what is wrong with my eyes.
they give you away! there is just-there is just too much wisdom in there. (joey nods in agreement.) just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
and that will get rid of my wisdom?
maybe just 10 minutes for you.
oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i do not care!
yes.
monica, what did you mean before when you said you did not want to talk to anyone, especially me?
what a great apology! (to monica) and you accept! okay, bye-bye!
no-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
well, let us just say it is not the first time you have stolen my thunder.
what?!
(to rachel) hey, here is a thought.
monica, what are you talking about?
my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin charlie.
(entering) ahh, third base.
it is all everybody at the party could talk about!
monica, y’know what? the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring!
(gasps) we had a characturist!
oh!!
(singing, angrily)
monica, your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago.
and yet, here we are doing it again.
ugh, monica i do not want to steal your stupid thunder!
oh please! why else would you have made out with ross?!
got me. (he shows of his hands.)
all right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it are not going to happen!
i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night!
i swear, i never wanted any part of your night!
oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
uh, rachel, I have been thinking. i do not think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I am calling it off.
(to ross) why to save your dignity my man.
(ignoring them) monica, why? why would i ever want to take away from your night?
i do not know! i do not—maybe you are feeling a little resentful. maybe ah, maybe you thought you would get married first! maybe you can not stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
oh wow. that—y’know what? that is so unfair. y’know what? now i want to steal your thunder! come on ross, let us go have sex!
(yelling after them) i can not believe you are going to have sex on my engagement night!!
well, somebody should. (monica glares at him.)
look uh, if we are going to do this…
we are not going to do this, all right? she is just going to think that we are doing it.
oh, i see, so everybody wins.
who is it?
(outside the door) it is monica, open up!
okay well ross! stop it please! wait a minute! (motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. so she pokes him.)
oww!
yeah, you like that baby? (monica bursts in followed by chandler.) may we help you?
i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together, but i must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I am going to announce that I am pregnant!
how is that ever going to happen?!
all right monica, do you want to know why i was with ross tonight?!
i know why!
no you do not know why!
okay! why?!
because! because i was sad.
what do you mean?
look, i am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I am not. I am not even close. and i do not know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that that is dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler!
(to ross) i do not care, she slept with me.
anyway sweetie, i am, I am so sorry i ruined your night.
(starting to cry) I am sorry i almost made you sleep with ross. (they hug.)
(deadpan) well, I am going to take off. (to chandler) congratulations man.
thanks.
(at the door) and uh, rachel.
yeah.
what can i say, you missed your chance. from now on the only person who is going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)
(singing)
(interrupting her just in time) hey! here is a dollar, consider it a deposit. please sing at our wedding.
oh thank you.
okay. (goes back to bed.)
now… (starts singing again) "who will perform the ceremony! who will perform the cer—(chandler enters and grabs her guitar and closes the door behind him)—oh—oh! all right, I will pound on him in the morning.
hey you guys?
what?
i know it is last minute, but we decided to have a halloween party.
oh good! (and there is general excitement.)
and everybody has to wear costumes. (and there is general disconcertment.) come on! it will be fun!
well, I will-I will be there. i mean i have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…
please tell me you are not going to dress up like a dinosaur.
(exhales sarcastically) not two years in a row.
look, I will come to the party but I am not dressing up.
you have to!
no way! look, halloween is so stupid! dressing up, pretending to be someone you are not…
you are an actor!
so ross, are you going to bring mona?
yeah. yeah, i think i will.
that hot girl from their wedding?
yeah.
well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—ooh-ooh, leatherface from the texas chainsaw massacre—no-no-no! slutty leatherface.
now was not joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
that is right! he was hitting on her, and i got her. i guess the better man won. (to joey) please do not take her from me.
ursula! (ursula turns, smiles, and continues walking.) wait! err-err, it is me! phoebe!
wait a second! so, what is new with you?
what?!
huh. okay. well, I am really happy for you. (starts to walk away.)
really?
yeah. okay. umm, y’know, my friends are having a halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. maybe i could meet the guy you are marrying.
by the way, it is a costume party.
(looks down) no. but thanks. (walks away.)
hi!
wait! you are supposed to wear a costume!
i am! i am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she will not be able to fit into it.
oh.
ahh!
I am catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you are too big for it.
okay.
oh! oh! can i give out the candy? i really want to be with the kids right now. y’know, ever since i got pregnant i-i have the strongest maternal instincts.
(to them) just a minute!!! (she takes the candy and opens the door to two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) look at you guys! wow! you are a very scary witch. (gives her candy.)
and you are a very funny clown. (gives him candy.)
(to the cowgirl) and you are so in style right now. y’know, i work at ralph lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. i do not suppose you saw the cover of british vogue, but…
yeah. sure. (throws some in her bag and she walks away as phoebe, dressed as supergirl walks up and eyes monica who eyes her back.)
ah, catwoman. so we meet again.
so we do supergirl.
no, it is me. phoebe!
(entering from the bedroom wearing a big, pink bunny costume) monica! can i talk to you for a second? listen, i appreciate you getting me the costume…
(to monica) oh, you did this to him?
what?! i thought he would love it! his favorite kid's book was the velveteen rabbit!
the velveteen rabbit was brown and white!
well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
no bunny at all!! always no bunny at all!!!
(entering) hey!
you did not dress up either?!
yes i did! I am chandler. (looks at chandler) dude, what happened?
how is that me?
okay. I am chandler (makes a growling/gurgling sound at the end and the girls laugh.)
(to chandler) that is so you!
when have i ever done that?!
when have i ever done that?! (and does the sound again.)
oh! (opens the door to reveal a ballerina) well you are just the prettiest ballerina I have ever seen.
oh wow! that deserves another piece of candy.
well, i have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
ohh… oh, honey here. take it all. (pours the entire large bowl into her bag and closes the door.) monica! we need more candy?
what?! there is only been like four kids.
yeah i know, but one of them just said that she loved me so i just gave her everything.
no wonder your pregnant.
(entering) hey! (he is wearing a costume as well.)
hey.
what are you supposed to be?
remember the russian satellite, sputnik? (they all look at him.) well, I am a potato or a…spud. and these are my antennae. (points to the colander with an old tv antenna glued on top that he is wearing.) so sputnik, becomes… (they are still confused) spud-nik. spudnik!
wow! i do not have the worst costume anymore!
(sees ross) hey all right, ross came as doody.
no, i-I am not doody.
no, space doody!
okay, i will. but right after you tell me who the hell you are.
ursula’s fianc�e?
yeah.
yeah.
my mother killed herself.
no-no! that is okay, we will just start over. okay? hi! I am phoebe.
why are you looking at me like that?
okay. (hands him a napkin.) so, what are you?
(laughs) no i-i meant your costume.
i love the second grade!
yeah! it is so much better than first grade when you do not know what is going on and definitely better than third grade. y’know with all the politics and mind games.
umm, I am a masseuse…by day. (stands with her hands on her hips like a supergirl pose.)
no I am having fun. I am really—and I am really-really excited for you and ursula.
thank you.
hey joey?
yeah.
you read comic books right?
exclusively.
who do you think would win in a fight, catwoman or supergirl?
catwoman, hands down.
yeah…
but between you and phoebe, I would have to give the edge to phoebe.
what?! really?!
are you kiddin’? phoebe lived on the street. okay? plus, she is got this crazy temper. she—she is not standing right behind me is she?
no you are fine. (joey checks anyway.) all right well, do you think i could take rachel?
I am not sure.
what?! come on i am tough! punch me right here! (her stomach) as hard as you can!
will you relax?! what are you taking this so seriously for? it does not matter.
oh really? okay? well what would you say if i told you that, y’know, ross or chandler could beat you up?
i would say, "woman, please!"
(walking over) hey. ursula’s fianc�e is really sweet! he is a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. y’know normally y’know, i do not like really sweaty guys. but this one? i could just mop him up!
oh my god, phoebe!
what?
you are getting a crush on your sister’s fianc�e.
no I am not! you are!
(to monica) here comes the temper.
hi! y’know what honey, we are actually out of candy right now. but someone just went out to get some and i have been giving out money but I am out of that too. hey, can i write you a check?
okay, what is your name?
okay, I am just going to write this out to cash.
hey mona!
oh! hi!
joey’s going to be thrilled! he was hoping you would come by as a slutty nurse.
you would think that would embarrass me, but you see I am maxed out.
hey!
you made it!
well, I am a spud…
yes!
(to ross) marry her.
okay, here is a good one for ya. who do think would win in a fight between ross and chandler.
i can not answer that! chandler’s my husband.
so ross?
yeah.
hello handsome. (sees ursula over her shoulder) oh god. (walks away in shame as they kiss.) oh look at you two. so when did you guys meet?
two weeks? that is it?
oh really?
huh? (ursula motions for phoebe to keep quiet.)
peace corps, really? (ursula motions, "i do not know.")
how do you doody.
that is funny. yeah. y’know you are the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
oh relax man, relax. you are looking a little flushed.
(to monica) hey-hey-hey, i think we might find out the answer to our question.
what question?
monica and i were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or ross?
there is no question.
so you think ross too?
(to monica) you picked ross?!
ross is really strong! okay, he is the strongest out of all three of you! (joey looks at her.) except for joey.
i cannot believe you did not pick me.
uh, in her defense, she is right. i am stronger. i would destroy you.
oh really?! you think you are stronger? why do not you prove it? (he pushes ross who starts to fall backwards until mona catches him.)
oh I will prove it! I will prove it like a theorem!!
wait-wait!! okay, stop it! stop it! stop! (breaks it up.) now listen, no one’s going to fight in this apartment.
hey monica! (grabs her and pulls her into the living room.) people came to see a fight, let us give ‘them what they came for!
yeah. listen to the slutty nurse.
(to ross) you are going down.
oh yeah? you are going further down! downtown!
seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
oh gunther! you brought candy! thank you so much for picking this up! you are so sweet.
honey, someday you are going to make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
got to go! (opens the door to a boy in a cape.) hi! wow! there you go! (hands him some candy.)
oh yeah, we were but umm, now we have got candy.
well, that-that is not your choice. happy halloween!
well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and i got to give you free stuff?
you shut up!
uh, i think i just did. and uh-oh, here it comes again. shut up!
rach?
(to joey) yeah i know—I am good—i got it! (joey slowly backs away.) (to the boy) now wait a minute, I have got one more thing i have to say to you…oh right! shut up!
no! wait no! shut up—i mean do not cry! let me get my checkbook! (grabs her checkbook and runs after him.)
(to chandler) look honey, you do not have to do this, okay? it is the strength you have inside that means the most to me. you are loyal, you are honest, and you have integrity! that is the kind of strength that i want in the man that i love!
that means nothing to me. (to ross) come on!
hi liar!
y’know the only reason he is marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
but they are not!
why are you lying to him?
you too. and ursula?! it was really nice meeting you tonight!!
(entering) pheebs come on! bunny vs. doody! we are waiting! (they go inside.) (to chandler and ross.) okay. okay guys, one match, winner take all. (they grasp each other’s hand in preparation for battle.) oh wait-wait! what does the winner get?
pride.
and dignity.
(laughing) okay, if you say so. all right, ready? set! go!
or equally weak.
(to phoebe) oh god!
hmm?
chandler’s making his sex face.
(to chandler) so, you gettin’ tired?
nope! i can do this all day.
yeah? me too. (pause) gettin’ a little tired though.
god, I am exhausted.
look this is starting to look really bad for me. okay? mona, mona’s standing right over there. (looks behind him.) oh god, she is talking to joey! you got to let me win!
no way! if anything you have got to let me win! my wife thinks I am a wimp!
hey, at least you have a wife! i-i keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! and I am dressed as doody.
you are spudnik.
come on, who are we kidding? I am doody. please? she is watchin’.
fine. (he let us ross win.) oh no!
(celebrating) oh yeah!
(to her) you are a weird lady.
oh.
sure it does. yeah, yeah.
umm listen, i do not think…i do not think I am going to make it to the wedding. so i just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
okay i can not let you do this! she is lying to you.
she is lying! and i bet i can prove it. excuse me. (she grabs ursula’s purse and starts going through it and finds some papers.) okay. okay. yeah—not a prayer chain, but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan. (holds up her nametag.) okay, here is the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! not a teacher, a waitress. all right, here is her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. how old did she say she was?
oh, i almost do not want to show this. (hands it to him.) just remember I am a minute younger.
no. you are not, you are not stupid.
that is good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. just…you did it with the wrong person. (he looks at her.) what?
yeah, you should. (they shake hands.)
hey!
hey! well, i had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
that is not so bad.
no, i also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. oh, i am just awful with children!
come on! you are good with kids. they are just crazy on halloween. y’know, they are all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
really? you think that is all it is?
absolutely! halloween is the worst. except for christmas…and their birthdays. kind of get a little crazy during the summer too. and anytime they are hungry or sleepy. y’know, kids are tough. good luck with that. (walks away.)
look, i wanted to tell I am-I am sorry you lost.
listen, I have got a secret for ya. i let him win.
(laughs) is that a secret or a lie.
no, i let him win—ross!
yeah?
would you tell her i let you win please?
oh. yeah. (sarcastically) uh chandler let me win. no, chandler’s really strong. oh my arm is so sore. oh nurse! (waddles over to mona.)
i am strong! I will show you! (he sits down at the table.)
chandler please!
oh what is the matter? are you scared?
let us go big bunny!
okay. 1…2…3—go! (once again he is at a stalemate, but this time he is in pain.) (pause) I am going to kill myself!
what is going on?
well, my eye is a little itchy.
uhhh, mine too! yeah.
(to rachel) wow! it is really red! you should go see my eye doctor.
richard? I am not going to go see your ex-boyfriend!
oh, richard. that is all i ever hear, richard, richard, richard!
since we have been going out, i think I have mentioned his name twice!
okay, so richard, richard!
it is not richard! okay? it is this new guy and he is really good.
well, I am sorry I am not going to an eye doctor!
oh god, here we go!
what?
anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. watch! watch! (he takes his finger and moves it towards his eye.)
(flinches) ross! come on! that is all right! fine--okay, i have a weird thing about my eye. can we not talk about it please?
hey rach, remember that great song, me, myself, and i? (and on the "i" part she mimics poking her eye.)
(flinches again) monica! come on!
hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? all those in favor say i? (pokes his eye)
(freaks) ross! stop it! come on!
how much did i love the king and i? (oh, you get the point by now.)

all right, i got to go. I am taking ben to the park.
ohh, give him a kiss for me!
all right, bye!

(after he is gone) i am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. i did not mean to be so out there. i am furious with him!
wow umm, calm down.
I am trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!
why are so mad at him?
look, i do not want to talk about it. okay?
well, it just seems that…
you want to be on my list too? keep talking! has anyone seem my list by the way?
uh, no pheebs. what is it look like?
uh, it is a piece of paper and it says, "ross" on it.
(entering, depressed) hey. i just got off the phone with estelle and guess what. (pause, then very excitedly) i got the lead in a movie!!!!!!
you got the lead in a movie? that is amazing! what is the movie about?!
it is called shutter speed, it is really cool! yeah, umm, i meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? and then, she disappears… but i find out where she lives and when i get there this like old lady answers the door and i say, "where is betsy?" right? and she says, "betsy's been dead for 10 years."
ohh-oh, chilling!
and the best part is, we are filming in the desert outside vegas! (to chandler) and you know what that means buddy!
yeah, i know that means buddy!
road trip! yeah, we can rent a car! i just have to be there by tuesday!
oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
well, uh, we can talk about that too pheebs.
no! no, her cab! she probably will not be using it; you can drive it to las vegas.
all right! thanks pheebs!
whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
oh umm, not go.
all right, great, road trip baby! (to monica) this okay with you?
chandler! you do not have to ask for my permission. (quietly) you can go.
thank you.
hey rach, come on! we are going to be late for the eye doctor appointment!
(entering from her bedroom) all right! let us get this over with! ugh! (she walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) ohhh! no! look what i did! (she starts walking through the mess. {also, notice the continuity error in this scene. note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) oh, i mean, look at this mess! i mean, we are probably going to have to clean this up! y'know? we are going to have to reschedule!
no. if you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! all right, let us go blinky! (she ushers rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) chandler!!!! (chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)
oh hey joey! what is up?
i can not decide which route to take to vegas. hey, you have traveled a lot right?
yeah, I have been around.
okay, so-so which route should i take the northern route or the southern route?
ooh, if you take the northern route there is a man in illinois with a beard of bees. {okay, i must protest this, I have lived in illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
great! problem solved!
but on the southern route there is a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
well, back to square one.
oh, i know a way that you can decide! all right, I am going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
(quickly) yes!
good, but wait. okay, all right, here we go. now i want you to relax. take a deep breath. clear your mind. (quickly) which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
peanut butter!
which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
a swimmer!
who would you rather sleep with monica or rachel?
monica. oh… huh, i always thought it would be rachel.
no thinking! no thinking! tie or ascot?
ascot!
north route or south route?
north route!
bamn! there you go! huh?
wow! that was incredible! beard of bees, here i come!
(entering) hey!
oh, this guy again. (she ignores him.)
hey man, what is up?
uhh, not much. you guys want to see a movie tonight?
sure, what do you want to see?
i do not know, umm…
oh, i know how we can decide. phoebe, show him your game!
umm, no thank you. (she gets up and moves to the couch. they were at a table previously.)
what is with her?
i do not know. but hey, i know we can decide. okay, I am going to ask you questions and you answer real quick. okay?
okay.
what do you like better action or comedy?
action.
who would you rather sleep with monica or rachel?
dude, you are sick.
oh, I am sorry. i forgot you had that whole rachel thing.
oh my god! what does that thing do?
(looks at it more closely) oh that is an eye removal machine.
all right, I am outta here!
I am kidding! I am kidding!
hey!

okay.
uh-huh.
okay.
(jerks back from the tester) what?!
a small puff of air, now come on!
all right.
I am sorry. all right, I will just stay in here this time. (puts her head back.) okay.
uh-huh.
y'know what, I am going to hold her head.
okay.
okay. (monica backs off.)
okay. okay!
(really excited) great!! it was very, very nice to meet you sir--ow! hey! what are you doing?! are you crazy! (he took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)
yeah, no, i do not-i do not put things in my eye.
great!
okay, just give me the damn drops! (grabs them and storms out.)
dr. miller? (she covers her right eye and reads from the chart) p e c f d.
i sure do! (she runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (to rachel) and you do not get one!
y'know, i-i got to tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. my eye is a 100% better.
they are still in my coat.
damn!
(entering) hey!
hey! you ready to go?
yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? do i need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
what?
i love you.
man, i wish ross was coming with us! y'know? I am going to miss him!
thanks a lot! i just got that jerk out of my mind!
hey, so where are we staying? is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
uh no, not really. it is an independent film y'know? so we do not have a real big budget. i figured I would just stay in your room.
i see, but once you get your first paycheck you will be springing a big hotel suite, right? i mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
oh yeah! for every dollar shutter speed makes, one penny of it goes right in joey's pocket.
so you do not get paid unless the movie makes money?
did you not hear the plot of the movie? "she is been dead for ten years." I am going to be a millionaire!
(entering) hey!
hey!
i just want to say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? twenty bucks on black 15.
you got it!
all right!
all right, bye-bye now!
bye!
bye you guys!
bye-bye!
i want to say good-bye at the car!
okay!
anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
oh honey, I will say good-bye to you at the car if you do not mind the puss.
see ya! (walks out.)
well, wait a minute! the puss is good! it means it is healing! (runs after him.)
hey pheebs, what 'cha reading? (phoebe ignores him) pheebs? (turns away) hello? (he sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) phoebe? (he moves closer and she keeps moving away.) phoe-phoebe! (they end up hanging over the arm rest.) come on! (he grabs the magazine away from her.)
oh, I am sorry. i did not see you there.
phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? because if are please, tell me what it is i did!
well, if you do not know i can not help you.
well, i do not know.
well, i can not help you.
well, whatever it is I am-I am very, very sorry. okay?
apology accepted.
okay. so we are, we are good?
uh-huh.

(quietly) bye, fat ass.
all right!! phoebe now come on! will you please tell me what it is i did that mad you so mad at me!
i do not know! i do not remember!
well if you can not remember, can not we just forget about this?
oh no, i am mad at you. i know that much. but, i am sorry about the fat ass thing. you actually have a very sweet little hiney.
man, I am getting pretty tired. you are might have to take over soon.
we have been driving for a half-hour, and you have not looked at the road once.
do not worry, it is out there! (just then a horn honks and joey quickly looks at the road.) i think i just need lunch.
yeah.
you want to eat? (pulls out the twenty) my treat!
is not that ross's money?
yeah. okay. ross's treat! where do you want to eat?
i do not know.
ooh, hey, i know how we can decide! all right, uh, I am going to ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. okay? so uh, clear your mind clear it right out! clear it out! clear!
okay!
okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
too dry.
do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
no!
is this movie going to be my big break?
no!
(shocked) what?!
yes.
dude you said, "no!"
i also said, "yes!"
you do not think this is going to be a big break for me?
no! (realizes) ahhh!!!
i do not believe this!
look joe, i just, i just do not want to get your hopes up real high.
what are you talking about?! I am the lead in a movie!
they are not even paying ya! this does not even sound like a real movie!
y'know what? i do not need this! okay? i do not know why you are dumping all over my big break.
joe, i do not think this is going to be your big break.
is that why you are on this trip, huh? make me feel like a loser? because if it is, I will tell ya, i-i-I would rather be alone.
oh, you do not want me on the trip?
not if you are going to be like this!
all right, I will tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I will lie.
yeah! i do not want you on the trip!
all right, fine! fine! why do not you pull over? I will get out right now!
fine! (he slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) get out!
you are not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
get out!!
all right!! (gets out and joey speeds away.) wait! wait, there is no sidewalk! yeah, I am going to die here.
okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
no.
are you angry at me because i said your handwriting is childlike?
no that made me feel precious.
oh, i know! umm, is it because he is always correcting people's grammar? whom! whom! sometimes it is who!
yeah? sometimes it is… (does the fist thing.)
oh, did you beat him at a board game? he turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
okay, I am the baby. (points at his eye.)
eh! stop it!
(entering) hey!
chandler! what are you doing here?
hey!
joey kicked me out of the car on the george washington bridge!
i do not know! he went crazy! y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
that game should not be played without my supervision.
well, i do not know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, i did not think this was not going to be his big break, that this movie was not going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it did not sound like a real movie--okay, he should have pushed me off of the bridge.
what is in the bag?
oh, i figured you guys would all be mad at me. so i got you some gifts that i found on the side of the road. (looks into the bag.) who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
i do!
okay. (she tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. the only problem is, it is not over her eye.)
not even close.
okay, then y'know what? help me! i need help! i can not do this!
okay! all right! let us do it!
all right!
sit down. (they sit down on the couch.)
all right.
put your head back.
yes!
all right.
okay.
now, open your eyes.
okay, they are. (no they are not.)
how many fingers am i holding up? (she is not holding any up.)
(thinks) four.
oh my god, i was thinking four.
really?!
yes! all right, y'know what? why do not we start with a practice run? okay?
okay!
no drops!
great!
okay.
okay.
on three, 1…2…3! (rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.) now my pillow's all wet! (she was trying to fool rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.)
well, well, you said it was practice!
then why did you move?!
because i knew you were lying!
all right, come here! (she gets up and drags rachel off of the couch by her legs.)
(as she is being dragged) what are you? monica!! stop it!! oh my god! stop it! (monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)
i am going… I am going--turn it over! (rachel rolled onto her stomach and monica rolls her back.) I am… i am going to get these drops in your eyes. (she is holding rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)
oh my god! you really are freakishly strong!
monica! stop it!
(spitting out the eyedropper) damn! it is empty!
wow, y'know if joey and chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (monica is straddling rachel and holding her arms down. in a rather risqu� pose, at least for primetime tv.)
ooh that is definitely chandler, joey, or ross. (thinks) or-or rachel!
(answers the phone) hello? (listens.) (to phoebe) it is joey. (phoebe's proud of herself.) (to joey) I am so glad you called! chandler told me what happened. y'know he is really upset about it.
(on a pay phone holding a box) not as upset as he is going to be when he finds out what i did with his sweater vests!
what did you do to his sweater vests?
let us just say there is a well-dressed pack of dogs in ohio. hey monica listen is-is phoebe there? i got to ask her something about the car.
yeah, she is here. hold on a second. (she hands the phone to phoebe.)
hey, dude!
hey pheebs! listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. what-what is it?
oh that is my grandma. (joey holds the box away from him.) and thanks joey she is having a really great time. (joey is happy now.)
(who has just entered) is that joey? is that joey? let me talk to him! i want to talk to him!
okay joey? chandler's here, he was wondering… (we hear the dial tone as joey hangs up.) okay, i guess he ran out of change.
y'know, he will not even talk to me. how am i going to apologize to him if he will not even talk to me?
well, maybe you should send him something. so that when he gets to las vegas he will know that you are sorry.
that is a good idea. i wonder where i could (pause) get a basket of porn…
no, do not-do not say I am sorry with porn!
really?
y'know what you should send him? a cartoon of cigarettes. because that why he could trade it for protection. no. that is prison.
(entering) okay pheebs, i know how we are going to figure this out. okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. okay?
uh-hmm.
what do you like better flora or fauna?
fauna.
who would you rather be simon or garfunkle?
garfunkle.
why are you mad at me?
you said i was boring--ohh!
when did i say you were boring?!
oh my god, i remember now! we were playing chess!
phoebe! you and i have never played chess!
oh, come on! yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? we were playing chess, you said i was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were cameron diaz! (realizes) okay, there is a chance this may have been a dream.
hey-hey! stanley! hey-hey! you are leading man is here! let us get to work.
wh-what?! why?!
(laughs) you are kidding right?
what?!
uh, hang out?! how long?
no!
yeah.
thanks. (the grip walks away.) (reading the card.) congratulations on your big break.
(answering it) hello?
(on phone from vegas) hey monica, it is joey!
hey joey! aww, you remembered even though you are a big star!
aw, come on! it will be years before i forget you!
joey, what is it like on a movie set, huh? do you have a dressing room? do you have a chair with your name on it?
uh, well yeah-yeah, I have got all of that going on. yeah, listen uh, i want you to make sure you tell chandler that he could not have been more wrong! uh-oh! i got to go monica, my uh, my sushi's here!
(to the family) sorry about that. thanks for waitin'.
everybody smile! (the picture is taken) okay, thanks a lot! enjoy your stay at caesar's! we hope it is toga-rrific! (the family leaves.) kill me. kill me now.
hey rach, can you pass me the tv guide?
yep!
go!!
what?!! stop it! stop it! oh my god!
okay! okay! okay! (she succeeds in getting the eye drops in and everyone climbs off of rachel.) we will see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
oh! (she is trying to recover while still on the floor.)
you are welcome for a delicious dinner.
hey what are you guys looking at?
ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
yeah, come to papa.
i know!
probably the only time I will ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
where did you, when did you, how did you... (joey hits the back of chandler's head) how did you get a girl like that?
yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
actually she is a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
okay, but that is, like, the easiest era.
I have seen her at work, but i always figured, ah-huh? but, uh, i made her dinner. we had a great time. and we are going out again tomorrow.
well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
fine by me; hope she wins.
hi. you guys have any wrapping paper?
oo! is it for my birthday present?
phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just has not come yet?
well, i have a call in about that.
'kay.
actually, this is for kathy's birthday. it is an early edition of her favorite book.
oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
okay, but do not touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
huh. well, then you would better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that?
oh, it was not a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
oh, honey, that is so sweet.
yeah, and what a great way to say, "i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
it does not say that. does it?
how do you think it is going to look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange?
okay, all right, I will just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great.
it is got to be better than that book. oo! like a crossbow!
(entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) yeah, once again, i am sorry. thank you. bye. (to the gang) i just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
oh my god! what happened?
sixty guests.
so, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
because i do not have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. i mean there is no way.
wow, what is with all the negativity? you sound like monican't , not monican... (monica looks almost puzzled) ...monica. look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. do you want to be a caterer or not?
i do not know.
there you go, that is the spirit! okay! now, if you need money, i will lend you money, but just get moving!
really? because I would need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
okay! it is worth it, if it will get you moving. you have not worked in months.
well, you are not working either.
yes, but I am doing this.
yeah, that would be great! thank you!
hey!
why?
you can pee here!
it is okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (kathy goes into the bathroom.) hey joe! what are you getting kathy for her birthday?
we have only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think i got to get her something?
yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
oh, i know...
and not one of your coupons for an hour of "joey love."
ooo, a crossword! can i help?
no! I am sorry, honey, it is just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help.
fine. but you can not help me develop my new universal language.
hey!
hey, how did it go?
oh my god, it was the best funeral ever! i mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? i even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. i mean, it is like i am the official caterer for that accident!
mon! I am so happy for you!
thanks. like, check out my new catering stuff. (picks up two frying pans) look at this! I am an omelet station! omelet? made to order!
I will have one, please. plus my money.
oh. well, i did not realize that you needed it back right away. i mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. so i went. i beed. i mean, i... i used it to buy all this stuff. but look—I have got another job tomorrow, so I will pay you back with the money i make from that.
oh. okay. oo, sorry i acted like a bank.
okay.
(moved by the kiss) huh...
did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
mitzi is.....
(mouths "where?") uh... oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage and falters) ...do you have any, um, cinnamon fruit toasties?
well, i do! why do not we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of cinnamon fruit toasties, uh...
oh, yeah, why not?
oh, is everything in the car?
yes. did you settle the bill?
no. i hate this part.
oh, look what we almost left. (picks up a coffee maker)
no, that is not mine.
oh, all right. oh! look what we almost took!
excuse me, mrs. burkart? well, we are all cleaned up in the kitchen.
um, and, well there is the.. the the small matter of...
just the matter of ...payment?
you know what we should all do? go see a musical.
(confused) sure...
and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one?
i do not know... um, grease?
no....
rent?
yes! rent!
okay, so when do you want to go?
what? oh, I am sorry, i can not, I am busy.
(entering the apartment) hey. man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
yes, it is, at office max.
what did you get her? (joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)
a pen.
it is two gifts in one. it is a pen that is also a clock! huh?
huh-huh! you can not give her that.
why not?
because she is not eleven! and it is not the seventh night of hanukkah!
okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it is just not something a boyfriend gives?
sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she is writing, she turns it over.... "whoa! it is time for my date with joey!"
all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday?
she did not have a birthday while we were going out.
for three years?
(whining and heading toward the door) look, it is too late, and i got an audition. i can not shop anymore! i...
all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay?
thanks, man. and oh, while you are at it, could you get her a card?
would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
but mon, you have to get our money!
oh, phoebe, she could not stop crying! with those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
i know, it is tough. you know what the first thing i did after my mother's funeral was?
what?
pay the caterer! look, I have had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. it is either, you know, "that massage was not long enough, or, "i do not recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros are not big enough. bad little white girl!"
okay. so what do you.... you think she is faking?
well, it seems like there were not any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
she seems fine now.
so, you just left? her place was really that bad?
you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
yeah.
well, like that, only instead of a chair, it is a pile of garbage. and instead of a jacket, it is a pile of garbage. and instead of the end of the day, it is the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to joey who puts it on.) here.
wow. thanks. so, uh, what happened?
what do you mean? nothing happened! i had to get out of there.
all right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
no, i tried that. she says it has a weird smell.
what kind of smell?
i do not know. soap?
all right, listen, ross... you like this girl, right?
yeah.
you want to see her again, right?
yeah.
so you are going to have to do it in the mess!
yeah, okay you are right.
yeah.
i mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
yeah!
it is, uh... it is endearing, really.
all right! now you go get that beautiful pig! (ross hesitates, looks unsure) oink!
okay, all right. i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
any luck?
oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called "invisible things for kathy." (motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
all right, look. why do not you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen.
she is really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i do not get to be the one who gives it to her.
aw, honey, that is so sweet.
yeah? you do not think it is just pathetic?
oh! pathetic! (grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)
(entering) hey! I am meeting kathy in ten minutes! I have been looking all over for you!
where?
our place, the hall! i...
i got something for her. (joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can not hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) it is a book!
(unimpressed) a book? (suddenly interested) is it like a book that is also a safe?
no, it is a book that is just a book, okay? it is an early edition of the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
you got it. thanks man. thanks for doing this, i owe you one. (joey leaves, comes back in.) oh, hey! there was not any change from that twenty, was there?
no, it came out to an even twenty.
wow. that is almost as much as a new book.
you did not get the money, did you?
maybe i can try at intermission? phoebe, come on... you know what? let us just go!
no! hey, we are not leaving until we get paid! i do not know who she thinks she is! enough is enough! (phoebe goes into the living room.) hey, widow?
okay, widow!
excuse me. excuse me! (mrs. bukart stops singing) thanks. um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we are paid every penny. because you know what, lady? we are part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
good. (phoebe and mrs. burkart go into the other room, leaving monica with everyone staring at her.)
I am going to leave some cards here. please think of us for you next event.
(mustering up courage) yes. yes i do. (they go inside.)
department of sanitation?
oh! (she kisses him) ah. (they kiss more, and move down onto the couch. ross's hand moves under some garbage) aw! (his hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)
(trying to make his disgust into lust) ah, cheryl!
oh my god! I am so sorry, cheryl. i must have freaked out.
i did it! oh! i finished it! i did it all by myself! and there is nobody to hug!
hey! hey, you guys, i finished the crossword all by myself! hug me!
uh... yay!
thanks!
oh, that is great! congratulations!
thank you! hey, how did the catering go?
oh, it was great! the widow would not pay, so phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
yeah. I am a hard ass.
and I am a wuss. and we should be partners.
yeah. hard ass and wuss. we could fight crime!
wait a minute, phoebe! we should be partners. we should be catering partners. i mean, think about it! you are not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
okay!
i can cook and you can take care of the money.
yeah. oh! it will be like i have a wife in the fifties!
hey!
hey, how did it go? how did she like the gift?
oh, man, she loved it! she is over there showing monica and rachel right now.
oh yeah? that is great!
hey, listen, i got to tell ya, i feel kind of bad taking credit for this, because man, am i going to get a lot of credit for this!
[nodding, with mixed feelings] aahhuuhhh....
hey!
hey! happy birthday.
you know, uh... [joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] chandler got you a gift, too.
no he did not. [moving it back.]
yeah, he did, look... look, it is right there on the counter! ha-ho-ho!
happy birthday! I am sorry.
see, you think it is just a pen, but then you turn it over and it is also a clock.
oh, yeah... yeah.
ah. hm. (to kathy) want to go to bed?
oh, uh... do not forget your coupon. (tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. then goes inside).
[to kathy] goodnight.
oh, uh, yeah... i just knew that sometimes when you are writing, you... you do not always know the exact time.
uh, the book?
what do you mean?
(tongue-tied) uhl..ell. by the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "uhl, ell."
oh, yeah, he is my... he is my best friend.
goodnight. (goes to his room.)
(opening bedroom door) hey, that coupon expires, you know.
hi. uh, you... you do not know me, I am monica geller... ross's sister.
yeah. anyway, he told me about your apartment. and, um, i could not sleep, thinking about it. so, uh, would it be okay if i cleaned it?
no?
i can not believe you would actually say that. i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty.
no way! mr.salty is a sailor, all right, he is got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
i do not know, you do not want to mess with corn nuts. they are craaazy.
(looking out of the window) oh my god. you guys! you got to come see this! there is some creep out there with a telescope!
i can not believe it! he is looking right at us!
oh, that is so sick.
i feel violated. and not in a good way.
how can people do that?... (all but phoebe walk away from the window in disgust.) oh, you guys, look! ugly naked guy got gravity boots!
i am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. it was unbelievable! we could totally be ourselves, we did not have to play any games...
so have you called her yet?
let her know i like her? what are you, insane? (the girls make disgusted noises.) it is the next day! how needy do i want to seem? (to the guys) I am right, right?
i can not believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
oh, god, just do it! (grabbing the phone.) call her! stop being so testosteroney!
which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat. (calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) i got her machine.
her answer machine?
no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
so, uh, why did not you say anything?
oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase "yes indeedy-of."
look look! it is rachel and barry. no, do not everybody look at once!
okay, okay, what is going on?
okay, they are just talking...
yeah, well, does he look upset? does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
no, no actually, he is smiling.. and... oh my god, do not do that!!
what? what? what?!
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (rachel enters.) oh!
(bluffing) and basically, that is how a bill becomes a law.
hey rach!
how did it go?
y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. he took me to lunch at the russian tea room, and i had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
not a good day for birds...
then we took a walk down to bendall's, and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel...
that is nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? it was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
that is, that is nice twice!
rachel, what is going on? i mean is not this the same barry who you left at the altar?
duh, where have you been?
yeah, but it was different with him today! and he was not, like, orthodontist guy, y'know? i mean, we had fun! is there anything wrong with that?
yes!
why?
i have my reasons.
okay, how about the fact that he is engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
all right. all right, all right, all right, all right, i know it is stupid! i will go see him this afternoon, and i will just put an end to it!
wow... wow!
I am not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that.
ooh, and it is so nice having this little sink here...
(on phone, reading from a script) oh, danielle! i was not expecting the machine... give me a call when you get a chance. (rattles some dishes) bye-bye. (hangs up.) oh god!
that is what you have been working on for the past two hours?!
hey, I have been honing!
what was with the dishes?
oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like i have not been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
(looking out the window) look look! he is doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
oh my god! (walks to the window) go away! (gesturing.) stop looking in here!
great, now he is waving back.
man, we got to do something about that guy. this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment. it creeps me out! i feel like i can not do stuff!
what kind of stuff?
will you grow up? I am not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I am cooking naked.
you cook naked?
yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
what are you looking at me for? i did not know that.
oh, it is just... oh, barry, this was not good.
well, what about mindy?
no, not that, i mean, what about you and mindy?
no. no-no-no-no, no. i mean, do not do that. not, i mean not for me.
oh, barry..! come on, this is all way too..
i had a bra.
what?!
can i use your phone?
yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
yes, it is working! why is not she calling me back?
maybe she never got your message.
y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably did not get her messages yet.
y'do not think that makes me seem a little...
...desperate, needy, pathetic?
ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
how many beeps?
she answered.
y'see, this is where you would use that 'hello' word we talked about.
I am not going to talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now I am needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy.
how did he take it?
pretty well, actually... (wandering into the kitchen.)
(wandering in after her) uh, rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
oh, do i?
uh huh.
(in a low voice) we ended up having sex in his chair.
you had sex in his chair?!... i said that a little too loudly, did not i?
you-you had what?
sex in his chair.
what, uh... what were you thinking?
i do not know! i mean, we still care about each other. there is a history there. 's'like you and carol.
no! no no, it is nothing like me and carol!
please. if she said to you, "ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
if it helps, i could slide over.
it is, it is, it is, uh, a totally diferent situation! it is, it is apples and oranges, it is, it is orthodontists and lesbi- i got to go.
where are you going?
(leaving) i just have to go, all right? do i need a reason? huh? i mean i have things to do with my life, i have a jam packed schedule, and i am late- for keeping up with it. okay?
hello? hello?
(on phone) hello?(listens) mindy! hi! hey, how are you? (listens) yes, yes, I have heard, congratulations, that is so great. (listens) really? (listens) oh. (listens) okay. okay, well I am working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... (listens) okay... (listens) great... (listens) great... (listens) all right, so I will, so I will see you tomorrow! (listens) okay.. (listens) okay... (listens) bye. (hangs up and sits down heavily.) oh god. oh god. oh god.
so how is mindy?
oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...oh, she sounded really weird, i got to call barry... (does so, on phone) hi, it is me, i just.. mindy!! mindy! hi! no, i figured that is where you would be!
brrrrrrr!
hell is filled with people like you.
(entering) he is back! the peeper's back!
(ducking) get down!
get down?
...and boogie!
thanks, but i got to go to work and get my eyes scratched out by mindy.
relax. y'know, she may not even know.
please. i have not heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? i mean, what else is it about? oh! she was my best friend, you guys! we went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
(intrigued) yeah?
and now, y'know, I am like... I am like the other woman! i feel so..
..naughty!
right, I will see you guys later...
oh, hold up, I will walk out with you. now, rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kind of little uniform, or- (rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) that is fine, yeah...
okay, I am going to go to the bathroom. will you watch my phone?
why do not you just take it with you?
hey, we have not been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
why do not you just call her?
i can not call her, i left a message! i have some pride.
do you?
no! (calls) danielle, hi! it is, uh, it is chandler! (listens) I am fine. uh, listen, i do not know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that i am, i accidentally shut off my phone. (listens) oh, uh, okay, that is fine, that is great. (listens) okay. (puts down the phone.) (to monica) she is on the other line, she is going to call me back. (he starts doing a little jig.) she is on the other line, she is going to call me back, she is on the other line, going to call me back...
do not you have to pee?
's'why I am dancing...
mindy.
hey, you.... so, what is up?
sure we should... so.
okay.
of course!
was that all you wanted to ask me?
ohhhh!! (mindy starts to sob.) ...what? what?
oh sure it is!
um, what- what would make you think that?
(draws back) really. mindy, if it will make you feel any better, when i was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
what? what is what you were afraid of?
what?
uh... oh, mindy, you are so stupid. oh, we are both so stupid.
(offers her arm to mindy and she sniffs) smell familiar?
oh, i am so sorry.
(watches them for a while) oh my.
four letters: "circle or hoop".
ring dammit, ring!
thanks.
(entering) hey, you know our phone's not working?
what?!
i tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
(investigating) i turned it off. mother of god, i turned it off!
just like you told her you did! (chandler glares at her.) ... just pointing out the irony.
hey, so listen, i went across the street and talked to the doorman- i got the peeper's name! can i use the phone?
nngghhh!!!!!!!
(to monica) can i use your phone? (on phone) yeah, the number for a sidney marks, please.
"heating device."
radiator.
five letters.
rdtor.
(on phone) yeah, is sidney there? (listens) oh, this is? (to the gang) sidney's a woman.
so she is a woman! so what?
yeah. yeah, so what? (on phone) look, i live across the street, (walking to the window) and i know all about you and your little telescope, and i do not appreciate it, okay? (listens) yeah, i can see you right now! (listens) hello! (listens) if i want to walk around my apartment in my underwear, i should not have to feel like—(listens)—thank you, but... that is not really the point... (listens) the point is that... (listens) mostly free weights, but occasionally..
joey!!
(on phone) yeah, my neighbor... (listens) yeah, the brunette... (to monica) she says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
the green dress? really?
yeah, she said you looked like ingrid bergman that day.
(waves dismissively to sidney) nooo!
hey. got a second?
uh, we are here to break up with you.
uh- which one of us are you talking to there, barr?
even when we were having sex in that chair?
please! during that second time you could not have picked her out of a lineup!
well, the first time did not really count... i mean, y'know, 's'barry.
okay. okay, we will be here! hating you! did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? listen honey, if I am hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I am telling you, this feels great.
what are you talking about?! mindy, the guy is the devil! he is satan in a smock!
oh god.
and i hope barry does not kill you and eat you in aruba.
you okay?
yeah.
really?
yeah! y'know, ever since i ran out on barry at the wedding, i have wondered whether i made the right choice. and now i know.
aww... (they hug)
big day.
all right, I will give you this, mr. peanut is a better dresser. i mean he is got the monocle, he is got the top hat...
you know he is gay?
i just want to clarify this: are you outing mr. peanut?
danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody.
what are you doing here?
...I am, I am okay.
that sounds good. I will call you- or you call me, whatever...
okay.
whoo-hoo!
yeah, there you go!

...i dunno.
you do not know?!
well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if i was okay? i mean,... how needy is that?
(to joey) oh hey! how was your audition?
I am sorry, do i know you?
what are you doing?
nothing, I am just practicing blowing you off because I am going to be a big movie star!
oh! you got it?!
well, no not yet. but the audition went really good.
what was it for?
oh, it is this big budget period movie about these three italian brothers who come to america around the turn of the century. it is really classy! oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next martin scorcese.
the next, next?
yeah, there is this guy from chicago who is supposed to be the next martin scorcese, all right? but then this guy’s right after him. (joey’s cell phone rings and he answers it.) hello!
(to monica and phoebe) they loved me!
(on phone) oh my god!
are you kidding me? i never rent a movie without it! (listens) oh. (listens) uh, okay uh let me call you back. (hangs up.)
what is the matter?
they want me to be totally naked in the movie!
wow!
i know! my grandmother’s going to see this!
grandma’s going to have to get in line.
hey the wedding is so close! are you getting nervous?
yeah. but a part of me also can not wait ‘til it is over. chandler and i have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
a no sex pact huh? i actually have one of those going on with every woman in america.
hey phoebe, will you give me a hand?
sure.
i got to make up the guest bedroom. (to ross) hey, cousin cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
cassie?
uh-hmm.
wow, i have not seen her for like forever. i wonder if she still carries that barbie everywhere she goes.
ross, she is 25 years old.
so what! i still have—no you are probably right.
(entering) hi!
hey!
hey!
hey pheebs, can i talk to you over here for a second?
yeah!
subtle guys!
what?!
i know you are planning my surprise bridal shower.
(laughs) well okay—well do not ruin it! just play along at least!
okay. sorry. (she goes into the guest bedroom.)
(to phoebe) oh my god! we have to throw her a shower?!
hey! what did you decide to do about the movie?
i do not know! it is not like it is porn! this is a serious, legitimate movie. y’know? and the nudity is really important to the story.
that is what you say about porn.
you are right. maybe i should not even go on the call back.
no! no you should! a lot of major actors do nude scenes! i mean the chance to star in a movie? come on!
well that is true. and i am only naked in one scene. plus it sounds really great. my character’s catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl. who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. it is really sweet and-and tender.
plus, everyone is going to see your thing. (giggles.)
well when can we have this shower?
she has got so much going on we-we have only two options. we have friday…
well that is only two days away. what is the other option?
yesterday!
well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! we are done!
oh my god phoebe, this is impossible! we can not do this by friday! we have to find a place. we have to invite people! we have to get food! there is just too much to do! it is impossible! we can not do it! we cannot do it! we cannot do it!
rachel, calm down!
(calmly) okay. I am sorry. you are right, you are right.
(grabs and shakes rachel) just calm down woman!
phoebe, i already, i already did.
oh okay. all right, then i need to calm down a little.
okay. okay. (they sit down.) i think we can do this if we just get organized. all right? we have two days to plan this party. we just need to make fast decisions! okay? all right, where are we going to have it?
uh, here. what time?
4 of the clock. food?
finger sandwiches and tea.
ooh great! very monica.
and chili!
ah you went one too far. uh, flowers or balloons?
both!
we are paying for this y’know.
neither.
okay. umm, what should we do for the theme?
lusts of the flesh.
(pause) what?
i do not know. (timidly) a cowboy theme?
hey!
hey!
y’know I am-I am really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
oh boy me too!
y’know i was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
yeah?
technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering?!
the wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
that is me! come on!
okay. (they both jump up to head for there room, but monica stops.) but wait, we can not. my cousin cassie is in the guest room, we are supposed to have lunch.
well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
shrill?! the wedding is back on!
(transfixed) hi! nice to meet you!
so, are you ready to go?
(catching him) chandler!
I will be right with you.
(to ross) cassie needs to stay at your place.
what—why?
because purvry perverson over here can not stop staring at her.
what?! chandler she is our cousin!
i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. it is called being a good conversationalist. watch. (stares at monica’s eyes.) say something.
you were staring about eight inches south of there.
fine, she can stay at my place. by the way, what-what does cassie even look like now.
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn.
umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
wafer thin ice!
hey, I am back!
uh so, will-will i be reading the same scene again?
oh great! y’know i would have been perfect for this part, but whatever! y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! good day! (starts to leave.)
and scene! huh? was not that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah! okay! so you-you-you-you were saying?
wow! sure! that is great!
yeah! yeah sure, just long as it is handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
so…what?
yes!
no. what?
barmifsaed?
so to get this part you can not be?
nope.
but you are?
yep.
but you told them you were not?
that is right.
wow! wow! and it is definitely all gone? there is nothing there to work with? (joey glares at her.) what were you thinking?
i do not know! i really want this part! and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘them you can! and just figure out how to do it later.
joey! this is not like learning to ride a horse! this is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!
i kn-i know! i know! okay? and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
oh my god, what are you going to do?!
i just have to call my agent and tell her i can not do the part. (gets up for the phone.)
unless!
unless what?
well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
like what?
well I am not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I am thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
hey! I have got a great idea for party favors for the shower. okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone is names in them and inside is everyone is individual birth stone.
okay. okay. all right, you take care of that. and meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still do not have a guest list.
okay. okay! well okay, who do we know that is coming? me. are you?
(entering) hey!
hey!
hey! what is up mon?
well uh, I am trying to make something for joey. do you mind if i raid your fridge?
have at it.
okay. (opens the fridge.) all right, turkey. eh, that will not work. cheese? (picks it up) that will not work. olive loaf? (picks it up) i hope that will not work.
are you makin’ him a sandwich?
no it is umm, more like a wrap. okay so uh, I am going to go guys.
i guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! (runs out.)
(to phoebe, after monica’s gone) we have to get her a present?!
okay but look! look at what i got! it is her address book! (holds it up.) we have a guest list!
oh my god you are amazing! did you just pull that out of her purse?
uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (holds up $40.)
(shocked at her beauty) cassie?!
hey!
oh. oh, that is right. so-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you did not.
it is okay. come, come on in.
oh.
uh-huh. yeah i-i have a knack for impressions.
yeah—no!!
cassie, how you-how you doing on that…hot dog.
(quietly) thank god.
oh right. right. ooh, remember the time i uh, i pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried? (she laughs) we are probably too old to do that now.
(looking then moving away quickly) uh-huh! uh-huh! and-and-and I will always remember that summer because that is when i realized that we are related.
well I am, I am a little slow. (to himself) just as our children would be.
hi!
how are you? (the woman nods) good. (she goes over to another couple of women.) hi, thanks for coming.
thank you. (to the other woman) no? (she nods.) all right. (she goes to another pairing.) oh, it is so nice to see you.
okay. (goes over to rachel.) hey rach?
yeah?
who the hell are all these people?
well, i do not know. i called all the people in monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
hmm, y’know there is another word for people like that. losers!
(to her) hi! I am rachel. this is phoebe. I am the maid of honor. how do you know monica?
ohhhh!
that is great!
(to the woman) excuse us for a minute. (they go into the kitchen.) you did not tell her to come?!
you were supposed to tell her!
no i was not! you were supposed to tell her to come and i was supposed to bring the cake!
fine, I will go call her.
yes! and please tell her to bring a cake!
okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
wow! this looks great!
yeah! okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (points to it.) umm, this one is made of bologna. (points.)
and-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
oh, just until the glue dries.
thank god!
(to a whole group) now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
ah.
okay? (to a different group) over here we have pink suede, which is nice. but umm, if it gets wet then you know it is going to shrink.
well maybe we just take that one away. (picks it up and throws it away.)
i also, did a little something in fur. but umm, that is really just for me. (rubs it against her cheek.) okay. so, why do not you go into your room and try these on and we will see—get a better idea of what is going to work.
thanks, you are such a good friend. and this is so weird.
ow!
toothpick?
yeah.
what are you trying on now?
the fruit roll up.
and?
delicious.
joey!
wait a minute! wait a minute! we have a winner!
what?! which one?!
the silly putty! it is not so silly anymore!
(in his head) she is your cousin. she is your cousin! if she knew what was going on in your head she would think you were sick! (she grabs some popcorn.) or would she? let us back up a second. she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. she was the one who turned down the lights. she was the one that wanted to rent logan’s run, the sexiest movie ever. (she grabs the blanket from behind him and looks at him.) oh, i know that look. forget it. i want it. she wants it. I am going in.
(in his head) say something clever! (pause.) okay, does not have to be clever, it just has to be words. say some words. (pause) any words will do. (pause) oh my god! this is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! (pause) there is nothing you can say to make this worse!! so just say something!! (pause.) (to her) i-i, i uh have not had sex in a very long time. (she leaves.) (in his head) yeah, you really should not have said anything.
phoebe! rachel! it is monica! i wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! (she bursts into the apartment to find only phoebe and rachel sitting on the couch.) oh.
oh monica, we are so sorry.
for what?
well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
and then for forgetting to invite you to it.
you al-you already had it?
yeah. well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you do not have either.
we ruined everything.
ugh…
well no wait a minute that is not true! no, what did, that was really sweet. and it kind of works out for the best.
what do you, what do you mean?
well now, i get to spend my shower with the only people i really love! i mean, i get all those presents (motions to the pile in the corner) without having to talk to people i do not even like!
surprise…
sur-surprise.
…monica.
and what is cool is, the character is from naples, right?
my whole family’s from naples!
oh! hey right! not a problem. (he starts taking off his clothes.) i totally understand. you need to y’know make sure i do not have any horrible scars or tattoos. do not you worry; i have nothing to hide. (he drops his pants and stands back up and looks down.) so there you go, that is me. (we cut to a camera angle looking at the casting director and movie director through joey’s legs.) one hundred percent natural! (suddenly, there is a thud as something falls off.) (everyone is shocked.) i tell ya, that has never happened before.
cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
oh! no problem! i… (cassie emerges from the bathroom and we once again visit slow motion barry white background music land with the sexy hair-flipping thing going on, only this time phoebe is entranced. for more information on denise richards you can visit your local library or look her up on the internet at her official website at www.deniserichards.com.)
(in her head) say something! say anything! ask her out! she is not your cousin!
oh, oh! it is on again!
you guys, can we please not watch this all right.
(on tv) oh, you said it mike. (rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) aw! there is got to be a better way!
can we please turn this off?
noo way, kevin.
(to chandler) are you intrigued?
you are flingin'-flangin' right i am!
(on tv, finishing installing the milk master 2000) wow, it is easy. (starts to poor the milk) now, i can have milk everyday.
well, it is official there are no good movies.
perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, (turns sideways on the couch) so that you can bunny bump against my back.
(entering) hey!
hey.
hey, man. what is up?
maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i did not show up at the audition i did not know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?!
well, I will tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it was not me.
yes, it was! it was him! uh huh! (they all stare at her) okay, it was me!
how is it you?
well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. i mean, chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and i had not found a place to hide yet. i-i-i meant to tell you, and i wrote it all down on my hand. see, all of it. (shows him her hand)
yep, that is my audition.
see, now this is why i keep notepads everywhere.
yep, and that is why we do not invite you to play.
well, estelle tried, you know. the casting director told her that i missed my chance.
that is unfair. I will call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
pheebs, you can not do that. the casting director does not talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
what a sad little life she must lead. okay, ooh (starts dialing).
what, what are you doing? what are you doing?
no, no, no, i know, i know, ooh. (on the phone in a different voice) 'hi, this is katelynn, from phoebe buffay's office. um, is um, ann there for phoebe, she will know what it is about.'
hang up, hang up. (reaches with his good arm, but phoebe grabs it and he tries to reach the phone with his other arm but can not because of the sling.)
(on phone) 'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office? estelle, no, i do not know what I am going to do with her. no. all right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
is anybody else scared?
(on phone) 'right, well look, um, if joey loses this audition, that is it for estelle. i do not care! annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to monica) i need a pen. (chandler hands her one, but she needs something to right on, so she tilts chandler's head over and writes on the back of his neck)
get the woman a pad! get the woman a pad! a pad! a pad!
oh, now you want a pad.
there is my boy! here is my boy! and here is his barbi (ben is holding a barbi doll) what is ah, what is my boy doing with a barbi?
yeah, it is, it is, it is cute. why, why, why does he have it, again?
you know what it is fine. if you are okay with the barbi thing, so am i.
give daddy the barbi! ben, give, give me the barbi. okay, how 'bout, do not you want to play with the monster truck? (makes a monster truck sound) no. okay, oh, oh, how about a dino-soilder? (squawks like a dinosaur)
ross, you are so pathetic. why can not your son just play with his doll? (uses the milk master 2000 to pour milk into her cereal)
(entering from her bedroom) i got to go to work. has anybody seen my left boob?
i love that movie. (joey is using it as a pillow)
there it is. joey, what are you doing?
I am sorry, it just felt nice.
(entering with his ringing phone) joe. joe! answer the phone.
hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater.
just do it! okay, it is janice and if i get it I am going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) oh, that is great I am going to have to see her tonight.
what is the big deal? why do not you want to see janice?
okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
and that is bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
noo.
you did not want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
no, it is like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm started going off in my head: 'run for your life! get out of the building!'
men are unbelievable.
what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
i know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that is why i do not want to go tonight, I am afraid I am going to say something stupid.
oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
hey, you know about that?!
look what do i do? i want to get past this, i do not want to be afraid of the commitment thing. i want to go through the tunnel, to the other side!
(to joey) where there is no fear of commitment.
do we have any...(turns around and bumps monica's fake chest) do we have any thoughts here?
well, I have never been through the tunnel myself, because as i understand it, you are not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. but, it seems to me it is pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. it have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! if you are afraid of bugs.....get a bug. right. in this case, you have a fear of commitment, so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
amazingly, that makes sense.
you think?
oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
yeah, joe, i assure you if I am staring down the barrel of a gun, I am pretty much peeing every which way.
oh, it is your audition from this morning. can i use the phone again?
sure pheebs, you know, that is what it is there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
come on baby, come on!
(on phone, in 'katelynn's' voice) 'hi, i have phoebe buffay returning a page. okay, well, um, she is in her car I will have to patch you through.'
very nice touch.
(in voice, on phone) 'okay, go ahead.' (in normal voice on phone) um, hi annie. (listens) fantastic! (to joey) you got it. (on phone) oh, okay, um, 'will he work for scale?' you ask me. well, i do not know about that, (joey clears his throat to signify yes) except that i do and he will. great, oh you are such a sweetheart. i would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next....(hangs up phone) op, went through a tunnel.
unbelievable.
thank you so much.
it was really fun, i mean I have never talked on a car phone before.
you were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there is this one other audition that i really, really want, and estelle could not get me in.
oh, i do not know. i mean it was fun one time.
come on, please, it will be just this one more, well actually it is two.
two?
yeah! well, well really it is three. please. you are so good at it. i love you.
okay, I will do it, but just these three, right
nooo, four.
because, i wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)
well, wait there is, there is more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you are my girlfriend, and that is what girlfriends should, should get.
well, not me. but that is what is happened, and, ah, and, and there is more. we should take a trip.
yep, we are a couple and that is what couples do. and, i want to meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents!
i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that I am here it is like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let us move in together.' and I would be okay.
it does not scare me!
oh, no, no, no, do not go! I have scared ya'! I have said too much! I am hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (janice leaves, chandler then calls janice to leave a message on her machine) hey, janice! it is me. um, yeah, i-i-i just want to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. (runs out the door)
honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)
so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
that is never good.
then i got all needy and clingy.
okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it is not so bad. how did you leave it?
she said she would call me.
oh god.
welcome to our side of the tunnel.
this ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
yeah, well that is that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. we sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
you know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you got to switch to low-fat.
yeah, you do.
so, you do not think I am terminal?
well, no, not at all, you are not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
okay, okay. so, should i call her?
this is a very critical time right now. if you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. you want her back you have to start acting aloof.
she has to know that your not ready.
right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof.
so I am not, not going to lose her?
oooh, honey, you are not a total loser.
i said, 'so I am not going to lose her?'
oh.
guess who is here. it is the toughest guy in toy land, ben. (singing) 'a real american hero. I am g.i. joe!' drop the barbi, drop the barbi.
g.i. joe? do you really think he is going to fall for that?
(entering) g. i. joe! cool! can i play?
look ben, it is a toy that protects you.s. oil interests overseas!
(entering) helloo! oh! (sees joey and starts to leave)
pheebs! there you are!
no it is not, sorry.
but phoebe, wait! wait! phoebe. phoebe! (catches her in the hallway)
oh, joey! oh, okay, see i did not recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
look listen, that tv movie i went in for? did you hear anything? i think i got a shot at it.
yes! they called and you did not get it! okay, i mean you did not get it, I am sorry, I am sorry.
it is okay, these things happen.
but they should not happen, you know what, you are, you are in a terrible, terrible business. oh god, i do not want to be the person who makes your face look like that.
I am, I am okay. see. (tries to smile, but fails horribly)
oh, now you are sad and creepy, oh. you know what, i, I am sorry i quit, okay, i just quit.
no! no, no you can not quit! you are the best agent i ever had! look pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can not take it personally.
not personal, really, well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent.
they actually said that?
yeah. ooh god, there is that face again! see i can not do this job! i...
no, no, no, see that is why you have to do this job, agents always lie. you know, estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way', but this, i can use this. (in a very bad italian accent) i canna work on a new accent.
yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. yeah.
(running into the hall, in slow motion) you will never get me, joe!!! (he then pretends that he gets shot repeatedly and falls back against joey and chandler's door, dead.)
(in a british accent) hello, janice.
(in accent) oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been?
(normal voice) no. not anymore.
yeah, huh. I am just uh, you know I am just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
well, I am sorry if my friends are not as sophisticated as yours.
here in chelsea.
a woman's
(shyly) chelsea.
can i be that guy?
okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
okay, shoot.
okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.
i did not get it?
no. they said you 'were not believable as a human being.' so, you can work on that.
okay, what else?
um, the off-broadway play people said 'you were pretty but dumb.'
oh.
oh no wait, I am sorry, that is 'pretty dumb.'
look, it is okay, no, no, no, really, look um, i really appreciate this pheebs, but i think I am going to have to go back to estelle.
oh.
yeah, well do not get me wrong, you are a better agent than she is, but at least with her i do not want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
yeah, no, i understand.
you do, thanks.
yeah. sorry. (she starts to leave)
wait a minute.
what?
wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
(in a coy tone) oh, you caught me. i am so busted.
(in a really, really bad italian accent) that is-ah what i suspected-ah.
....and then i just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
I have actually ruined this have not i? it is time for the good ice cream now, right?
yeah, it is.
you know what, everything's going to be okay.
(answering phone) hello. hi, janice! can you hold on for a second? okay. (to monica and rachel) okay, what do i do?
shhh...i do not know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
if-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
yeah.
hello!
oh wait, you know what, i got it, i got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. be sleepy.
yes, and grumpy.
what are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) hello, janice. hi, I am so glad that you called, i know I have been acting a really weird lately. and, it is just because I am crazy about you, and i just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I am sorry. (listens) really?! (listens) really?!
he is soo lucky, if janice were a guy, she would be sleeping with somebody else by now.
(on phone) i love you too.
aw, it is soo unfair. (they both start digging into the 'good' ice cream)
hey, i do not know what to tell you guys that is the doll he chose.
look, g. i. joe's in, barbi's out. and if you guys can not deal with it, that is your 'too bad.'
what are you being such a weenie for? so he has a barbi, big deal. you used to dress up like a woman.
what?
well, you used to dress up in mom's clothes all the time.
what are you talking about?
the big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
okay, you are totally making this up.
how can you not remember? you made us call you...bea.
(remembering) oh god.
was not there a little song?
there was no song. (to monica) there was no song!
(singing) 'i am bea.'
okay.
'i drink tea.'
okay, that is, that is enough. (retreats to the bathroom)
'....will not you, will not you, will not you.... '
(coming out of the bathroom) will not you dance around with me.
a-ha!!! (they all start laughing, as ross hides in the bathroom)
oh, hey joey.
uh, hey.
listen, i need to ask you something. ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
(afraid) yeah.
yeah. well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he would come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing iceman in the exercise yard just could not wait till monday.
so he can not come?
no, and so there is no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, i would just really love it if you would do it.
seriously?
yeah, you have... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. i mean, you have always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
i am pretty wisdomous.
so... what do you say?
are you kidding? phoebe, i would be honored. (they hug)
oh, thank you. i hope... i hope you know how much you mean to me.
(takes her hand) listen, i hope... that you know... (has difficulty saying it) i do not want you to see your father cry, go to your room!
oh.
oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
(her mobile phone rings) oh, it is my wedding planner. she is driving me crazy! (she answers) hello... hey, ok, stop screaming! ok? so, halibut. all right, so salmon, either way. i do not-i do not... it does not matter to me!
(she enters with a headset on and she is speaking into the microphone) well, it matters to me!
well, i do not care, so you pick!
did you just hung up on me? (she hangs up too) all right, look, i need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
uh-uh. ok. what time is that.
you do not know military time?
why, i must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
just subtract twelve.
ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
(screaming) six of the clock!
ok.
ok. hold on. (her mobile phone rings) geller here! no! i said it has to be there by 4 of the clock. goodbye. (she hangs up) oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
ice sculpture? that sounds really fancy! i told you i just want a simple wedding.
please... honey, leave the details to me. now i want to make this day as special for you as i can. now, ok, i was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
what harpist? my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums.
ooh... she backed out.
she did? why?
i made her. (phoebe looks shocked) steel drums do not really say "elegant wedding". nor does marjorie's overwhelming scent.
(looking angry) hey! she will shower when tibet is free.
hey!
hey!
you look great. I am so glad we are having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them.
okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the actual wedding.
rehearse it!
hi! (he kisses phoebe)
oh, (he goes towards mike in order to shake hands but mike hugs him) hey, oh... i... i was-i was going for a hand shake.
that is why!
so rach.
yeah.
where is emma?
oh, monica made me send her to my mother's. apparently babies and weddings do not mix.
(coming) are you still crying about your damn baby? pheebs, you got to keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. your see these clowns all the time! (she takes off)
hey, you are mike's parents, right?
ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
you know, on the one hand you are happy for them, but on the other hand it is hard to let go.
hey, I am not that fond of you either, ok buddy? but I am just trying to be nice for the kids!
(to rachel) you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we are doing in the wedding tomorrow.
yeah, i thought we would be groomsmen, but would not they have asked us by now? when did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
uh... november?
i want to say it is not looking good.
hey pheebs...
what is up?
uhm... you have not told these guys what they are doing in the wedding yet.
heh.
uhm... well, they are not in the wedding.
what? (ross and chandler do not know what to say, so there is an embarrassing long pause)
well, this is really awkward (staring at the floor) oh, and i can leave!
I am sorry you guys but, you know, mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
oh, man!
this is like figure skating team all over again. (phoebe and ross glare at him astonished) i mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) i mean- i mean the balance beam. (to ross) help me!
football!
thank you.
(looking at phoebe eating something) pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
oh! i though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
yeah, i changed them. i-i sent you a fax about it!
i do not have a fax machine.
ah, well then there are going to be a few surprises!
i can not believe we are going to be the only people that are not in this wedding.
i know, i hate being left out of things.
and it is a wedding! it would be weird if I am not in it...
fine. we are just sitting here. alone. doing nothing. it is our rehearsal for tomorrow.
what happened?
who cares, and?
I will do it!
(standing up too) m-me-me-me!
pick me, i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus.
no, mike, no, no. you want to pick me, i mean... watch! (he mimics the groommens way of walking down the aisle with a bridesmaid) huh?
(to chandler) well, if phoebe's choosing, then say hello to mike's next groomsman.
oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me!
please, you are going down!
you are going downer!
is that what they say on the figure skating team?
(almost crying) i would not know, i did not make it! (they hug)
so, you know I am filling in for phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?
oh, hey, my pleasure. (he suddenly becomes very serious) so what are your intentions with my phoebe?
oh, a wiseacre. (mike looks bewildered). no, no, no, i understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? is not that kind of unstable?
strike two!
strike three! you only get one more, mike!
so, what did you decide?
i decided to pee.
mike did not tell you? you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out.
oh no, no. i can not choose between you two! i love you both so much!
just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
oh, i do not want to choose! it is (rachel is walking by). oh okay, wait. rach! listen i have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
(excited and clapping her hands in front of her face) goody, what is it!
well, there is a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between ross and chandler. so good luck with that.
what, what, what, no, i do not want to do that.
all right, i guess I will have to find a new bridesmaid.
I will do it! (monica approaches)
ok, it is 2100 hours. (to phoebe) time for your toast. (mike appears)
you had a bathroom break at 2030. pee on your own time, mike! (to phoebe and mike). now, in regard to the toast, okay, you want to keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. okay. you just get in, do your thing and get out!
(very serious) it is 2101 and i am not amused. (pause). ok, the bride and groom have a few words they would like to say. (everyone sits and phoebe gets up)
ok. hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. so tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but mike and i did not get off to the best start. (she reads a note). my friend joey and i decided to fix each other up with friends so i, i... (monica is twirling her hands in order to make phoebe speed up her speech) oh i... hum... i gave it a lot of thought and i fixed him up with my friend mary ellen who could not be here tonight because... (monica is tapping her watch with her finger) it is not important... she is in rehab. anyway, so, ok, joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike, only he did not have a friend mike so he just brought, uhm, my mike and, and (monica clears her throat) but despite, you know... it got... it got good. ok, i want to take a moment to mention my mother, who could not be here...
and... moment's over! (rachel, joey and chandler all turn and look disapprovingly towards monica but she just shrugs it off) so, ok, uh, i can forget that. i can forget that and uhm... (she is flipping cards skipping half of them) oh this is funny! oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... oh, ok, well, uhm, i (monica is miming cut). ok, ok, i, ok, i.... monica i can not do it like this! this is my wedding! okay, i do not want this (she mimes monica's when she was twirling her hands) or this (she taps her watch) or this (she mimes cut) ok? i just wanted a simple wedding! where my fiancee can go to the bathroom anytime he wants! (pause) you know what? you are done.
what?
you are fired! (mimes the cut again) (pause and she raises her glass) cheers! (chandler raises his, smiling and monica stares at him and he puts down his glass.)
hey!
happy wedding day!
oh, happy my wedding day to you!
ok-dokey, joey, listen. this is going to be bridesmaid central, all right? we are going to have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, i had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
oh, man! i would not have had breakfast if i knew there was going to be corsages!
hi. about last night... i know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... my point is, uh, well, I am willing to take my job back.
oh, well that is ok. i think you and i will do much better if you are just... here as a bridesmaid.
oh, is that so? ok. if that is really what you want, then here... i give you the headset. well, i do not really want to give you the headset. well i guess if you are taking over, you should probably return these messages. (hands her a stack of papers with messages and calls to return)
wow, this is a lot!
uh-huh, but I am sure you can handle this. i mean, i have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I am sure you will do fine.
you won awards?
mm-mh. i printed them out on my computer.
hey!
hi.
where is rach?
she is in her room, why?
i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I am not going to watch chandler up there while I am sitting in the seats like some chump! (he goes to rachel's room, knocks the door and enters the room). (very fake gasp) oh! my god! you are breathtaking!
what d'you want?
you have not by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
oh, ross, c'mon, please! do not make this harder than it already is!
I am not! I am making it easier! pick me!
well, chandler said that it is really important to him too!
listen, listen. whoever you pick is going to walk down the aisle with you! now, i promise i will not say a word, but if you pick chandler he is going to be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
(waving his fist in the air in triumph) yes, yes!
sven i do not understand what you are saying! what is wrong with the flowers? lorkins? what the hell are lorkins?
i know.
listen, mike, if you were swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?
right there! that is why I am marrying you!
(to mike) hello michael.
may i have a word with you, please?
have a seat. (mike sits on his bed, and joey towers over him. he starts talking in an italian godfather-type voice) last night, i tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... (shakes his head) i cannot allow this.
more back talk. and yes, i may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "family honor 2: thissa time itsa personal."
i want you to take this seriously! phoebe is very very important to me, ok? and i want to make sure that you are going to take care of her.
(very satisfied and smiling) that is what i wanted to hear! because she is family, ok, and now you are going to be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
(almost crying) that was me!
hi
hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he will walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you will be getting some comedy!
even so, i think I am going to pick ross.
let me tell you why you need to pick me. (goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who did not even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if I am the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are going to come rushing back.
all right fine, i pick you.
(getting up and raising his fist in victory) y-y-yeeesss! make "groom" for chandler.
(not amused by his pun but forcing a smile anyway) oh my...
no! we are going to do it my way. (listens) because your way is stupid! alright i got to go, i have another call, reverend. (switches calls) hello?
I am glad we had this little talk.
okay.
bye.
oh my god, what is it doing here?
(obviously enjoying this setback) ugh, i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. (by now she can barely keep herself from smiling) uh! what a pickle.
(starting to panic) oh my god, everything is such a mess. why is this happening to me?
(staring at the ice sculpture) how bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? (they all glare at him)
how is it going?
(smiling to himself) good. I am just getting some coffee. so I am alert for the wedding.
(smiling to himself too) that is what i was doing too.
(barely containing himself at this point) well, you have fun tonight.
you too.
oh, i will.
me too.
wait a minute, i know why I am being such an ass, why are you?
I am not supposed to tell you.
I am not supposed to tell you!
you told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at rachel)
well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. you and me together again. (he winks at her and rachel looks disgusted)
rach, rach, knock knock.
who is there?
I will tell you at the wedding.
uh.
you know what, i can not do this. i do not know which one of you guys to pick.
what? a dog? no! rachel gets to choose.
(sarcastic) wow, this is a tough one. i think I am going to have to go with the dog.
alright, wait, so what you are saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? are you, are you freaking kidding me!?
(enjoying what she is seeing) how is it going?
(to monica) help me.
what?
i want you to be crazy bitch again.
(sounds moved) really?
(nearly in tears) please?
you really want me to come back?
more than i want to get married.
ok people, we are back in business! (gets her headset out of her purse) oh god, we have missed you soo much! (takes all the notes from phoebe) ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I will take care of everything.
hey, what are you guys going to do?
(sounds scared already) about what?
the blizzard. i just saw on the news, it is like the worst snow storm in 20 years! they already closed all the bridges and tunnels. (opens the curtains to reveal a snow storm outside)
ooh! but the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from new jersey!
i do not think they are.
(to rachel) haha! looks like you are not going to be in the wedding either. (looks at phoebe) so sorry pheebs.
(putting down her phone) well, the club lost it is power.
yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
since when do you watch the news?
uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
(to phoebe and mike) i can not believe you guys are not going to be able to get married today.
i know.
wow, you know, it is so beautiful out there. you always wanted to get married outside. why do not you guys just do it on the street?
what?
well, look, it is hardly snowing anymore. i mean you could not ask for a more romantic setting. this could be the simple wedding you have always wanted!
(turning to mike) what do you think?
me too! (turning to monica) monica, do you think we could do it?
(thinking) affirmative!
(walking around with her headset still on) ok let us get these chairs out here! gunther, hit the christmas lights. (he does so and the lights above the chairs light up. monica looks satisfied) okay, who left the ice sculpture (picks up a piece of ice from the ground) on the steam grate? (nobody answers)
so technically, would this person be in the wedding?
no, but chandler, hello... are not you scared of dogs?
I am not scared. (moves towards mike and chappy) I will just take little chappy and... (he backs out) he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed.
(takes chappy from mike) well, i guess I am in the wedding then. ha haaa... (smells chappy) he stinks!
level 1 alert. i repeat, level 1. this is not a drill. okay we have got a situation. the minister just called. he is snowed in. he can not make it.
oh hey, do not worry. I am still ordained from your wedding.
really?
yeah, you would think I would give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? huhuh...
uhm, ministers do not ride the subway for free.
i had to read the bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle.
(quickly) I will do it.
I will...
(to ross) na ha ha... (to chappy) ne he he... (ross moves chappy to chandler, who quickly backs away) ah ah...
okay, mike and joey, get in position. chandler, come with me. (they walk off, ross looks down to chappy, who he is holding and he gets a whiff of the dog's smell. he is clearly disgusted by it.)
okay, joey's doing the ceremony and chandler's giving you away.
oh, okay. hi new dad. (chandler waves)
so, you are ready to do this?
uhuh, uhuh... oh my god! this is really happening.
oh phoebe, I am so happy for you honey. (she gives her a kiss)
oh, thank you.
i love you. (phoebe leans in to kiss her.) oh, wait, wait, wait! no hugs. the dresses... oh what the hell. (the girls hug)
i love you guys.
okay. (in her microphone) it is zero hour. all teams execute on my count. (to all) let us get this bad boy on the road.
(to monica) is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
(checking her clipboard) i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
oh yeah! (monica walks outside)
okay marjorie, hit it.
geez ross, you could have showered.
it is the dog.
groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) we have got a broken arrow. bridesmaid down! (realizes) oh, that is me.
ready?
(nervously) okay.
okay.
oh wait, oh no. wait.
wow! are not you going to be cold?
i do not care... I will be my something blue.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
na-ah.
friends, family, dog... thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. the cold has now spread to my special place... so I am going to do the short version of this. phoebe and mike are perfect for each other. and i know i speak for every one here... when i wish them a lifetime of happiness. who has the rings?
(whispering to phoebe) okay...
when i was growing up, i did not have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and i always knew that something was missing. but now I am standing here today, knowing that i have everything I am ever going to need... you are my family. (she puts the ring on mikes finger)
oh wait, oh i forgot... and uhm... i love you... and you have nice eyes.
uh joey...
yeah?
chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
oh, okay. phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
i do.
mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
i now pronounce you... husband and wife.
i got married! (everyone applauds) could someone get me a coat, I am freaking freezing.
that really was an incredible wedding.
it was, yeah. i kind of do not want it to end. hey, you want to come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
I would love to, but it is 2300 hours and I am about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
nice. oh hey, what about ross?
i do not know. maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
come on chappy, do your business. make! ma-ake! i did not sign on for this.
what the hell is that?!! (to monica) what the hell is that? is that you? (monica nods her head no, and rachel realizes what is making that sound.) ohhhhhhh! (storms over to chandler and joey’s with monica in trail.)
boy, you are really not a morning person.
(angrily) back off!!! (she starts banging on their door.) get up! get up! get up! god damn it! get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!
what is that noise?
you!
it is the chick! she is…going through some changes.
what kind of changes?
well the vet seems to think that is she is becoming a rooster. (the rooster crows.) we are getting a second opinion.
hey!
hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
well, I have been up since six. thanks to somebody is dumb-ass rooster.
you guys you really should get rid of those animals. they should not be living in an apartment.
yeah! especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
all right. I am going to go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I am ready to have frank and alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
now, how will they know if you are ready?
oh, they are just going to umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
oh, i can uh, check that for ya.
okay everyone, think thick.
hi! wish me luck!
oh, good luck.
good luck. (to monica) and I am still right!
that is sooo not true!
what?
she is mad because i know today’s her laundry day and that means she is wearing her old lady underpants.
i can check that for ya.
i just—i can not believe that you think that you and chandler know me and rachel better than we know you.
well… we-we do. you can only eat tic tacks in even numbers.
yeah, what is that about?
(to rachel) and you… ross, i believe, if you check rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
(he does so, and finds a half-eaten box of cookies.) you are good. (tries a cookie.) these are not.
I am so not impressed. everybody snacks when they shop.
yeah.
oh yeah? ross, how many items left in that bag?
five.
okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
how many guesses do you get?
six.
challenge extended.
deal!
challenge excepted.
all right, we will start with…apples.
we will be starting with apples.
(to ross) stop that now!
yes!
okay. uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.
diet soda.
yes. yes. yes. (they are perfect so far.)
orange juice.
no! there is no orange juice in there! we win!!
ha-ha!
they have another guess.
okay, well, we won that one.
okay, the last thing…
oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (whispers something in joey’s ear.)
no-no, not for like another two weeks.
i got it! scotch… tape. (they are right.)
how did you know she would buy scotch tape?
well, we used there is up last night making scary faces.
aww, man!
all right! ten buck! fork it over! cough it up! pay the piper! give me it.
that does not mean you know us better, i-i want a rematch.
yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions, real personal questions.
yeah! and the winner gets a hundred bucks.
serious?
are you scared?
no! all right, who-who makes up the questions?
ross will do it.
oh sure, "ross will do it!" it is not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
fine! we will ask phoebe.
no-no-no, i-i want to play.
oh! i knew it! i knew it! i felt really thick this morning.
embryossss? as in, "more than one?"
five? okay, where am i giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
that is it! 25 percent? that means that is it is like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
okay, well y’know what, do not worry you guys, ‘because I am-I am going to do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
whoa!! that—okay, that is a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. (to dr. zane) so, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that i can do y’know just to like help make sure i get pregnant?
wow! you guys really do not know anything!
you guys! do you realize that any minute now, phoebe can be pregnant?
huh.
i know! i know, it is such a huge, life-altering thing.
i know.
the test is ready.
okay, each team will answer ten questions. the first team that answers the most questions wins. okay, the categories are, fears and pet peeves, ancient history, literature, and it is all relative. now, the coin toss to see who goes first. (he flips the coin and they all watch it hit the table and stop. then they all look up at him, to see who goes first.) okay, somebody call it this time.
tails!
it is heads. (the guys celebrate.) gentlemen, pick your category.
fears and pet peeves.
what is monica’s biggest pet peeve?
animals dressed as humans.
that is correct. ladies?
same category?
according to chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
michael flatley, lord of the dance!
that is correct.

althea is correct.

we will take literature!!
every week, the tv guide comes to chandler and joey’s apartment. what name appears on the address label?
chandler gets it! it is chandler bing!

I am afraid the tv guide comes to chinandolor bong.

actually, it is miss chinandolor bong.
hello, tiny embryos. well, I am-I am phoebe buffay, hi! I am-I am-I am hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. you should know, that we are doing this for frank and alice, who you know, you have been there! umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. okay, and-and i promise that I will keep you safe and warm until you are ready to have them take you home, so… oh! and also, umm next time you see me, I am screaming, do not worry, that is what is supposed to happen.
uh-huh. (to the embryos) good luck.
all right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.
(shouting) it is all relative!!
you do not have to shout everything.
(shouting) I am sorry!
ooh. what is the name of chandler’s father’s las vegas all-male burlesque?
viva las gaygas!
unfortunately that is correct.
all right, we have a tie. luckily, i have prepared for such an event. (he opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) the lightning round!
thirty seconds, all the questions you can answer.
you guys are dead, i am so good at lighting rounds.
i majored in lightning rounds. all right, we are going to destroy you.

all right, I am going to go take a pregnancy test, right now.
oh wow! you can tell this soon.
well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than western medicine.
(entering from chandler’s bedroom, i guess, and sees the foosball table.) oh my god! i can not believe you guys are actually think you are moving in here!
well believe it baby!
well i-i-I am not moving.

i knew it!
i do not care, I am not going anywhere.
cool, girl roommate.
well?
nope, not knocked up yet.
it is only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.
yeah, all right. meanwhile, I am going to do whatever i can to help this so, I am just going to y’know, lie it your chair, (she climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) y'know? yeah, good, I am let gravity y’know, do its jobs.
hey, rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
no! put that box down! we are not going anywhere! this is my apartment and i like it! this is a girl’s apartment! that is a boy’s apartment, it is dirty and it smells. this is pretty. it is-it is so pretty! and look, and it is-it is purple! and I am telling you, you with the steady hand, i am not moving, and now i have got the steady hand. (she holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)
I will take care of it.
that is right! you do what the hand says!
how did it go?
i lost our mattresses.
(singing) "are you in there little fetus?
hey!
oh. oh.
hey, do not mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.
all right, i will. no, i will. but umm, y’know just remember that it is still really early, okay so, if it says that I am not pregnant, that does not mean that I am not going to get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so i do not go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.
great. (goes to take the test.)
y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
hey, do not get mad at us! no one forced you to raise the stakes!
that is not true. she did! she forced me!
hey, we would still be living here if had not gotten the question wrong!
well it stupid, unfair question!
do not blame the questions!
would you all stop yelling in our apartment! you are ruining moving day for us!
will you stop calling it your apartment!
but it is our apartment!
no it is not!
you guys! you guys! you are going to have a baby! they are going to have a baby!
okay, but this can not be good for the baby.
i can not find garbage bags!
oh, i think i saw some in here.
what is it?!
i do not know! but maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it will die.
i can not believe we are living here!
what?! what-what is it?!
did you see the size of the closets?!
i can not believe we live here!
okay, the reason why i asked you guys out to brunch today is because i have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
oh my god! this is it! (she and phoebe hold hands.) (to phoebe) i really hope it is you!
i hope it is you.
me too!
first of all um, i love you both so much and you are both so important to me…
okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! who is it?!
well umm, i was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. like hypothetically, if phoebe were mine…
yes!!! oh!!
hypothetically!
still.
if phoebe were my maid of honor…
uh-hmm.
rachel would be phoebe’s, i would be rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
yeah that is actually a pretty good idea.
yeah, I will do that. so who gets to be yours?
(laughs) well that is the best part. umm, you guys get to decide!
wh-why is that the best part?
because then i do not have to!
well of course we will help you decide! we will do anything we can to help you! now, i would like to make a toast, to the future mrs. chandler bing (a woman at the table behind them overhears chandler’s name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…
I am really not deciding!
fine!
yeah that is right.
aww, and good luck to you too! (to monica and rachel) what a nice lady!
die hard still great!
yep. hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
what did you rent?
die hard 2.
(looking at the tape) joey, this is die hard 1 again.
oh, well we watch it a second time and its die hard 2!
joey, we just saw it!
and?
and it will be cool to see it again! yeah!
dude, you did not say die hard. is everything okay?
yeah, i just got uh, got plans.
well, john mclane had plans!
no, see the thing is i want to get out of here before joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
what are you talking about? bitch.
hey rachel?
yeah?
umm, when i get married will you be my maid of honor?
really?!
uh-hmm.
oh my god phoebe! i mean I am just—wait a minute. if I am your maid of honor that means you are monica’s.
oh! well, if that is what you want…
ohh! no way phoebe! i want to be monica’s!
but why does it even matter?!
why does it matter so much to you?!
because this one is now! and-and it is two of our best friends! who knows what you are going to marry!
what-what if i marry ross—or joey?
(gasps) you would not! okay look, rachel i know you really want to do this, but i-I have never been maid of honor to anyone before! and i know you have done it at least twice!
yeah but phoebe…
and no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (rachel stops talking.) oh i guess that was it.
okay. okay. it is—since you have never done it before you can be monica’s made of honor.
oh, thank you so much! (they hug.) okay.
I am going to marry someone good y’know.
oh i know.
better than chandler. (phoebe exhales as if to say, "like what is not?")
what happened?!!
well, i do not know!!
we fell asleep! that is all.
yeah. yep. yeah. all right, well uh, I would better go.
i think that would be best.
yeah. all right, I will talk to you later.
okay. but not about this!
no! never! never! (pause, then joey wants to shake ross’s hand.) bye.
no touch! no touch!
yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey i was at brunch. this woman overheard that i was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.
that is sweet.
no, it is more like a (sarcastically) good luck.
so uh, what did this woman look like?
she was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
no, no i only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (thinks a little while.) hold on one second; let me check this out. (he gets up and grabs a photo album.
what are you doing?
well, let us see… (finding the picture he wants.) okay uh, is that her? (pointing to the picture.)
oh my god yes! who is she?
julie grath, my camp girlfriend.
did you break up with her?
(pause) no, we are still together. yeah we went out for two summers, and then i broke up with her.
why?
well, ‘because she came back the third summer and she would gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
fat?!
i did not say fat! i said, "fa-aa-aw-ow…"
you broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
yeah. yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! does she still feel bad?
well, apparently she does.
well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (monica is not amused by that statement.) seriously, good luck marrying me.
hey! what is going on?
phoebe is going to be monica’s maid of honor!
hey! well i hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (phoebe glares at him.)
(shocked) you have been maid of honor before?!!
see? this is exactly why you should not lie!
all right that is it! i am maid of honor!
na-uh, i am!
how come you are?!
because i cared enough to lie!
hey-hey-hey-hey, i can help you decide who should do it! yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you would handle maid of honor type situations.
what are you talking about?
like when i want a job, i go to an audition and if I am the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
oh uh, me and ross can be the judges.
(to rachel) well, it is better than us deciding.
oh, come on! this is crazy! can not we just flip a coin?!
no! coins hate me!
okay. okay fine, y’know what? we will let ross and joey decide. (ross enters.) (in a sexy voice.) hiiiii, ross! sweetie.
hey there, you handsome thing. (rachel and phoebe exit.)
wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as georgio.
hi.
just uh, brought back your videos.
uh hey look uh ross, look i think we need to talk about before.
no! no we do not!
yes we do! now look, that was the best nap i ever had!!
i… i do not know what you are talking about.
come on! admit it! that was the best nap you ever had!
I have had better.
okay! when?!
all right! all right! it was the best nap ever!
uh-huh!
I have said it! okay?! but it is over joey!
i want to do it again.
we can not do it again.
why not?
because it is weird!
fine! do you want something to drink?
sure, what do you got?
warm milk and excedrin p.m. (ross just leaves.)
chandler! (knocks on the door.) chandler! i just figured out who you are!
can you figure out what I am doing?
you are lewis posin.
who?
lewis posin! he was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. do you know why?
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
no! but because he thought i was to faaaaa…. (chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) and every time i think about it, it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade! y’know, i-i really think that you should apologize to julie.
what? are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.
no, i know. but y’know what? it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me.
okay, i will do it. but i have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
okay, all right, this is how it is going to work. we are going to give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
no, 10 is the highest.
why is 10 the highest?
because it is the highest. (joey shrugs his shoulders) okay, rachel you are up first. (rachel stands up and gets ready.) situation no. 1: you are with monica, the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet. go! (joey is playing the part of monica.)
(crying) i do not want to marry chandler!
okay, uh…
I have got cold feet.
…it is going to be okay!
no, one man for the rest of my life? i do not know if i can do it! this means I will never get to sleep with joey!
look monica, getting cold feet is very common. y’know, it is-it is just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler. and also, i ran out on a wedding. you do not get to keep the gifts.
(out of his monica character) very good! drawing on your own experience, i like that!
thanks!
yes, very nice rachel.
thank you judges.
ugh, what a kiss ass.
oh!
okay, phoebe…
yes! your honor?
we are now in the ceremony, monica is about to say, "i do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. what do you do? go!
(playing the drunk uncle) when monica was a little girl, i remember that—(phoebe screams and tackles him)—ooh!! ow! very good!
oh!
yes! excellent! perfect score!
wait a minute! she just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
hey! do you want do you want a little taste of pheebs?!
it is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
ohh, wait a minute, we have not pre…
go!
okay! okay! umm, webster’s dictionary defines marriage as… (ross and joey start writing.) okay!! forget that! that sucks!! okay, never mind! forget it! umm, umm, okay, uh… i met, i-i met, i met monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and i became friends with chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
thank you. thank you very much. umm, I have known them separately and I have known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. so i would like to raise my glass (grabs a glass and holds it up) to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
wow. (to ross) good speech.
yeah, it really was!
aw, thanks!
okay phoebe, i guess you are next (to joey) although i really do not see the point.
yeah.
okay, i can not believe that monica and chandler are getting married. i remember talking about this day with rachel while we were showering together, naked. (raises her glass and drinks.)
and she is back in the game.
(she opens the door) julie hi! chandler bing, i, i guess you remember me.
(to monica) it is a nickname, I will explain later.
it is pretty clear.
ah, uh, i owe you a long overdue apology. i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
you-you-you did not know that. (pause as she nods no.) well, i guess my work here is done!
all right, well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well. okay? you should be proud of yourselves. and-and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. well, except for rachel—damnit!
really?! i won!
what?!
I am sorry rach, it was, it was really close.
well then i demand a recount! (hmm, i wonder where I have heard that before.)
actually, it was not that close.
no! y’know what? no! no! you thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—we are going to flip a coin! (phoebe gasps.) all right?! (she flips the coin.) heads! (looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)
the coins have finally forgiven me!
well y’know what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (runs out.)
(running after her) rach, it is going to be okay! (to ross and joey) you guys are the best!
boy i tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
yeah?
yeah! i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (raises his eyebrows, questioning ross to see if he wants to join him.)
why-why would i care about that?
no reason, I am just saying that uh… that is where I will be.
as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself. i think that I am going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do.
why do not you just stop doing stupid things? then you would not have to apologize.
i would really love it if could do both.
all right, i…i have to ask.
what?
are you going to break up with me if i get fat again?
what?!
well, you broke up with julie grath! how much weight could she have gained?
a hundred and forty-five pounds.
in one year?! my god what did she eat? her-her family! that is not the point.
look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but i was 15!
well… that is not the only time this was an issue. you remember when umm, you spent thanksgiving with us? you called me fat.
okay. okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
how?
you were not supposed to hear that! i said that behind you back!
what if i have babies, okay? i mean I am going to look different. I am okay with that, but I am not sure that you are!
look you have to realize i do not think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (monica glares at him.) see this is one of things that i can apologize for later! look, what i mean is you are monica! okay? and i am in love with monica.
keep going.
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you.
even if i shrink down to two inches tall?
I would carry you around in my pocket.
i love you. (they hug and kiss.)
skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
hi pheebs.
hi!
hi! i just want to apologize. I am really sorry i was a baby.
that is ridiculous rachel, we were all babies once. (rachel looks at her.) oh, you mean today.
yeah. yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. and-and y’know i was thinking about it, if-if you are monica’s maid of honor that means i get to be yours.
oh yeah!
yeah! oh, umm when-when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…
oh that is so sweet thanks.
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves. and-and ohh god this is funny, look, this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (shows phoebe the picture.) and look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because i was wonder woman. oh and here is a little purse that i found. (hands her the purse) y’know i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
ohh.
and umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘because, people cry at weddings. (starting to cry.) I am just going to grab a couple of these.
this stuff is great!
oh, i forgot this was in here. umm, this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monica’s something borrowed and it is blue. (starts to cry again.) yeah…
y’know rach, i think that, i think you should be monica’s made of honor.
you do? why?
because i think it means more to you.
but pheebs, y’know you earned it.
its fine. i mean, this is something that you have been thinking about since you were what, 14? (she is referring to the halloween picture.)
no, i was ten. i just developed early.
(looking at the picture again) man alive!
(entering) hey, what is going on?
hey!
well, we just decided that rachel is going to be your maid of honor.
(gasps) ohh, wow! that is great! (rachel and monica hug.) oh wow! we really have to start planning! i have, i have a lot of really specific ideas! we should probably get together like four times per week. you can come over to my place; we will get together before work! what do you say, 6:30, my place? I am so excited! (runs out leaving rachel completely stunned and phoebe laughing.)
yeah okay, you laugh now, but she is going to be yours. (phoebe gets suddenly scared.)
great nap.
it really was.
(reacting first by jumping up) dude! what the hell are you doing?! god! (heads for his room leaving ross.)
(slowly stands up and says quietly) excuse me. (exits.)
(to monica) hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
i will not give you anything, but you will owe me 2.95.
done.
(entering) hey. i need an atlas! i need an atlas!
why? (in a motherlike tone) do you have a report due?
i have a date with this diplomat i met while i was giving free massages outside the un and, i do not know where his country is.
okay, let us start with the free messages outside the un.
oh!! that is my new thing. i figure bodies at peace, make peace.
wow! you might just get the first nobel prize in rubbing. so what country is this guy from?
ick-neck-tree-anis..... there is a ‘g’ in there.
where is that?
in your atlas!
i do not have an atlas.
oh.
oh, but wait i do have a globe.
oh.
hold on.
so pheebs what is this guy like?
umm, well he is very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he does not speak any english, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
‘kay, here you go. (hands her this tiny little globe.)
what is this?
it is a globe and, a pencil sharpener.
(entering) hey, does anybody need anything copied? I am going down to the xerox place.
oh, no thanks.
okay listen, just give me anything i can make two of.
well, if you do not have anything to copy, why are you going down there?
yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
yeah! you want to come?
yeah!
come on chloe! finish up with your customer first. come on chloe! come on chloe!!
uh-oh.
uh, y'know what, we are having second thoughts about our copying needs. and we will need a little more time to think about it.
(to joey) okay, that hurt us.
well ah, ........y'know.
both of us? (points to chandler and himself)
we will be there.
all right, rock on. (does the ‘hang 10’ sign, then hides his face in shame.)
me too. although this city is my home, so. so that is dumb what i said, do not tell him i said that. umm, you make something up. (mischa does so and sergei kisses her hand.) nice, (to mischa) thank you. this is me. here.
(to mischa) thank you, very much! oh! (to sergei) thank you!
(to mischa) okay, y'know what, you do not have to do that now. (mischa translates that to sergei) no-no-no-no!! not him, you do not! (mischa tells sergei he can proceed and steps away) well the moment’s over.
oh.
(pointing to the globe) see there it is right there.
wow! it is small.
yeah. but sergei said it took the germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
so you had fun, huh?
yeah. except for, y'know when you are on a date and you are getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.
no.
(entering) hey.
what is ah, rach in her room?
oh no, she is still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
oh what?! is she going to cancel on me again?! how can she do this? does not she know it is our anniversary?
all right ah, ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. (holds up a notepad) call rachel.
what is that on the bottom?
oh that is my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. (to phoebe) she is fancy.
(answering her phone at work) hello.
hey, honey.
oh, hi.
hey, what is going on?
well, there was a disaster in shipping and I have got to get this order in. honey, I am so sorry, but it looks like I am going to be here all night.
what, do you, well umm, oh how about i come up there?
no-no-no, no, honey please, I have got, I have just have so much to deal with.
(to monica) anyway, I am going out with sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? so that when we, it is time for our alone time, you two could split off. y'know, he is really, he is kind of cute.
yeah, well kind of cute, like really kind of cute, or kind of cute like your friend spackel back larry?
hey, do not call him that! his name is spackel back harry!
hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. i mean what time did chloe say we should be there?
uh, 10:30.
what time is it now?
4:30.
yeah all right, so we will hang out.
yeah. hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
yes. vividly.
she was kidding about that right?
yeah, i-i-i think so. (pauses and thinks about it for a second) yeah, i-i think so...
god, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
yeah. yeah, i mean what, what would we do?
dude, i do not know.
she was kidding.
yeah.
she was.... but y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
yeah, for sure. okay. probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. y'know, because you do not want to be doing something and then look up and see something you do not want to be seeing.
yeah. good call, nice one. hold it!! hold it! what if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
ah!! okay! eyes open at all times! oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?
right. right. well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
yeah, i guess, but what is like heads and what is tails?
well it you do not know that, then i do not want to do this with you.
(on the phone) no, no, no, I am looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. and.... (listens) what does it matter, what I am wearing?! can i please speak to your supervisor? (listens) thank you. (to sophie) we are holding.
(entering, carrying a basket) hi!
(startled) oh!! my god, what are you doing here?

ross honey, this is very nice, but, but i-i got a crisis.
yeah, but i got cous-cous!
honey, honey, I am sorry, i know it is our anniversary but i told you on the phone i do not have time to stop.
okay, you do not have to stop, I am invisible, I am not here. (lights a candle)
but i do not, hmm... (on phone) oh, who approved that order?! (listens) well there is no mark robbinson in this office. (to sophie) get me mark on the phone!
yeah!!
well, let me just check that with what i got here, all right see 038 is not the number for (ross starts making a lot of noise with a handheld pepper grinder) this store, 038 is atlanta. and i...(stops and looks at ross)
(stopping grinding) pepper?
(angrily) none for me.
okay sorry, whew.
I am sorry, as i was saying the store number is wrong, and I am sorry but that is... (notices a fire that ross’s candle has started) oh my god!!
(putting out the fire with a squeeze bottle of water) okay, that is a fire. oh yeah. oh yeah.
(on phone) excuse me, I am sorry, I am going to have to call you back, I have got a schemp in my office. (hangs up) (to ross) what are you doing?
I am sorry. but ah, hey, oh, somebody is off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, i could get it going again.
ross you are not listening to me, i do not have time to stop.
come on rach, you do not have what, ten minutes?
i do not have ten minutes!!
what? (to sophie) sophie, does she have ten minutes?
hey, ross!!! i told you i do not!
do not yell at me okay, this is the most I have seen you all week.
look, i cannot do this right now, okay, I have got a deadline, would you just go home, I will talk to you later. (storms out)
yeah, but wait...
good bye!
hey.
hi. look um, about what happened earlier...
no, hey, well, i-i completely understand. you were, you were stressed.
(throws her stuff down) i was going to give you a chance to apologise to me.
for what? for letting you throw me out of your office?
you had no right coming down to my office ross. you do not bring a picnic basket to somebody is work! unless maybe they were a park ranger!
yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am i.
but i told you, i did not have the time!
yeah, well you never have the time. i mean, i do not feel like i even have a girlfriend anymore, rachel.
wh, ross what do you want from me? you want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
no, but it would be nice if you realised, it is just a job!
just a job!
yes.
ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I am doing something i actually care about. this is the first time in my life I am doing something that I am actually good at. i mean. if you do not get that...
no, hey, i get that, okay, i get that big time. and I am happy for ya, but I am tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! okay, i do not know what to do anymore.
well neither do i!
is this about mark?
(shocked) oh my god.
okay, it is not, it is not.
oh my god. i cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, ross, no, you are, you are, you are making this too hard.
oh I am, I am making this too hard. okay, what do you want me to do.
i do not know, i do not know. urrrgh! look, maybe we should take a break.
okay, okay, fine, you are right. let us ah, let us take a break, (goes to the door) let us cool off, okay, let us get some frozen yogart, or something.. (opens the door)
no. (ross is standing in the doorway.) a break from us.
oh, hi chloe.
and that is the only colour that comes in.
so, what are you doing here? i thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
yeah, little change in plans. ahh, we are going to break-up instead.
oh, and i can also speak a little french. voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? (mischa laughs) why? what did i say?
oh my god! no wonder i get such great service at cafe maurice.
(laughing and banging her spoon on the table) knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. um, could you please tell sergei that um, i was fascinated by what boutros boutros gali said in the new york times.
you did not say boutros boutros gali.
interesting.
okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell sergei that i really like his suit.
I am also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
monica, can i talk to you behind my menu, please. (behind the menu) what are you doing?
well, i was having a conversation.
yeah but, mischa is so interested in you, that sergei and i have not been able to say two words to each other.
what do you want me to do? just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
that would be great. thank you.
(jumping up to answer the phone) hello!
(disappointed) oh.
no! sorry, i just thought you were somebody else. hi!
yeah. well, umm.....
(on the verge of tears) yeah, I am fine.
no! really, no, please, please, that is, that is okay.
oh, yeah, I am not, I am not hungry.
oh. okay, bye.
so what are you going to do?
what can i do? one person wants to break-up, you break-up.
hey, no way! come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, do not i have to wait a while?
hey, this is not like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
yeah, tell that to my uncle lenny.
why? what happened to him?
nothing, he is just really believes in that.
oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. i just, it was awful. i told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then i told him i wanted to take a break, i do not want to take a break.
no. (grabs an eggroll) and then i called him, and he was not there.
oh, thank you that is very helpful, I am glad you came over.
hello.
hi! it is me.
hi! oh, I am so glad you called.
really? I have been thinking, this is crazy, i mean do not, do not you think we can work on this?
who is that?
nobody.
is that mark?
umm, honey, look he just came over to....
yeah! got it! (slams the phone down, and walks back to the bar.)
ah, that is okay, thanks.
look, i do not feel like dancing, i feel like having a drink. okay?
oh. (to phoebe) can i have a tissue?
oh, yeah, sure. i just hope you, hope you do not accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
well, tell him, apology accepted.
excuse me, but umm, is not he paying for your dinner?
hey, the man’s dog just died.
it will be my pleasure. (to phoebe) my guy has diplomatic coupons. your guy can not even say coupons. (they leave)
plate! yes, plate.
see, we do not need them.
yeah.
(to chloe) i like this song.
oh, no, no.
(picks up the phone and calls ross) oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. be home. be home, be home, be home. oh, you are not home.
ameri-can.
ameri-can. y'know it is a very hard language. let us do it again.
(quietly) hi!
(quietly) hi! (they both start kissing.)
monica? what time is it?
uhh, 9. (he pushes the clock into the sink.)
but it is dark out.
well that is because you always sleep to noon, silly! this is what 9 looks like.
i guess I will get washed up then. watch that sunrise. (he goes into the bathroom.)
I am really getting tired of sneaking around.
i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? y'know we would have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
all weekend? that is a whole lotta naked.
yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
ohh, I have always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey!
okay, y'know your not though. let us go. (he starts for his bedroom.)
wait! what about joey?
(entering from her room) hey, guess what I am doing this weekend! I am going to this culinary fair in new jersey.
oh weird, chandler just told us he is got a conference there!
oh now that-that-that is funny, it seems like chandler's conference could have been in connecticut or vermont.
I am not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it is a fake conference? it is a real conference.
(entering) hey.
hey!
hey.
is rachel here? i got to talk to her.
no, she is out shopping.
damn!
what is going on?
i told emily to come. and i just need to y'know, talk to rachel about it.
wait a minute! so when emily comes you are just, you are not going to see rachel anymore?
well look, I am just trying to focus on the "i get to see my wife," part, all right? and not the part that makes me do this. (he takes a big swig of pepto bismol.)
wow, so you guys are, you are never going to be in the same room together? how is that even going to work?
i have no idea. i mean… but-but i assure you i will figure it out.
does not seem like it is going to work, i mean…
(entering) hi, guys!
hi!
uh, hey!
what is going on?
we are flipping monica's mattress.
so I am thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
yeah that is better than my way.
oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
aww, man! (they go into monica's room.)
(going through the mail) oh look! a letter from my mom.
so, rach, y'know-y'know how emily's coming right?
oh yeah! i know.
(to chandler) can you hear anything?
oh yes, somebody just said, "can you hear anything?"
hey, joey's ass! what are you doing?
(holding a box) well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? well, when ross said rachel at the wedding, i figured it was going to happen again, so i hid this in here.
ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…
ooh, madlibs, mine! (grabs it.)
condoms?
you do not know how long we are going to be in here! we may have to repopulate the earth.
and condoms are the way to do that?
anyway it-it kind of-it all boils down to this, the last time i talked to emily…
(interrupting) oh my god! my dog died!
what?!
oh my god, le poo, our dog!
le poo's still alive?!
oh god, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine-(turns over the note)-teen blocks. oh. (they all come out from monica's bedroom) oh my god.
sweetie, we heard you crying. please do not cry.
it is le poo.
i know it is le poo right now, but it will get better.
(jumping on the bed) i can not believe it! we are here!
ooh, chocolates on the pillows! i love that!
oh, you should live with joey, roll-os everywhere.
come here. (he does, and they kiss.) okay, be right back.
oh yes! monica, get in here! there is a high-speed car chase on!
we are switching rooms.
(looks at what she is holding and shies away) oh dear god, they gave us glasses!
no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! i mean, if they did not change the glasses, who knows what else they did not change. (he glares at her.) come on sweetie, i just want this weekend to be perfect, i mean we can change rooms, can not we?
okay, but let us do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it is feed! (he grabs their bags and sprints out.)
hey, so uh, y'know how there is something i wanted to talk to you about?
oh yeah! (turns to face him.)
well, y'know how I am trying to work things out with emily. well, there is this one thing… okay, (rachel has her back turned to the camera, and ross is not looking at her.) here goes. i made a promise that-(they cut to the other camera and ross notices something coming out of rachel's nose)-oh hey!
what?
you are nose is bleeding!
oh god. (he hands her some tissues.) no! oh not again! (wiping her nose.) this-this happened when my grandfather died. it is ugh! sorry. (she puts her head back.) oh, okay, so I am sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
umm… (rachel blows her nose.)
sorry. sorry.
okay, i uh, i can not see you anymore.
yeah, i know. it is ridiculous! i can not see you either.
okay, great. (he grabs the remote and turns on the tv to the chase.)
half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
we are switching rooms again.
what? why?
this is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
(to chandler) excuse me, umm, can i talk to you over here for just a second?
uh-huh. (he does not take his eyes off the tv.)
chandler!
(turning to face her) yeah.
look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I am not going to let  them! and we are not a couple of suckers!
i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so i can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
okay, this one i like!
(watching tv, in fact, er is on.) nothing! it is over! dammit! this is regularly scheduled programming!
can we turn the tv off? okay? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
oh, I am sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
hey, do not blame me for wigging tonight!
oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
i do not know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas!
do not speak ill of the dead.
we are supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom.
what did you say?
i said, "geez, relax monnnnn."
hi!
hey. rachel, i-i-I have been wanting to tell you something for a while now and i really, i just have to get it out.
okay, what is up?
okay, y'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
yeah, i told you to give emily whatever she wants.
and while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…
yeah?
…is for me not to see you anymore.
that is crazy! you can not do that! what are you going to tell her? (pause) (realizes) oh god. ohh, you already agreed to this, have not you?
it is awful i know, i mean, i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work. and i do, i have to make this marriage work. i have too. but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
ohh! lucky me! oh my god! that is good news, ross! i think that is the best news I have heard since le poo died!
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been. this is so hard.
oh yeah, really? is it ross? yeah? okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
what are you doing?
storming out!
rachel, this is your apartment.
yeah, well that is how mad i am!!
damn rollos!
hey, you are back!
hey.
how was your conference?
it was terrible. i fought with (pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. are you kidding with this? (throws away another rollo)
oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator.
(entering) hi!
hey, you are back too!
yeah. umm, chandler can i talk to you outside for a second?
hey, how was your chef thing?
oh, it was awful. (to chandler) i guess some people just do not appreciate really good food.
well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
chandler! (motions for him to come outside.)
monica. (follows her out.)
okay, I would like to know how much the room was because I would like to pay my half.
okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars?!
yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
urghh!!
(sticking his head out the door) what are you guys woofing about?
chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
nooooo!!! y'know what? now that i think about it, i constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
you should have seen the look on her face. i do not want rachel to hate me! i do not know what to do.
you want my advice?
yes! please!
you are not going to like it.
that is okay.
you got married to fast.
that is not advice!
i told ya.
I am going to the bathroom. (gets up and exits.)
man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, i could not do it.
maybe i could do it.
(entering) hi!
hi, rach.
hi!
hey.
hey.
look, i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know, I have been obsessing about it all day and I would just love not to talk about it. all right?
i-i-i do not know if this falls under this category, but uh, ross is right back there. (points over his shoulder.)
that is not ross!
oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though.
okay, ross is in the bathroom.
oh my god, its happening. it is already started. I am kip.
hey, you are not kip!
(to joey) do you even know who kip is?
who cares? you are rachel! (to chandler) who is kip?
kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
oh, that poor bastard.
see? yeah, you told me the story. he and monica dated when they broke up they could not even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? he got phased out!
you are not going to be phased out!
well, of course i am! it is not going to happen to ross! he is your brother. (to chandler) he is your old college roommate. ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go.
ehh!!
honey, come on! you live far away! you are not related. you lift right out.
(entering) hey!
hey, mr. bing. that uh, hotel you stayed at called. said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
yes that was mine.
because i figured you would hooked up with some girl and she would left it there.
yes that would have made more sense.
y'know, i-i do not even feel like i know you anymore man! all right, look, I am just going to ask you this one time. and whatever you say, I will believe ya. (pause.) were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
phoebe? (she turns her head further away.) I am sorry about the whole lifting out thing. (moves over next to her.) you got to come with me!
come where?
wherever i go. come on you and me, we will-we will start a new group, we are the best ones.
okay, but try and get joey too.
(entering) pheebs, you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec?
oh, sure! (she gets up to leave.) bye ross! (whispering behind his back.) forever.
hi.
hi. what are you doing here? is not this against the rules?
i talked to monica, look, I am the one who made the choice. I am the one who is making things change, so i should be the one to y'know, step back.
oh, ross…
no, no, it is okay. really. they are plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king. so is, is that better?
no, it is not better. i still do not get to see you.
well, what-what would you do? rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
well, for starters i would have said the right name at my wedding!
i can not believe this is happening.
i know.
i am so sorry.
i know that too.
(entering) (he clears his throat to get their attention.) hey, rach? sorry to interrupt but umm, phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
(entering) hey!
hi.
i just came over to drop off…nothing. so that weekend kind of sucked, huh?
yeah, it did.
so, i guess this is over.
what?
well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
why, exactly?
because of the weekend, we had a fight.
chandler that is crazy! if you give up every time you would have a fight with someone you would never be with anyone longer than—ohhh! (they both realize something there.)
so, this is not over?
(laughs) you are so cute! no. no, it was a fight. you deal with it and move on! it is nothing to freak out about.
really? okay. great!
ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (she goes to kiss him.)
(stops her) we are in a relationship?
I am afraid so.
okay.
hey!
hey!
oh hey, monica, i heard you saw donald trump at your convention.
yeah, i saw him waiting for an elevator.
hey, rach, can i borrow your eyelash curler, i think i lost mine.
yeah, it is in there. (points to the bathroom.)
(shocked) oh! ohh! oh!!
joey, can i talk to you for a second? (he grabs him and starts to drag joey into monica's room.)
oohh!! ohh! oh-oh-oh! oh-oh!!
ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
yes. yes. (let us him up.)
(to chandler) you?! (to monica) and-and you?!
yes, but you cannot tell anyone! no one knows!
how?! when?!
it happened in london.
in london!!!
the reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a big deal out of it.
but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!
no-no-no-no-no! you can not!
please? please?! we just do not want to deal with telling everyone, okay? just promise you will not tell.
all right! man, this is unbelievable! i mean, it is great, but…
i know, it is great!
aww, i do not want to see that!
we are so stupid! do you know what is going on in there? they are trying to take joey!
the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe. and if you win, you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, "hi, phoebe!"
oh that is cute! we really all enjoyed it. but y'know, it does not count.
count for what?
count in our heads as-as good madlibs.
i guess I am done.
fun's over!
wait-wait, guys! if-if we follow the rules, it is still fun and it means something!
uh-huh!
i think I am going to take-off.
guys, rules are good! rules help control the fun! (they all leave and close the door on monica.) ohhh! (throws her notepad down in disgust.)
(watches joey for a moment) okay! (joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that he is scratching his back with it.) listen, I am going to be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
right! and when is that due?
first of the month.
and that is every month?
no, just the months you actually want to live here.
ahhh.
okay, here is the phone bill. (hands it to joey.)
(looking at it) oh my god!!
that is our phone number. now look, i know i kind of sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why do not i just—why do not i just cover you for a while?
no-no! no way! joey tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
it is not charity, joe…
no! forget it! okay—i mean thanks, but I am done taking money from you. all right, i can take of myself. now, what is next? come on.
okay uh, here is the electric bill. (hands it to him.)
this is how much we pay for electric?!!!
uh, yeah.
so, we will do the rest of the bills later then?
so is joey going to have to give up the apartment?
no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he would not take it.
well, how much do you think he needs?
i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? but i have to trick him into taking it so i will not hurt his pride.
why do not you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want.
well that would help the pride thing.
(entering from her room) hey!
hey! wow! you look great! want to move in with me tomorrow?
(thinks) okay.
okay! (they kiss) so, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with rachel we thought we would go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that rachel is moving in with phoebe.
and also, my birthday.
it is not your birthday.
what a mean thing to say! i would never tell you it is not your birthday!
hey!
hey!
hey!
hey! so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we would do nothing.
whoa-whoa-whoa, knicks season opener tonight. i thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
i do not know ross, not if you are going to talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
i did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
(entering from her room) pheebs, i was wondering…
you are not dressed yet?! we are supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
well and clearly not a minute sooner.
rachel, you are packed though right, i mean please tell me that you are packed.
of course i packed! monica relax! i just wanted to ask phoebe her opinion on what i should wear tonight.
my god, i can not get a minute of peace around this place.
oh my god! monica’s just going to kill you.
yeah, yeah, i know.
well, what you are wearing is fine for that.
(entering) rachel, i need to borrow—you are not packed!!!! you are not packed even a little bit!
surprise!!
what?
no, no do not get mad because look—this is what happened. so i-i started packing, then i realized, "what am i doing? i am lousy at packing!" right? but you love packing! so, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
(grabs a bag of those styrofoam peanuts) I will be coordinator! oh my god! I am so sorry, i did not get you anything! okay, look everybody has to help! okay? you can help, can not you phoebe?
i have plans.
you are plans were with us.
that is right.
all right, chandler can make boxes, ross can wrap, and joey can lift things. now phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
okay.
okay! (to rachel) oh my god, thank you!!
hurry! monica’s going to make you pack! she is got jobs for everyone! now, it is too late for me, but save your selves! (the guys scramble for the door.)
(entering and interrupting the guy’s escape attempt) okay! the movers will be here in 11 hours. rachel has not packed. now, everybody has to help! chandler, we are going to start with…
oh nope, i-i have plans with joey.
i thought you said you were going to do nothing.
yes, but for the last time.
okay fine, now ross…
oh, but-but i can not do it.
why not?
(quietly) I have got ben.
because, because I have got ben.
it is almost 8 of the clock, it is almost past his bedtime. where-where is he?
he is at a dinner party.
is he really coming? because i can see right into your apartment!
of course he is! what, do you think I would just use my son as-as an excuse? what kind of father do you think i am?
all right, sorry. (goes back to rachel’s room.)
(to the guys) i got to go make a fake ben.
here it is! our last pizzas together as roommates.
oh, i wish I would know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese.
oh that is okay. hey, actually in a way it is kind of nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
what, are you crazy? you have not beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. it would be easier if you just give me your money.
yes it would. what do you say to $50?
okay, you are on.
okay, let us play! the big game, italy vs. china, apparently.
ohhhhhh, look it is the roller blades.
(starting to cry) oh god!
you remember when we got these?
no.
i guess you were not there. (they hug.)
you guys, we said we were going to have fun! come on, hey, remember the time… (she starts laughing hysterically.) you do not remember?
I am sorry pheebs, i guess I am just really said that I am leaving.
I am going to miss you so much.
well, this does not have to be so sad though. y’know? maybe instead of just thinking about how much you are going to miss each other, you should like think of the things you are not going to miss.
i do not think there is anything.
come on, there is got to be something.
nope, she is perfect.
i have one.
good! great! you can go first.
uh well, i guess I am not going to miss the fact that you are never allowed to move the phone pen. (laughs. monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)
good that is a good one. okay, monica, anything? y’know? does rachel move the phone pen?
aw, sometimes. always, actually.
okay, good. there you go. does not anyone feel better?
not just the phone pen. i never get my messages.
you get your messages!
yeah, well i do not think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
so-so, you missed a message from who? chandler or your mom? or chandler? or your mom?
great! it worked! no one’s sad.
(scores) yes! i win again! ha-ha! that is like 500 bucks you owe me! whoo-ho-hoo! (goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (by the way, there is nothing in the fridge.) whoo-ho-ho! (notices the sparseness of the fridge.) i got to buy some food.
okay, give me a chance to win my money back. okay? sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
you serious?
oh yes!
okay, get ready to owe me!
okay.
okay, here we go. ready?
no! no! no! no—(joey looks at him)—one can beat me.
see? now, that is why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
hello? (listens) oh, hi ross! (to rachel) see? other people call me!
ooh, your brother. score!
(on phone) what is up?
oh, I am just over here with ben. i thought we would say hi.
oh, put him on!
ben, say hi to aunt monica. (he holds the phone to the fake ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) oh, i guess he does not feel like talking right now. he is smiling though! okay, talk to you later.
yeah, i think it was better when you guys were sad. hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
you know what else I am not going to miss? "I am monica. i wash the toilet 17 times a day. even if people are on it!"
"hi I am rachel, is my sweater too tight? no? oh, I would better wash it and shrink it!"
"I am monica, i do not get phone messages from interesting people. ever!"
hey! i call her!
"oh my god, i love ross! i hate ross! i love ross! i hate ross!"
"oh my god, i can not find a boyfriend! so i guess I will just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find in there!"
yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations. (phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)
still broken?
this sucks man! the last night you are here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack? (holds up a deck of cards.)
nah, not my game.
okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? we could play a new game. a new game, it is fun.
well, what is it called?
cups.
i do not know how to play cups.
I will teach ya! come on, come on, it is really easy and really, really fun.
all right.
okay, here you go. (he deals out two cards each.) i have two queens, what do you have?
a two and a five.
ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
really?!
oh yeah! okay, let us play again. (he deals out two cards each again.) what do you got?
a four and a nine.
you are kidding right?
no. why?
well that is a full cup! (pays him again.)
damn! i am good at cups!
I am not talking to her!
well, one of you has to take the first step! and it should be you, because she is the one who is leaving. it is harder for her!
well, maybe you are right—she made fun of my phone pen!
i know, i took it hard too.
listen rachel, i feel really bad about—what are you doing? (she sees that rachel is unpacking.)
I am unpacking!
what?!
I am not moving! (she re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) is that picture straight?
it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
hey, y’know what? you are the one who wants to make this big change and move in with chandler! you should be the one to go! why should i have to leave?!
because it is my apartment!
well it is mine too! what else you got?!
how about, you are moving!! (grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. what follows is a brief sequence of rachel unpacking and monica packing the same stuff over and over again as rachel chants "no." and monica chants "yes.")
look! this is ridiculous. we should be packing you!! (she knocks over monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)
hey, how are you guys doing?
great! monica’s moving!
(entering) i am not!
oh really?! then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (monica starts chasing rachel around the table.)
okay, you guys. you guys i think i know what is going on here. okay, you guys… stop!! (they stop.) i know that, i know that you are acting mad because you think that it will make it easier to leave. but deep down you are still really sad. deep-deep down.
no phoebe i am mad!
well, deep-deep-deep down!
yeah, I am just mad!
then keep running. (they resume the chase.)
you win.
well, what did you have?
it does not matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far?
uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.
not 700 exactly?
yeah.
double it! (he does.)
what?
well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
really?
hey, i did not make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (joey gets excited.) do not get to excited because that is not going to happen unless you get—no way! (he takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. of course, any card would have won. chandler pays him.)
well, this is the last box of your clothes. I am just going to label it, "what were you thinking?"
funny, because i was just going to go across the hall and write that on chandler.
hey you guys, i do not mean to make things worse, but umm, i do not want to live with rachel anymore.
you are just so mean to each other! and i do not want to end up like that with rachel. i still like you!
well, phoebe that is fine because I am not moving.
whoa-whoa-whoa, phoebe you got to take her! y’know i-i-i said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
oh really? like what monica?
y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…
oh yeah, good start mon.
she let us you borrow them.
yeah and you stretch ‘them out with your big old clown feet.
do you want to live outside?! because it is gettin’ cold! (to phoebe) she gets tons of catalogs and umm, she will fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I would like.
what else?
when i take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
yeah, i do. i-i do, do that.
that is nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.
when i fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
well y’know, i do not want you to be cold.
and when i told her that i was going to be moving in with chandler, she was really supportive. (to rachel) (starts to cry) you were so great. you made it so easy. and now you have to leave. and i have to live with a boy!! (they both break down in tears.)
oh, it is going to be fine.
okay rachel, i can not wait to live with you! and you know what we should do? bring monica and then we could all live there together! we will have so much fun!!
but honey, i think she is moving in with chandler.
oh that is right. you are still set on that?
kind of. (she hugs phoebe and looks out the window. she moves closer to it to get a better look.) oh my god!
(answering the phone) hello? (listens) hey mon, how is the packing going? (listens) ben? he is fine. yeah, he is right—oh my god! (he looks over at the fake ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) get your head of your shirt there son! (he tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) what? (listens) yeah, it is a pumpkin. I will come pack.
hey!
what is wrong?
ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in cups!
wh-how did you lose at cups?!
the same way you lost. i started out with a king and a queen, bamn! ross gets a 2 and a 3. then i get a jack and a king, boom! ross gets a 4 and a 5! ross was getting the cup card, the d-cup, the sittin’ down bonus! meanwhile, i did not even get half a cup! nothing!!
oh man!!
and he never played before either! y’know what i think? i think beginner’s luck, very important in cups.
all right, let us play one more hand! one more!
no, no, no more! i cannot lose another dime! I am serious this time! in-in fact, look, there is a—i want to give you something. and let me give it too you know before i pawn it for cups money. (he rolls the big white dog over) now, i want you to have the big white dog as a kind of of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
i can not take the big white dog! you love it!
it is him, not it!
no, but wait—what if i bought it from you, y’know? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (gets choked up) $1,500?
wait a second, i see what you are trying to do here! you-you are trying to give me money again!
when did i try to give you money?
over there! (points to the couch) before, with the bills! you tried to give some charity, i said "no," you dropped it. okay? then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
I am just trying to help you out! okay? i want to make sure that you are okay.
i will be okay! look chandler, you got to get it out of your head that i can not take care of myself. okay? look, I am not going to miss you helping me out with money. the only thing that I am going to miss…is you. and now the dog.
hey. call me when you get there. okay?
okay.
I am really going to miss you.
oh! i have your key. here you go. (hands it to monica.)
thanks.
yeah.
oh god! this is silly, I am going to see you in a couple of hours! (they hug again.)
yeah.
bye house!
bye mon.
bye.
(entering) hey.
she really left.
i know. (he kisses her.)
thank you.
no problem roomie. (she turns around and hugs him.)
can i ask you a question?
sure!
what the hell is that dog doing here?! (she notices the dog sitting in the living room.)
i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money.
and now you want that money back.
exactly.
chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (as he picks up the fake ben.)
it is not a real game! i made it up!
I am sorry you lost your money, but i won it fair and square.
at a fake game!!
now, if you want to try to make some of it back, I would be glad to play you for it. but i should warn you, i am very good at cups.
okay! now i assume the saucer card came up when you played last.
no.
hmm, let us see if it comes up this time. (he looks at his cards and shrugs.)
oh, the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.you want to...? (plays with her finger on chandlers chest)
you know, I would love to, but I am a little tired.
I will put a pillowcase over my head.
you are on!
hey!
what is up?
well, okay, mike's taking a shower, which by the way there is no law against. and then we are going to grab some food, so if you want...
... finally...
is that ross?
yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
sounds like he is with someone.
he could be alone. this morning i heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
wait a minute, i think phoebe's right. you know i hear someone else in there with him.
god, you are amazing... i did not even have to ask you to call me that.
oh my god, that is charlie!
she is cheating on joey with ross!
oh that tart... floozy... giant...
I am not sure about this.
yeah, you are right. this is none of our business.
no I am not sure that it is the best way to hear everything. someone get me a glass!
oh, I am not going to do this, okay? I am not going to eavesdrop on my friend.
(through wall) ooh... i love barbados!
ooh... i can not believe I am kissing you. I am kissing rachel!
i know, I am her!
(whispering) rachel and joey! it is rachel and joey!!!
what?
get over here!
ooh...
wow!
(in her monica-excited-way... too loud!) oh my god, i love how thin these walls are!
(muffled) thank you.
hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? what changed?
well, i only said that because of ross, you know. then i saw him kissing charlie...
what? ross and charlie? (joey nods) wow! she is really making her way through the group, huh? ah, who am i to talk?
i can not believe this. rachel and joey?
how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? no-one is manning that wall!
I am on it!
anything?
i think i hear curtains closing...
we have got shoes being kicked off over here.
bedsprings, unmistakable!
you do realise that is your brother?
not until you said it. somebody switch! (chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and phoebe runs to the other wall. monica returns to chandlers wall.) wait a minute... ross and charlie, joey and rachel, phoebe and mike! we are the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
that is not true. i came with monica and I am leaving with weird al.
okay, I have had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning, before we leave, I am going to the salon.
okay buckwheat!
you got to hear this, it is great... it is like free porn! (chandler eagerly rushes over)
weh...*sigh*
yeah, it is just... i do not think i can do this...
no, no! (they are moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) look, i need to talk to joey. i mean, you guys just broke up. before anything more happens between us, i need to know he is okay with it.
alright, I am going to go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) i just need a... need a before i can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) okay, i see you later.
that is the door. he is gone...
and she is... turning on the tv... and watching... miss congeniality!
honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
hey, what are you guys doing?
oh, we are just... we are sad to go so we are just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) i love you... paradise hotel, golf resort and spa... (she walks away from the wall)
(also hugs the wall) yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to phoebe)
(caresses the wall with his finger) bye!
okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere?
he is probably in his room with his current girlfriend charlie. that is the situation as we know it... (walks to phoebe and monica)
well, if you see him could you please tell him I am looking for him?
you got it!
thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) thank you! (closes the door)
other wall, people! other wall!
(knocks on door) rach, you there? (joey and rachel both get up from the bed)
oh my god, it is ross. what are we going to do?
oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. just be calm. for all he knows we are just hanging out together. right? just be nonchalant. (joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) that is not nonchalant!
no idea what it means.
oh... okay, just hide!
(knocks) rach?
coming! try under the bed, try under the bed!
there is no room under the bed. (looks around because she can not find joey anymore)
is everything okay?
yeah... (still looking to see where joey went, and opens the door)
hey.
hi...
you know where joey is?
...i really do not... (looks around again)
can i talk to you for a minute?
yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if joey is there)
i do not believe this... have you guys been...
shhh... this is the listening side of the wall.
and then she told me that she and joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
(clearly not listening and still trying to find out where joey went) uh-huh... right... yeah...
and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her.
(still searching) oh, i know... i know it is been really hard for you.
anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. i mean, how angry do you think joey is going to be?
(now looking up at the ceiling) that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say.
you know, i got to go find him. he is got to be here someplace.
you would think!
joey!
is he gone?
(still can not find him) how are you doing this?
pssst...
how... wha... hey! what are you... what is this? have you guys been listening this entire time?
now, what is this?
ah, what is this? well, let us see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we are talking to our friends about it, so i guess this is sixth grade!
oh no... have you thought about it how complicated this could get? what about ross?
well, he is with charlie now.
yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. and as his friend, i mean, do not you think he deserves the same from you?
(long pause and he twitches a bit) you are a pain in my ass, geller!
all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it...
okay, well we will go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? the people that care about you?
sure...
enunciate!
get out!
are they right?
probably, yeah... i mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to ross.
yeah... yeah, we can wait, we do not have to do anything tonight.
yeah, i think that would be best... so, so I am going to... I am going to take off...
(joey walks to the door) although...
(turns around very fast) i like although!
i mean, you know... ross and i have not dated in like... six years...
six years? wow... it is almost as long as highschool...
plus, you know, he is with charlie now.
absolutely! he is not thinking about you.
no...
I am thinking about you...
yeah...
let us forget about ross...
forgotten.
what is wrong?
nothing...
nothing... it is really... it is nothing... come here, come here...
sorry, i just uhm... i can not seem to get ross out of my head...
well, maybe i can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... ross in rachel's dress! he realises it too late, and when he does, pushes ross's/rachel's head away)
yeah... we really need to talk to ross...
hey!
hey!
you guys ready to go?
not quite. monica's still at the salon, and I am just finishing packing.
dude! you are not taking your bible?
you are not supposed to take that. besides, it is a new testament, what are you going to do with it?
learn about jesus...
hey!
uh, no... no. i could not find him. I am just going to talk to him on the plane.
stop it!
you are filthy!
hey, have you guys seen monica?
uh, actually i think she went to the salon.
oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
check it out!
who is day just got better? chandler!
hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
what do you think?
i think.... i think i can see your scalp.
do not you just love it?
ye... yeah... yeah... you got shellfish in your head.
you have never said that in your life, have you?
i thought so.
and listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)
what d'ya know... it is a treat for the eyes and the ears.
whoo, whoo. wow, it is uhm... kind of weird that I am sitting next to charlie after we broke up.
yeah, it is almost if air barbados does not care about your social life.
look, does someone mind switching to sit with charlie?
oh, i uh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference with charlie.
i understand...
no, I will do it. (he quickly grabs joey's boarding pass and gives joey his one.)
wish i could switch with someone. i really do not want to sit with allen iverson over there.
uhm... you know, once we are in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
aaah... you are not good at this...
no, i think i can come over. it is saturday, right?
what?
why not?
you have a... you have a date? with who?
(let us go of his hand) you have... have a girlfriend?
for how long?
three months? okay... this is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you are going to keep seeing her?
oh, okay... good. you do that. and then when you get home, maybe there will be a special delivery package waiting for you.
you know what, we are going to have sex. let us just leave it there.
right, I am going to go talk to joey. i think this is the right time. he is always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
ross is coming over. i think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
i guess so. I am just... really nervous.
okay, well keep in mind that by the time you are done, they will probably be serving dinner.
ooh...
still nervous?
I am going to get the lasagna.
hey rach...
yeah!
do you mind if i sit here for a sec.?
yeah, yeah sure! yeah! (mouths "good luck" to joey and gets up from her seat)
hey!
hey!
so, i uhm... kind of need to talk to you about charlie.
yeah?
okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... well, charlie and i were talking, and..., well...
you kissed.
wha... (gasps) what? what would give you that idea?
i saw you.
yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
ross, ross, ross... it is okay.
what?
it is okay. you know, i totally understand, alright? you guys, make way more sense than her and i ever did, you know. and... i want you to be happy.
are you serious?
yeah... now i have something...
i am speachless... i mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. i mean, you are an incredible friend, you know that?
oh... uh... look... before you...
no, i mean it. you are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
i am those things, yeah.
you know what? i know chandler longer, so i always think of him as my best friend, but now... i may have to rethink some stuff...
dude!
hey, if there is ever, anything i can do for you...
i can not think of anything.
thanks!
yeah.
so hi!
hi!
so you eh, you talked to joey?
ah, yeah. we had a really good talk.
oh! that is great!
yeah!
oh, so everything's okay?
oh, no, it is great. it is great. he is... he is an amazing guy.
ah... well, obviously i think so too.
well, I am so excited about this.
really? excited?
are you kidding? i have had some very dirty dreams about this...
excuse me! (and she walks back to joey, who is still looking very impressed about what ross said to him. rachel looks at him and hits him.) you did not tell him, did you?
i could not. he was saying all these really nice things about me. i did not want him to get mad and take  them all back. I am on a edge on chandler.
oh god! alright, fine. you know what joey, forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him.
thank you. yeah, i appreciate that.
hi, mike's place.
ooh, that was fast.
yeah, you can not do that! oh, come on mike, strap on a pair.why do not you just tell her that we got back together. you know, women appreciate honesty. we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. just f.y.i.
her name is precious? is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)
(stunned) i... I am phoebe.
enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)
oh, i can not wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) ow!
you go back to work tomorrow night, right?
yeah!
so if you want people to see them, then by definition you are not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
well, if i had them taken out, then i would not be able to do this. (she pushes chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against chandler's chest) you like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)
what are you singing?
it is "bolero" from "10".
it is "ride of the valkyries" from "apocalypse now"... see, here is the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. and now that we are home, we do not have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... i hate them!
you what? you said you liked them.
did i? let us refresh. i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.
fine, so you do not like them. everybody else does.
again, let us journey back... as i recall what rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey... well, joey did not realise that there was anything different.
you know what? i do not care. i like it like this, and I am going to keep it. you are just jealous because your hair can not do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) ouch!
hit yourself in the tooth?
and the eye!
(gasps) hi... there she is. hi emma. oh my god, i missed you. (kisses her) oh emma, i missed you so much. hey... did you have a good time with grandma green? huh? did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to rachel)
that was one time, ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
ooh hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? okay? i want you to wait right here. come here sweetie.
aaah... ross, actually there is something that i really need to talk to you about.
(unpacking his bag) okay, shoot!
okay, uhm... alright, here is the deal.
(gasps) oh no!
what? what is it?
oh, major shampoo explosion!
uh, look ross, this really is not easy.
oh, it is all over everything. why? why me? (looks up)
because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
I am sorry, I am sorry. you were saying?
well, yeah... okay, look it is about me and...
oh, not another one! oh my g... and this is moisturiser. it is even harder to clean! why? why do bad things happen to good people?
wow! well, clearly this is not a good time.
duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)
okay, bye. alright, so mike's on his way over. see, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... does not really matter who is right or wrong. point is... I am going to take off.
alright... susie, can i call you susie?
yeah, i can not say that. uhm... susie, I am going to be straight with you... mike and i are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. and he is very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
well, i do not...
nothing, there is nothing wrong with you.
damn it woman, pull yourself together! have some pride, for the love of god.
okay, not a fan of the tough love.
but he did not really know, you know. he was not planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me...
look, precious... mike's not worth this. you are an attractive, intelligent woman and let us face it, mike's kind of a wang. i mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... he was going to break-up with you on your birthday? and, i do not like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
you are welcome!
honey, you have been in there for a long time... is everything okay?
not really.
i have a problem.
really? what happened?
well, i was dancing around, and singing "no woman, no cry" and i got stuck.
you can not move at all?
oh, well, i can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)
if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
(looking disappointed) i guess so...
(trying to untangle her) some of these look a little frayed.
yeah, i tried to gnaw myself free.
hey!
hi!
so, did you err... did you tell ross?
well, i tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. so i guess now it is your turn again.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... i think it is better if you tell him, you know. it is easier for a woman. that way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... i did not mean it. I am so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)
yeah, because that is what we do.
alright, alright, okay, uhm... how 'bout this, how about this? tomorrow... tomorrow we will both go and we will tell him together.
okay, that sounds fair. it just means that once again we can not...
i know, i know..., but that is okay. i mean, we can control ourselves, we are not animals.
no! of course we can wait. alright, so i guess that means good night then?
yeah! good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)
goo--ood night!
good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)
seriously, good night!
stop saying good night.
okay.
look what i found in the drawer... (chandler looks up from his book.) and you said I would never wear this...
now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
sure, what do you have in mind?
i think you know.
really? i do not really feel like it.
this is what i want to do.
okay, i just do not get why you like it so much.
(picks up the "miss congeniality" dvd) she is an fbi agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
okay, okay, i checked. we have: earl grey, english breakfast, cinnamon stick, camomile, mint medley, blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there is one more, um.. lemon soother. you are not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? (guy shakes his head) okay.
mail call, rachel green, bunk seven.
thank you. (examines it) oh, cool! free sample of coffee!
oh good! because where else would we get any?
oh. right. ...oh great.
what is it?
country club newsletter. my mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' oh my god! oh my god, it is barry and mindy!
barry who you almost...?
barry who i almost.
and mindy, your maid of...?
mindy, my maid of. oh!
(takes it) that is mindy? wow, she is pretty. (sees rachel's look) lucky. to have had a friend like you.
marcel. bring me the rice, c'mon. bring me the rice, c'mon. good boy. good boy. c'mere, give me the rice. (marcel brings the rice) thank you, good boy. well, i see he is finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. (rachel ignores him) 'bring me the' and- rach?
what?
hi.
oh, I am sorry. oh, this is so stupid! i mean, i gave barry up, right? i should be happy for them! i am, I am happy for them.
really.
no. oh, oh, i guess it would be different if i were- with somebody.
whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'forget relationships! I am done with men!' the whole, uh, penis embargo?
oh, i do not know. i guess it is not about no guys, it is about the right guy, y'know? i mean, with barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. with paolo, that is all there was, was heat! and it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
wait-wait. i, i got it. i was there.
well, i mean, do you think you can ever have both? y'know? someone who is like, who is like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
yes. yes. yes! yes, i really do! in fact, it is funny, very often, someone who you would not think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
hi.
...gets interrupted. hi!
hi, how was the movie?
wonderful!
so good!
suck-fest.
toootal chick-flick.
i-I am sorry it was not one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
hey, i do not need violence to enjoy a movie. just so long as there is a little nudity.
there was nudity!
i meant female nudity. alright? i do not need to see lou grant frolicking.
alright, I have got to go. c'mon, marcel! c'mon! we are going to go take a bath. yes we are, are not we? yes, we are.
they are still just friends, right?
(to marcel) and i will see you tomorrow!
that is right, you are going to spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's, are not you.
oh, hang on, hang on. does aunt monica get a say in this?
'pwease, aunt monica, pwease?' oh, unclench. you are not even going to be there.
i can not believe we are even having this discussion.
i agree. I am, like, in disbelief.
i mean, do not you think if things were going to happen with rachel, they would have happened already?
I am telling you, she said she is looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
she really said that?
well, i added the 'exactly like me' part... but she said she is looking for someone, and someone is going to be there tonight.
'tonight' tonight?
well, i think it is perfect. y'know, it is just going to be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
i can not remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey.
anyway, i figured after work I would go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
now, now the one in the feather boa, that is dr. francis. now, she used to be a man. okay, now look, see, there is raven. we hate her. we are glad she is dying. okay- (marcel pushes down a cushion to reveal a shoe) wh- wh- marcel, are you playing with monica's shoes? you know you are not supposed to pl- whoah. marcel, did you poo in the shoe? (takes the shoe into the kitchen) marcel, bad monkey! oh! oh! (she notices the newsletter and taps the contents of the shoes onto it, then folds it shut) sorry, barry. little engagement gift. I am sure you did not register for that. (she leaves the apartment holding the newsletter at arm's length. however, she leaves the door open. marcel runs out in the opposite direction. there is a shot from the tv and rachel runs back in) who died? who died? roll him over! oh, c'mon, roll him over! oh...! well, we know it was not dexter, right marcel? because- (looks down and notices he is missing) marcel? marc- (notices the open door)
how could you lose him?
i do not know. we were watching tv, and then he pooped in monica's shoe-
wait. he pooped in my shoe? which one?
i do not know. the left one.
which ones?
oh. oh, those little clunky amish things you think go with everything.
(entering) hey.
whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
rachel lost marcel.
oh no, how?
he- he pooped in my shoe.
which one?
those cute little black ones i wear all the time.
no, which one? the right or left? because the left one is lucky...
c'mon, you guys, what are we going to do, what are we going to do?
alright alright. you are a monkey. you are loose in the city. where do you go?
okay, it is his first time out, so he is probably going to want to do some of the touristy things. I will go to cats, you go to the russian tea room.
oh, my, god, c'mon, you guys! he is going to be home any minute! he is going to kill me!
okay, we will start with the building. you guys take the first and second floor, phoebe and I will take third and fourth.
well, what'm i going to do? what'm i going to do?
okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. spray lysol in my shoe, and wait for ross to kill you.
anybody want to trade? oh...
mr. heckles, our friend lost a monkey. have you seen it?
no!
why would you leave your belgian waffle in the hall?
a monkey. have you seen a monkey?
okay, thank you, mr. heckles. (they move off)
(on the phone) okay, he is a, he is a black capuchian monkey with a white face... (enter ross) ...with, with russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. okay. thanks.
hey. how did, uh, how did it go today?
great! it went great. really great. hey, is that wine?
yeah. you, uh, you want some?
oh, i would love some. but y'know what? y'know what? let us not drink it here. I am feeling kind of crazy. you want to go to newark?
uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the north-east, i was, uh, kind of wanting to run something by you. y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? (uncorks the wine) well-
oh god, ross, i cannot do this.
okay, quick and painful. (starts to cork the wine)
oh god... okay. alright. alright. okay. ross, please do not hate me.
oh, what? what-what?
y'know marcel?
...yeah?
well, i kind of... i kind of lost him.
(angry) i- i- i ca- i can not believe this. i mean, all i asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
i know, i know, I am sorry-
no, y'know what, i guess it is partially my fault. y'know, i should not have, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. i should have started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
(tearfully) ross, I am doing everything that i can, I have got everybody looking for him, and i- (door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) oh! who is it?
see? I have even called animal control!
you called animal control?
uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I am not allowed to have him in the city. if they find him, they will take him away from me.
of-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
that is right, i.. because i did not expect you were going to invite them to the apartment!
hi, thanks for coming.
oh, y'know what? that was a complete misunderstanding! (ross puts his arms around her and they act all sweetness and light)
yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we did not.
turned out it was a hat.
cat!
cat! what'm i saying? cat!
hi. we checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen marcel.
my uncle marcel.
oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
oh my god. you would put that poor little creature in jail?
pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
yes, but there is not always time!
look. I am sure there is some friendly way to reconcile this! um, have a seat. first of all, we have not been introduced, I am monica geller.
yeah!
luisa? oh my god! monica! it is luisa!
the luisa from home room!
yes!!
no, none at all.
none.
oh, I am- I am so sorry!
what?!
be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? y'know, just for old times' sake? go bobcats?
dun-dun-duuuur! sorry.
marcel?
marcel?
marcel?
marcel?
um, we are kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
a monkey.
yes have you seen any?
um, sure! did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
oh. then, no.
oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
uh, are not we kind of in the middle of something here?
yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! and they are very hot.
we can not, alright? (to the women) we are sorry. you have no idea how sorry, but... we promised we would find this monkey. if you see him, he is about yea high and answers to the name marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you would really be helping us out.
okay, from now on, you do not get to talk to other people.
marcel?
marcel?!
marcel?
marcel?
marcel?
oh-my-god!
whaaat!
something just brushed up against my right leg!
what is it?
oh, it is okay, it was just my left leg.
look, phoebe!
yeah! oh, c'mere, marcel! oh, marcel, c'mere!
what are you going to do?
run, marcel, run! run, marcel! (marcel runs off and luisa runs after him. monica goes to check up on phoebe) are you okay?
yeah, think so. oh! (she notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) huh. (sways back) whoah.
oh gosh.
marcel?
marcel?
marc- oh, this is ridiculous! we have been all over the neighbourhood. he is gone, he is-he is just gone.
ross, you do not know that.
oh come on. it is cold, it is dark, he does not know the village. (kicks a sign in frustration) and now i have a broken foot. i have no monkey, and a broken foot! thank you very much.
ross, i said I am sorry like a million times. what do you want me to do? you want me to break my foot too? okay, I am going to break my foot, right here. (kicks the sign) ow!! oh! oh my god, oh my god! there, are you happy now?!
yeah, yeah. y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! i do not miss marcel any more!
y'know, it is not like i did this on purpose.
oh, no no no. nono, this is just vintage rachel. i mean, things just sort of happen around you. i mean, you are off in rachel-land, doing your rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
ross.
i do not even want to hear it, you are just...
ross.
oh, forget it, okay?
ross!
what? what?
oh, this is so intense. one side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
hi, did you order some bananas?
give me back my monkey.
then what is with all the bananas?
marcel? marcel? okay, where is he? where is he? marcel? marcel?
marcel! what have you done to him?
are you insane? c'mere, marcel, c'mon. (marcel starts to go to him)
c'mere, marcel. (turns to ross)
okay, give me my monkey back.
alright, i want my monkey.
oh, c'mon, luisa!
(to rachel) you had to be a bitch in high school, you could not have been fat.
alright. in high school i was the prom queen and i was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! but if you take this monkey, i will lose one of the most important people in my life. you can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. c'mon, luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! take it!
alright. well then how about i call your supervisor, and i tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
it will be nice to get this off finally, will not it? yes it will. (marcel resists) or we can leave it on for now, that is fine.
y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
listen, I am- I am sorry i was so hard on you before, it is just i...
oh, ross, c'mon. it is my fault, i almost lost your...
yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? you, you were great. ...hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. you in the mood for, uh, something grape?
that would be good.
alright. (he goes to get the glasses. then he hesitates and turns off the main light. rachel looks round and he acts surprised) the, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (he sits down and starts to pour the wine) well, so long as we are here and, uh, not on the subject, i was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, i was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
barry?!
we have got to start locking that door!
this is me in the sound of music. see the von trapp kids?
nope.
that is because I am in front of them.
eh. i thought that was an alp.
well, high school was not my favourite time.
i dunno, i loved high school. y'know? it was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
yeah, well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys. any sex i had would have involved a major lifestyle choice.
gosh, does not it seem like a million years ago?
oh. oooh! ooh! ooh! (she stands up and starts to dance around) ooh! my butt cheek is waking up! oooh! ooh!
all right! (checking his watch) yes!! from home to the hospital in under seven minutes! we did it!!
(deadpan) yes, the hard part is truly over.
no, but come on, we are off to a great start are not we? i knew I would get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
oh you made it!
hi! (ross is stunned.)
how are you doing?
wait a minute! how-how the hell did you beat us here?
we took a cab. did you guys walk?
n… no! we took a cab too, but i did test runs!
hi!
hey! you made it!
okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
ross, you stay here and talk, I am going to go have a baby.
okay. okay. (to the nurse behind the desk.) umm hi, this is rachel green. I am ross geller. we-we called from the car.
(interrupting her) whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I am sorry, semi-private? we (laughs), we asked for a private room.
man, if only you would gotten here sooner. (ross turns and glares at him.)
okay. just give us a second. ross! (they walk away from the desk.)
yeah?
give her some money.
i really think they are out of rooms.
they are not!! ross, they are just saving them for the important people!! okay?! what-what if i was the president?!
well then we would be in a lot of trouble, you do not know where any countries are. (rachel glares at him.) okay. (he goes over to the desk followed by rachel.) uh, say would you umm… would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have (handing her some money) opened up?
(standing up) okay. y’know what? I would have to say i really do not care for your tone. and this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—whoa! (she starts a contraction) oh gosh! whoa!
what-what?
ow! ow! contraction. (sits back down.) ow-ow! ow-ow! (starts breathing heavily.)
yeah, it could not hurt to look.
oh, okay.
thank you.
thank you. (dr. long exits.) well, i guess we have some time to kill.
yeah, guess so. whew! check these out! (he is looking at the stirrups on the other bed in the room and rachel groans. ross then hops into the bed and puts his legs into the stirrups.) never done this before.
yeah well it looks great!
hi! hi, I am uh ross. I am here to ruin this magical day for you.
hi julie.
this is rachel. (points at her.)
hi!
how are you?
yeah it is.
that is so sweet.
yeah.
oh.
umm say, i-i opened this earlier (the privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
oh, okay.
oh no, i really do not want any—(he takes the picture)—oh! thank you. oh. oh ross…
what?
here comes another contraction.
oh. okay, just breathe.
(looking at the clock) oh wow, three hours and still no baby. ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
hey, you want to see something?
sure! what?
umm, this is going to be fun. watch me freak out chandler. honey?
yeah?
listen uh, i-I have been doing some thinking, and i do not know whether it is because we are here or rachel’s giving birth but umm, i think we should try to have a baby.
okay.
(freaking out) what-what-what is that now?!
okay. I have been thinking about it too, and i, i think we are ready.
what?! are you kidding me?! you-you-you think we are ready to have a baby now?!
oh, this is fun.
you are ready to have a baby? my boy’s all grown up!
but you said you were ready too.
yeah but i was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
yes, but have not you wanted a kid like forever?
okay, just back off mister! whoa. (pause) ‘because i am ready to have a baby. i just want joey to be the father.
(voice all high and weird) what?! are you crazy?!
that is it! right there! is all i wanted!
oh, that is very—really very-very okay.
(simultaneously as ross) no, i do not think we will be doing that.
(simultaneously as rachel) we are not going to do that.
uh yes! thank you.
oh. oh wait no.
later.
no-no-do not! do not leave me here with these people.
oh uh, I am sorry. (runs out.)
no ross! ross! ross! my child has no father!
hi! I am so glad you are here, but it is going to be a while. i-i wished you would called first.
oh good.
okay, what is up?
ma, you are asking me to marry you?
mom no, come on! thank you.
n-no! okay? we have been through this! we are not going to get married just because she is pregnant, okay?
mom, y’know what? i-i can not deal with this right now. I am sorry…
gimmie! (takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as rachel enters the hallway.)
hi!
oh, thank you so much for coming. ross, get in here!
…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I am not with rachel.
yeah. (pause) why are not you with rachel?
are you kidding? look, we are not going to be together just because we are having a baby. okay?
but y’know what? it just seems that you two belong together.
okay, stop it! i can not deal with this right now. i have to go have a baby.
right. and with who again? (ross exits.)
god. he is crazy! why does not he want to be with rachel?
i know!
i mean seriously, she is like the perfect woman. i mean i know she turned me down, but if she had not and wanted to be with me, i would take her in my arms and… (realizes everyone is staring.) i have not bummed you guys out like this in a while have i?
(to rachel) hey. who is that?
new people.
what happened to the disgustingtons?
they are having their baby! it is not fair ross we got here first! right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little jamie just crowning away.
wow! sorry. so uh, how are the new people?
well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. oh god oh! contraction!
yeah? okay.
ooh! ow!!
umm. umm, I am-I am just going to—(closes the privacy screen.)
no-no, I am…I am sure no one was looking. just want some privacy. (he closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at rachel.)
just ignore them.
ross.
what? what?
he is looking at me.
(to him) hey! you want to live to see your baby?!
oh good god! if you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
what is going on with you? since when are you so crazy about babies?
I am not crazy about babies. I am crazy about us.
what?
look, we have always talked about having babies someday. I am not saying it has to be right now, but I am starting to think that we can handle it. we are good. we are really good.
we are pretty good.
but nothing has to happen until your ready.
well maybe I am ready now. i mean, it is a little scary, but maybe it is right.
what?! it is not right! we are not ready to have a kid now!!
what?!!
I am kidding. this is going to be fun.
so we are going to try? i mean, are we trying?
we are trying to get pregnant. (they start kissing, but chandler stops it.) y’know I am not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. so, when do you want to start trying?
okay, hold on a sec.
period math?
yeah.
yeah.
well, we could start trying. now.
right here?
no, not here. maybe here.
wait a minute, it is perfect. we got a lot of time to kill and we are in a building that is full of beds!
and it is so clean!!
come on you stupid machine! come on!
oh, it ate your money?
(looking at her) no.
all right, I will see you downstairs then.
all right.
all right.
hey i got one! i got one!
hi.
oh down please. (the guy tries to reach the button, but can not.) i-i hate to be a ball buster can i just do it? (she pushes the button.)
sure! i feel so bad for you; i broke my leg once too.
well, it is a long story. it is kind of embarrassing. let us just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (the guy laughs.) how about you?
oh.
uh-huh, yeah.
oh yeah! i-i would like that.
wait! what?! no!! elevator!! no!
(standing behind her) uh, you got to press the button. (does so.)
the nurse said they are bringing in another woman.
ugh, is she pregnant yet? she does not need to be; she will still have the baby before i do. oh ross, another contraction! (leans back on ross for some support.)
that is it. that is it.
yeah it was.
(to the nurse) excuse me? could you help me with something? the patient I am looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. and umm, he is like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
oh yay! great! okay, what room number is he in?
(walks up) uh, she is with me. (introduces himself) dr. drake remoray.
remoray. it is portuguese. we need that information; I am a doctor.
damnit woman we are losing precious time! now do you want this man’s blood on your head?
hands.
hands! it is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. he is a patient of mine, I have been treating him for years!
816, thank you!
thank you. (starts to exit.)
and what is his name?
(coming back for joey) no! (grabs joey and drags him away.)
i think we found a place.
okay. (they start kissing.)
umm, wait! do you want to set the mood a little?
okay. uh, we will dim the lights, dim the lights. (he goes to the light switch and finds it is not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) or turn them out all together. uh, no scented candles. okay here. here we go. (he sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)
okay! okay! make me sterile, but okay.
okay. let us hurry—oh wait! do we have a condom? (he looks at her.) oh right! (laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)
yes, 98.6. you are going to be fine.
ooh, this is it! (looks in the window.) oh, that is him! that is him!
great! go get him.
wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
(looks in the window) he is not really my type.
no not you, dr. drake remoray. you can ask him questions and see what is he like. people tell doctors everything.
but you said he was this great guy!
but lately all the guys i meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
you do attract some stinkers.
dr. long, I have been at this for seventeen hours! three women have come and gone with their babies, you got to give me some good news! how many centimeters am i dilated? eight? nine?
just three?! I am dilated three!
hey, y’know what? I am not waiting! I am going to push this baby out! I am doing it! i mean it is what? three centimeters? that is got to be like this! (holds her hands a couple inches apart.)
actually it is more like this. (pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)
oh stupid metric system!
oh for the love of god!
oh come on!!
hi! I am dr. drake remoray and i have a few routine questions i need to ask you.
i know, but I am a neurologist. and just to be on the safe side, dr. wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
that was a test. good response. all right, full name.
date of birth?
age?
I am a doctor cliff, not a mathematician.
okay. and uh, are you married.
oh really? so, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
(checking the list) yes.
oh that is terrible. I am-I am really sorry.
hmm. do you sleep with women and never call them again?
excellent! excellent! and uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?
oooh, wrong answer. (exits.)
okay! okay wait! you listen to me! you listen to me! since i have been waiting four women, that is four, one higher than the number of centimeters that i am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I am next! it is my turn! it is only fair! and if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I am going to sue you! not this hospital, I am going to sue you! and my husband (points at ross) he is a lawyer!
uh rach…
go get back on that case honey!
okay, well then bring her in.
and yet somehow it is true!
(to rachel) squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
(softly) really?
oh!
oh there you go!
i get it!
oh we-we did not.
no-no. we…
um uh…we are-we are just having this baby together but uh, uh that is all.
uh well umm…we are just not in that place, y’know? but we are very excited about this.
just tell me how.
sid you lucky deaf bastard.
what else? what else?
uh, well he is 33.
oh. ah-uh.
a widower.
oh.
he seemed like a stand up guy. oh, and he is not into anything weird sexually.
enter pheebs.
should we tell rachel there is an empty private room right next door to hers?
we could, or we can have sex in it.
well let me think about that, while i remove my pants!
(lying down on the bed) okay mister! fertilize me!
does that sound like janice?
if it is not, then there is two of them. and that would mean it is the end of the world!
hey!
hey!
hi.
oh hi.
i can not believe this is taking so long. how are you doing?
oh not bad. do you know that feeling when you are trying to blow a saint bernard out your ass?
weirdest thing. did i hear—(a nurse opens the privacy screen and chandler sees janice)—mother of god it is true!
jan-janice!
not just janice, janice in labor, contracting and everything.
janice i did not even know you were pregnant! who is the unwitting human who is essence you have stolen?
what?!
that is funny. does it-does it hurt? does the labor hurt?
okay I have got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
somebody went to college. wow. (cliff gets uncomfortable) what is it? I am sorry. (she moves her arm, which was resting on the same pillow his leg is.)
oh, I will get it. (she gets up and grabs a spoon.)
relax, it is not like we are forking.
oh that is five ross. five women have had five babies! and i have had no babies! why does not she want to come out?
y’know what i think it is? i think you have made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just does not want to leave.
oh. look at you making up crap for me. oh god! (starts another contraction as dr. long enters.)
doctor you got to do something! i think you got to give me drugs or you got to light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
what?
my god. okay. (another woman enters.) ha-ha-ha beat ya! sucker!
y’know what? this one is. (eats another spoonful of pudding as cliff sees something on tv.)
huh. okay, mr. perkazet.
cliff, do you really believe that a character from a tv show was here in your room?
(entering) rachel’s having her baby!! (phoebe turns and looks at him.) which is of no interest to me, I am a neurologist.
okay. okay. i—okay umm…this…i-i sent my friend joey in here to find out stuff about you. umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. a lot better than I am coming off right now.
fake? excuse me? hello? (taps the tv screen.)
you are right, that was wrong. I am sorry. I am so sorry. it is just that i liked you so much. can we just, can we just start over?
uh, if i may? umm-umm look, cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? and maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. oh! oh! her-her twin sister used to do porn!
uh joey, we are trying to dial down the crazy.
right!
umm, look we do not, we do not really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. and i do not know about you but that does not happen to me a lot.
me neither.
3-2-1 oh!!
i can not. i can not push anymore, i can not.
sweetie you are doing great.
oh god twenty seconds my ass!!
what? you do? you do? (looks) oh my god!
do not say, "oh my god!" oh my god what?
what is that?
oh thank god, i thought she had two heads.
oh god. is she going to be okay?
go!
I am sorry, i can not!
yes you can!
i can not!
hey! hey! come on! you can! i know you can do this! let us go!
i can not. please, you do it for me.
no! come on let us—one more time! one final push! ready? 1…2…3! (rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting ross and knocking him down.)
(from the floor) keep pushing!
are you okay?
you have no idea how much this hurts. (all of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) keep going! keep going!
oh! oh! she is upside down but she is coming! she is coming!
oh god!
oh! oh my god oh! oh my god she is here.
oh she is…she is perfect.
oh, she is so tiny. (starts crying) where did she go?
oh it is okay. they are just-they are just wrapping her up.
okay. well be careful with her, she is really tiny.
oh hey you. thanks for coming out of me. (the baby cries.) i know. oh. yeah. oh, she is looking at me. hi! i know you.
no, not yet.
oh no, baby girl geller-green.
hello baby girl.
can we come in?
oh, come in.
hi!
there she is!
oh, she is so beautiful.
here. (hands her to monica.)
oh my god! she is amazing. oh, oh I am so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
it is incredible, i mean one minute she is inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
(taking the baby) she looks so real! (the gang looks at him.) y’know what i mean! she is this whole tiny little person. she already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.
what?
oh no-no, no for i second there i counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we are good.
okay, my turn. my turn. (joey hands her to phoebe.) oh! you are so cute! oh, i could squeeze your little head! (pause) i will not.
what is the matter?
oh nothing i… sorry, i just can not stop crying.
the doctor says it is completely normal with all the hormones. plus, you-you are sleep deprived.
so? you guys are all sleep deprived. i do not see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. oh god. (starts to cry harder.)
what is the matter now?
i was reliving it.
ohhh. (hands her back to rachel.)
so, do you know what you are going to call her yet?
oh, wait a minute it is not going to be baby girl? i thought that was so original!
uh actually, we-we have narrowed it down to two names.
yeah, and y’know what? i love them both, so why do not you just pick one and that will be it.
wow! umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is isabella. (rachel starts crying.) what?
that is not her name! I am sorry, she just does not feel like an isabella.
so then i guess ferdinad is out.
what was the other one ross?
umm, delilah.
oh great! suddenly she sounds like a biblical who are.
so i guess we are back to uh, baby girl.
yay!
well what are we going to do?
it is okay honey, you will find a name.
ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
you do?
yeah, I have had them picked out since i was fourteen.
oh no, it is going to be named after some snack or baked good is not it?
well tell us! what are they?
umm, okay. if it is a boy it is daniel.
and if it is a girl?
i do not want to say.
oh, just tell us! we are not going to want it!
okay. it is emma.
(gasps) emma! (looks at the baby and starts to cry.) see? i do not want it.
take it.
what?
it is clearly an emma.
oh honey, but you love that name.
yeah, but i love you more. besides y’know, nothing goes with bing. so I am screwed. i mean… (rachel hands emma to monica.) oh, hi emma. yeah, that is you. you are our little them. oh what is that honey? what? oh, you want a little cousin? (to chandler) you want a cousin right now?!
that was amazing.
i know. hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? we may have just started a family. nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
and if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
ohhh! (looks at aaron and recoils in horror.) wow! he kind of takes your breath away does not he?
oh, I am fine. (gasps in pain as she sits down.)
oh, I am not doing it alone. i have ross.
well then he gets a divorce, it is ross!
well i—that is never going to happen with ross.
really?
well… that is…y’know—that is—we have been alone for the last twenty minutes we are doing okay. besides y’know what? i-i—maybe we will not be alone, ‘because lately i-i—things have been happening between me and ross, y’know? right before i went into labor, we-we had this kiss. y’know? so it might be the…the beginning of something.
(entering) hey janice!
who is this little guy? (gasps when he sees aaron.)
no-no. no.
okay.
man! did you see the kid on that nose?
uh-huh. (ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) y’know what i was, i was thinking about?
huh?
umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. that was some-something huh?
yeah. yeah, it really was. but we…we got to be careful. we…we can not let that happen again, y’know?
(pause) right.
i mean we do not want to go down that road do we?
no! no, of course not. no. that is why i brought it up. (pause) they did not have any sodas?
oh my god! I am sorry, i was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
that is all right. (he goes to get her a soda.) and so it begins.
is she in there?
yeah. she is putting her down now, that is her. (points to the nurse putting emma now.)
oh!
look at emma!
i just can not decide who she looks more alike, you or rachel?
oh what are you kidding? she is gorgeous, it is all rachel.
I am sorry, for the last time, why are not you two together again? (silence from ross.) no, i know. i know, because you are not in that place. which would be fine, except you totally are.
it is…it is complicated okay?
yeah that is true. yeah, you love her. you always have. you have a child together. there is no right answer.
look, we have been together. okay? and then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. (pause) it is just if-if we got together again and it did not work out…i could never do that to emma. i mean she-she thinking everything—(starts to cry.) oh that is…now me. what do they put something in the water in this place? since rachel and i we are doing really, we are doing really well right now.
i know. i know. i know. i know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
yeah, exactly.
right. (pause) or you might get everything you have wanted since you were fifteen.
hey. i just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. (notices she is wiping her eyes.) what is the matter?
nothing.
what is it? hey!
really it is nothing. I am just…
rach come on, what?
I have just been thinking about how my baby and i are going to be all alone.
what are you talking about alone? what about ross?
oh please, he will be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
okay, how long was i watching that woman?
I am just saying that y’know, someday ross is going to meet somebody and…he is going to have his own life. right?
yeah, i guess so.
i just never thought i would raise this baby all by myself. pretty dumb huh?
hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever going to be alone. okay? i promise that is not going to happen.
joey. honey what would i do without you?
you do not have to worry about that okay?
oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? they are right on that chair under ross’s coat.
sure.
okay.
my god.
joey.
(seeing the ring) oh my god. (pause) okay.
(she enters) hey...
hi!
pheebs, what is wrong?
oh, I am just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) huge engagement ring!
my god!
hey!
congratulations! wow!!
so, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) yeah, big surprise, i like proposals!
well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.
well, hey! well... (he takes his mug to toast phoebe) here is to phoebe, who is found the greatest guy in the world! to phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) i want to say mike? (pause) to phoebe and mike!
thank you! (to rachel) oh, and i have something for you!
mmh-mmh!
it is, yes, my little black book. it is got the numbers of all the guys I have dated.
oh, pheebs, baby, that is nice but, you know what, i think I am ok. why do not you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
i would, but you are the last one.
(angrily) give me the book! (she takes it and start reading) pablo diaz, brady smith, huh, "guy-in-van"?
oh, my first love!
oh!
what does the red x next to bob greenmore's name mean?
dead. (everyone is a bit upset) oh, it is ok, no, he was old, yeah! and he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at omaha beach.
hey, I am sorry, i should have given you guys my black book when i got married! although it was not so much a book as a... napkin. with janice's phone number on it.
phoebe, is not jethro tull a band?
(proud of herself) oh yes, they are.
(he enters) hey honey!
(looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. then he closes the door, and we see it is joey.) hi sweetie!
is monica not here?
no.
oh, then I will tell you. my agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! it is my first national commercial!
cool!
yeah, and i do not want to brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) hell, you were not there? all the ideas were mine!!!
that is great! hey, can you cast me in it?
oh... i do not know, i really do not think you are right for the part.
what do you mean? i can do anything, I am a chameleon! huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I am old! (then he yawns) I am tired! (then he mimes someone who is hot...) hey, I am hot (...and cold) I am cold!! huh?? come on! what can not i do?
first of all. bravo. uh, but i really do not think you are right for this. the part calls for a stuffy college professor.
i can do that! (in a deeper voice) "hello, I am your professor. when I am not busy thinking of important things or... professing. i like to use..." oh, what is the product?
software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
(after a long pause he starts miming again) I am cold!
(to charlie) hey!
guess who is a finalist for a huge research grant! I will give you a hint, he is looking right at you.
oh, I am so excited, i mean, apparently i beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys i went to graduate school with. not that I am keeping score or anything... five!
well, ok, it is for 25 thousand dollars. and if i get it, I will finally be able to complete my field research! and there will be an article about me in the "paleontology review"! yeah! that will be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!
yeah. why?
your ex-boyfriend?
so, your ex-boyfriend is going to determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!
well, if you think it would help.
ok, now, is there anything i can do to... you know, butter him up? anything he really likes?
we will see how dinner goes.
(looking at monica entering) hey!
hey, you want to go to see a movie?
well, i told you i had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so mike could move in.
oh, right.
yeah.
oh, well. now that I am here i might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! just happen to have my label maker!
oh, it is so hard to get rid of stuff! did you and chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
uh, chandler did! what does he want you to give up?
a bunch of stuff. and the worst one... he wants me to get rid of gladys.
who is gladys? (phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. monica's frightened and she gasps.) oh! what a tragic loss!
yeah. i really hate to give her up. oh, i know!! oh, you should take her!
(faking happiness) well, i-i-i-i... i do not know...
why, you do not like her?
well, of course i do. what is not to like! I will take her in a minute! but, you know, i think that you are giving up too easy, honey. i think that you need to fight for her!
really? you think?
absolutely! yes, you say to him "I am sorry mike i can not live without her, she means too much to me!"
ok, I will fight for her. ok! oh, wait, oh i just realized... if i do that, that means you do not get her.
damn it, i did not think this through!
hey you guys.
hi!
oh! any word on casting yet?
joe, i told you, you are just not right for the part.
what do you mean? rach, do not i seem like a professor you would buy some kind of e-crap from?
I am sorry, this sounds like something I am never going to be interested in.
joe...
just watch it, and if you do not like it, you do not pass it on to your bosses!
fine!
thank you. (he sits down)
work, joe!
damn it! (he leaves)
just pass it to your boss!
he is not right for the part. so if i suggest him, my bosses are going to think I am an idiot! and that is something they should learn on their own!
just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses did not. then that way, you are the good guy and they are the bad guys.
that is good! i liked it, they did not. (he sees joey out of the window hitting on a girl) joey, for god's sake, go to work! (joey runs away).
i can not believe I am about to meet benjamin hobart. I have always thought of him as one of the people I would invite to my fantasy dinner party. do you think there is any chance he will bring christie brinkley or c3po?
well, i... i am having a good hair day.
I am ok.
it is an honor to meet you. i can not tell you how long I have been an admirer of your work, i mean, that nobel prize, (he thumbs up) whoooo! i mean, i have to tell you that, you are one of the reasons i got into the field.
no, but, it is, you know, it is just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, mmm.
ok well, i would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
see, there are still several areas that have not been fully excavated.
what?
did you just say "break up with charlie"?
kind of inappropriate, do not you think?
are you serious?
no!
hi! sorry, I am late.
hey, how did it go with mike, is he going to let you keep the painting?
no, he really hates it. but he is going to let me keep my box of human hair! so you got to pick your battles. but the good news is, gladys is yours!
wow, what is the bad news!
who is gladys?
oh, she is that work of art i made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
(sarcastic) oh, and monica gets to keep her? in her house? i am so jealous!
oh, i did not know you wanted her too!
huh!
well, i mean, sure, of course. but... you already gave that to monica, so...
you know, i would give her up, for you.
no, i could not let you do that.
but i want to.
but i do not want you to.
but i insist!
but i insist harder!
girls, girls, stop, ok? we will flip a coin. heads, she is rachel's, tails she is monica's. (she flips the coin). tails! monica, she is yours!
no, that landed in your food!
(sarcastic) no, no, that is ok. you won fair and square. I am so sad!
hey joe!
what is up?
bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they were not interested.
(sounds disappointed) oh.
(hands the tape back to him) I am sorry man.
(looks at him suspiciously) but, ehm... you watched the tape?
(sounds nervous) yeah! i... i... i liked it! (joey continues to look at him suspiciously) but, ehm... my bosses did not go for it. stupid sons of bitches!
(sounds confident) you did not watch the tape.
(looks surprised) what!? of course i did!
look, it is one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
I am not lying to you, i watched it!
well, you lied again! (rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)
i watched it!
keep going pinocchio!
(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) i did!
(yelling back) no you did not! (turns and goes towards his room)
(following him) I am telling you, i watched the tape. (reaches joey's room and joey slams the door in his face)
did you watch the tape?
in a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone) no!
(rolls his eyes) i guess!
(shocked and confused by the question) what? i... i... (benjamin looks at him as if to say "what is wrong? answer the question")
(annoyed) may 12th?
(even more shocked) wha..? i need 6 graduate students.
wha...? wait, wait, wait, just a minute. none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology.
(annoyed) um... I have never heard of a "boscodictiasaur".
(stares at him angrily) ok. (determined to spell it correctly) b - of - s ...
oh come on!!
i can not believe joey. i hate being called a liar!
but you are a liar.
what did i just say?
you still here?
yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am insulted. when i tell somebody i did something...
ok whoah-hey... let me just stop you right there, ok? first, you lied, right? then, you lied about lying, ok? then you lied about lying about lying, ok? so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) stop lying!
why are you so sure i did not watch this tape?
(very angry) you want to know wh...? you want to know why? (goes back into his room)
well, this is going well. (chandler looks worried)
(comes out holding the tape) here is how i know you did not watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) if you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. alright, now remember, i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan. (presses play and he appears on the tv screen and a tv commercial begins)
(yelling at chandler) and that is how i know you did not watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).
he really is a chameleon.
(smiling from ear to ear) well, gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')
(faking happiness) oh, my!
(surprised by how ugly it is) wow! (sarcastic) oh, she is so nice and big! oh, monica, where are you going to display gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)
(sounds desperate, knowing what rachel is trying to do) i have not really settled on a spot yet!
well, hey! how about right above the tv? (points to the spot where her famous french poster is hanging). that way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
(genuinely excited about it) yeah, yeah! and you can get rid of that french poster.
(offended) i like that poster!
really? it does not have anything coming out of it. or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
(jumps at the chance to make that happen) oh! there is nothing above your bed!!
(impatient with rachel) are you still here?
oh hi! hello! uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (now yelling) aunt margaret's pants size?
(sarcastic) no! stop!
(skeptical) really?
i have to break up with charlie?
you are crazy.
crazy!
(yelling) get out! (benjamin leaves)
of-oh my god!
(enters from his bedroom) what?
joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?
i got it from monica. she sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
joey, we are not keeping this!
but it is an original buffay...
alright, fine. you can keep it. as long as you do not mind that she is haunted.
hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
well, legend has it joey, that... she comes alive when you are asleep.
she climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) and then with her one good hand, she slo-of-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
get that legless witch out of here!
hey! i sold that to joey.
well, why i told him it is haunted. two can play at this game. (gives gladys to monica)
no, too late. you can not give it back! (she pushes the painting back to rachel)
yes i can! (pushes her back again)
no you can not. she is yours!
she is yours!
she is yours!
she is yours!
hey! (there is a pause)
she is mine!
she is m-i-i-ne!
she is mine!
she is mine!
you guys! you guys! you do not have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. one of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) whoever does not get gladys gets glynnis. (rachel and monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)
i want gladys!
she is mine!
she is mine!
she is mine!
she is mine!
look, I am sorry i did not give them your tape. and i promise, next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not.
that is not the point chandler. the point is that you lied.
i know. you are right. what is it going to take for you to forgive me?
oh my god!
excellent!
now, what do you say?
lying is wrong!
and?... and?
I am a pretty little girl.
i knew it!
your ex-boyfriend is insane.
no i did not, and you want to know why? because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
yeah. he would not give me the grant, because i would not give you up.
really? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "underdog"?
if you do not believe me, let us go talk to him, okay? I am telling you, he did not ask me one paleontological question.
oh, I am sorry, no. he did ask me one. uhm... how do you spell mboscodictiosaur?
damnit!
i want you to tell her everything. about the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... wally cox! that is the voice of underdog!
no, no, no. do not do that! i want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
too little, too late, benji!
(indignant) no!
what?
or...
sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
okay, that is it. we are seeing other people!
gladys?
ha ha ha, third time this week. man, this does not get old.
you are mean!
oh, do not be such a baby!
so i told carl, ‘nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ but of course this went in one ear and out.....
i love how he cares so much about stuff. if i squint i can pretend he is alan alda.
oh good, another dinosaur story. when are those going to become extinct?
if i was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
who is singing?
hey. when you guys were kids and you played happy days, who were you? i was always richie.
i was always joanne.
question. was ah, ‘egg the gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?
ewww! oh! it is the mattress king!
booo!!
(to janice) do not look honey. change the channel! change the channel!
what a wank!
i know! and four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) and I am appalled for you by the way.
‘okay. (listens) okay, daddy we will see you tomorrow night. (listens) okay bye-bye.’ (hangs up)
we?
are ah, having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, i hope that is okay.
oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I am supposed to um, fall off the empire state building and land on a bicycle with no seat. sorry.
ross, my father does not hate you.
please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.
but honey he calls everybody by a nickname! okay, look, i know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. i just want him to love you like i do. (ross looks at her) all right, well not exactly like i do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I will love you like i do in that black thing that you like.
(leaning in) I will go.
fine.
thank you.
hi gunther.
(entering) hey, you guys!
hey!
guess what?
what?
i got a gig!
see, that is why i could never be an actor. because i can not say gig.
yeah, i can not say croissant. (realises) oh my god!
what is the part?
well, it is not a part, no. I am teaching acting for soap operas down at the learning extension.
come on! that is great.
yeah, yeah. it is like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
(glares at him) i know!
ugh! i do not know monica. it feels funny just being here. i mean if you buy a bed from janice’s ex-husband, that is like betraying chandler.
not at these prices.
(sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) hi. y'know in england this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the ‘that went right over your head’ motion) woo!
(lying down on a mattress) oh! ohhhhh! oh! phoebe, come here. aw, this is my new bed. you got to feel this bad boy.
eh, monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, chandler’s your friend... (hops onto the bed) oh! oh my god! aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
good evening. I am mr. tribbiani. and i will be teaching acting for soap operas. now um, on my first day as (proudly) dr. drake remoray on days of our lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you do not have a line, but someone else just did. and it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) thanks, thanks, a lot. oh, by the way, before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. all right, moving right along.
hi!
hey! ooh! how was teaching last night?
oh it was great. yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’hey, the bell does not dismiss you, i dismiss you.’
ooooh, nice.
oh, and guess what, i got an audition for all my children.
oh, yay!
yeah, it is this great part, this boxer named nick. and I am so, so right for it, y'know, he is just like me. except he is a boxer, and has an evil twin.
oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)
okay.
oh, do i have a middle name. all right monica velula geller. it is that bedroom there. (points to monica’s room)
hey, monica bought a bed from the mattress king?
yeah, so please, please, please, do not say anything to chandler.
you want me to lie to chandler?
is that a problem?
no.
oh, hey, hey nick the boxer let us see what you got. all right ya, put ‘them up. come on. (they start shadow boxing)
hey, you are ah, pretty good at this.
yeah, well i had to learn, i was staying at the y and some off the young men were not acting christian enough.
ahh!
hey now!
hey!!! oww!! and I am bleeding.
oh! oh! oh!
okay, great.
wow! and I am a vegetarian! all right, all right, well I am sorry, we will put some ice on it.
okay.
‘kay, put your head back.
all right. i can not see.
all right, i have ya. oh god.
oh, it is the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
hi daddy!
you remember ross.
nice to see you again dr. green.
ugh, museum.
there never was a library. i mean there are libraries, its just that i ah, i never worked at one.
yeah, if you are really hungry. (dr. green stares at him) it was a joke, i made a joke.
yeah, actually daddy ross is allergic to lobster.
it is not a library...
so, dr. green, how is the old boat.
it gives it a nice antiquey look.
wow. I am sorry, when i was a kid i lost a bike to that. (rachel giggles at that)
okay.
okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
aw honey stop! it is not that bad.
yeah. (sees the bill) op! uh-oh! i think your dad must have added wrong. he only tipped like four percent.
yeah. that is daddy.
that is daddy?! but does not it bother you? you are a waitress.
yes, it bothers me ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I would be serving him sneezers.
so?
so. ross, I have bugged him about this a million times, he is not going to change.
you really serve people sneezers?
well um, i do not.
thanks again, dr. green.
oh, ah, you do not need that.
the carbon, it is messy, i mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
oh, yeah, that would be me, um, i have, i have a problem i-i tip way too much, way, way, too much, it is a sickness really.
yeah it is, it is. (to ross) we really, really have to do something about that.
i know.
oh daddy, no he did not mean anything by that, he really did not.
nothing i do means anything, really.
well mr. big shot is better than ‘wethead’.
okay, some tricks of the trade. now, I have never been able to cry as an actor, so if I am in a scene where i have to cry, i cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. or ah, or, let us say i want to convey that I have just done something evil. that would be the basic ‘i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it’ (does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) okay, let us say I have just gotten bad news, well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) and that is how it is done. great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
hey-hey.
awww, one of my students got an audition. I am so proud.
you bet! what is the part?
you had to do it, did not you? you could not just leave it alone.
four percent. okay. i tip more than that when there is a bug in my food.
ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. (ross groans and rubs his neck) oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
yeah, I am going to go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
hey pheebs, what are you doing?
I am, I am freaking out! monica kind of trusted me with something and she should not have! all right, i have not lived here in a while, so i have to ask you something. does monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
um. yeah.
i am soo dead. (goes to monica’s room)
all right, look, here is the bottom line ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. so, I will invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
look, honey, i have tried to make nice, it does not work.
okay, look, ross, i realise that my father is difficult, but that is why you have got to be the bigger man here.
look sweetie, i could be the bigger man, i could be the biggest man, i could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still would not make any difference, except that i could pick your father up and say ‘like me! like me tiny doctor!’
okay, well can not you just try it one more time ross? for me? for me?
rachel one brunch is not going to solve anything. you got to face it, okay we are never going to get along.
okay, well you are just going to have too, okay. because i already got a mother and a father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, i do not want to have to have a separate room for you too!! (starts to cry)
okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I will get the bagels.
(sees the bed) what is this?
is not it cool! varoom! varoom!
this is not the bed i ordered!
i know, you must have won like a contest or something!
phoebe!
why is this car in my bedroom?
I am sorry, okay, i-i was not looking, and the store says that they will not take it back because you signed for it...
when did i sign for it?
when i was you! y'know what, it is all joey’s fault, ‘because he left his nose open!
did you make brownies today?
knock, knock.
(to phoebe) quick, take off your dress, he will not notice the bed.
hey, I am going for sushi does anybody want.. (enters and sees the bed) whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
it is monica’s bed. what?
okay. (to monica) it is a racecar.
so. this has always been monica’s bed, what you are just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
okay, well it this bed is not new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
sometimes i have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.)
wow! that was good. that was...(points to his pocket) tweezers?
whoa. that was really good.
you told him to play the boxer gay!!
well, i-i might have said supergay.
you totally screwed him over.
joey, you are this guy’s teacher. i mean how could you do this?
because, monica, the guy’s so good, and i really, really want this part.
well, if you really, really want it, then it is okay.
(opening the door) hi daddy.
dr. green. how are you? (offers his hand, and dr. green puts his scarf on it.)
thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
(to rachel) okay, that is it, i can not take it anymore.
what? what? he is interested in you. he-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.
oh, please. sweetie it is hopeless, okay, I am just going to go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)
what?!
look, look I am sorry. it is just that....
he is got this thing. and i keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
thank you! that is what i keep saying.
excuse me, dr. bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
uh.
well that is his last name.
and his first name.
it is robert bobby.
and um, excuse me, he helps me.
oh-ho please. ask her how?
with my alignment. I have got one leg shorter than the other.
argue with that.
what? it is true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
i know that!
I am sorry, let her?
what can i do, she does not listen to me about renter’s insurance either.
no.
hey, would you ah, would you like some juice?
okay. (to rachel) wow! this is going so well. did you see us? did you see?
yeah honey, I am standing right there! why did not you just tell him about the mole i have not got checked yet.
excellent!
(sadly) there will come a time in each of your careers when you will have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. i had such an opportunity in the recent, present. and I am ashamed to say that i took it, i advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. and now, he is got a two year contract opposite susan luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I am stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv. I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) thank you.
yeah, i talked to you on the phone, I am the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
all right, jester man, look we want to see the king.
oh-ho-kay, I am talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)
varrrrrroom! hey! watch it lady! varrrrrrrrrrom! (makes a screeching sound as he pretends to stomp on the brakes.) hey-hey good lookin’! (honks the bed’s little horn on the steering wheel.) varrrrrrrrroom. (notices rachel and stops) all right, I will leave. my bed’s so boring.
(answering phone) hello.
(on phone) hey, it is me. i know you can not stand to be in the same room as me, so i just thought I would try and apologize over the phone. all i… (joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
(answering phone) hello.
look i never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I am… (joey hangs up the phone again.)
(answering phone) stop callin’!!
all right!
(entering) aww, turkey! aww, giving thanks! aww!
look everyone, it is the spirit of thanksgiving!
so are things with you and joey any better?
they could not be worse. i spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
oh wow, eight hours? so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
you should not.
speaking of christmas, umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret santa, and then we each only buy one gift. and-and there is the added mystery of who gets who.
who gets whom. (they all look at him.) i do not know why i do that.
well, I am going to take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
we have not eaten yet!
i know, but all that work you are doing to get it ready, i just… (goes into her bedroom.)
hey, by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa, ‘because i want to trade for her.
i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh!
wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it is like impossible to get her something she likes. come on, let us trade!
oh that is not true! that is not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it… (notices the look on monica and phoebe’s faces.) oh, there was no big dog. all right this sucks! i already got her this briefcase, and i had r.g. put on it… (phoebe looks confused.) her initials…
ohh.
well, maybe you could give to somebody else. ooh, like ross geller.
op, y'know what though, it is kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
who cares? he works in a museum!
hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start!
you do not have to do that, ross and joey are not here, you can watch the parade if you want.
thanks.
what is wrong with this freezer?! (she jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) ow! ow!!
god, what happened?!
oh my god, ice just got in my eye!
(standing in her doorway) people are trying to sleep in here!
monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
open it up, let me see.
oh, y’know what, i can not, it really kills.
well maybe you should put some ice on it.
ooh, god it looks bad.
honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
no, my eye doctor is richard! i can not go to him when i do not have a boyfriend!
he is really picky about his patients.
honey, you have got to go. what is his office number?
like i remember his office number! (pause) speed dial 7.
(on phone) hi! yeah, I am calling on behalf of monica geller’s eye, and is um, is richard burke in today. (listens) (to monica) he is out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
yes!!
yes! she is very excited about that.
this is so cool, ‘til monica gets back, it is like I am head chef and i get to make all the decisions. (she looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)
hey-hey, i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
okay, get out of my kitchen!
(entering) all right! okay! i think i am making some progress with joey, when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (ross is pleased.) i mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
all right i… i got to call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
so listen ah, i picked monica for secret santa, but I am already getting her something for chanukah, i was wondering if you want to switch.
oh y’know what, i was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
really?! wow! that is-that is so nice, what are you going to get me?
i do not know r.g., i was thinking something girlie for your office.
yeah, well maybe phoebe will switch with me.
oh no-no-no, you do not want to do that, then you are going to get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
oh, that is not true! I have got her lots of stuff she never took back.
like?
like uh, that gold necklace i got her last year.
when was the last time you saw her wear it?
well, she wore it all christmas day, and then uh…
big dog?
(entering) hey!
hey!
what are you doing?
I am sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt.
everything? even the tv?
no! I am putting that in my room.
listen, joey, i know what he did was wrong but do not you think you could at least hear the guy out?
back when you and rachel were together, if chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
that is a good point. so uh, how long are you going to punish him?
five years.
you have sentenced him?!
hey! do not do the crime if you can not do the time.
joey, the guy’s your best friend.
no, was my best friend. anyway, i do not know why you are pushing for him so hard. with him out of the way as my best friend, there is a spot open.
oh, who? me?
yeah!
wow! I am honored! and y’know what I am going to do as my first act as your best friend?
what?
I am going to get you to talk to chandler.
all right. but if you were not my best friend.
i walk into a room and he will not even talk to me, he just mumbles something in italian. and i know he only knows the bad words.
(entering) hey gunther, have you uh, have you seen chandler?
hey joe.
(something in italian.) (storms out.)
oh my god! how cute is the on-call doctor?
ooh, so cute, that I am thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
oh no-no-no, not dr. burke. dr. burke is out of town. the-the on-call doctor will see me now.
hey! I am sorry! that—(sees that joey is about to leave) where are you going?
my folks.
oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
i do not know. i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment.
what?!
yeah, y’know at first i thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together i do not think i…
hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say that I will stop seeing her?
look, it is not about her. okay? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. and i do not want to live with some one who does not know what it is to be a friend. so, I will see ya. (he starts to leave, but chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)
hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend, i just-i just screwed up!
yeah! you did! and that is why I am leaving.
all right look, if you are not going to stay for me, then at least stay for them! okay, they have had a very difficult year! what with the robbery and all!
when that guy was robbing us, and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what i was doing in there all that time? i was thinking about how i let you down!
what?
yeah! but if would have know what kind of friend you were going to turn out to be, i would not have worried about it so much! see you around!
all right, wait! come on! just wait one second! there has to be something that i can do! something! if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down. (joey looks intrigued) what?
we have got a box. (motions to a large wooden box next to him.)
i was probably waiting for it to open.
you look great too.
so how does it look?
like a pirate?!
umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (he looks at her) come on, one of us had to mention him.
oh. big family dinner tonight?
no way!
(disappointed) oh.
(happy) oh.
(sympathetic) oh. (in a pirate’s voice) so you made her walk the plank? aye, matie?
i know.
he is coming here for thanksgiving!
i know, it is sick.
why is it sick?
because it is richard’s son! it is like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner!
hey, come on, phoebe, you understand do not you?
yeah, i can see where I would be your best shot but, no. I am sorry, but i think it is twisted.
yeah.
(coming out of the bathroom) what is twisted?
me going out with richard’s son.
ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew!
(he is now in the box, in their living room.) sounds like a really bad idea to me.
is he okay in there?
he is fine!
hey, y'know, mon, if things wrong out between you and richard’s son, you would be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
fine! judge all you want to but, (points to ross) married a lesbian, (points to rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to chandler) livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)
so now, what exactly is the point of the box?
chandler?
the meaning of the box is three fold. one (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what i did. two (holds up another finger), it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey. and three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!
(to rachel) oh hey! hey uh, you remember the necklace i gave you last year? can i see it?
(worried) why?
i just want to check something.
okay. (she goes into her bedroom)
(he puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to chandler) now, we will see.
air hole! air hole!! (ross retracts his hand quickly.)
(coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) here it is! i love it. i wear it all the time.
(grabbing the necklace) the necklace i got you was gold, this one is silver.
huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
oh my god! you actually exchanged it!
well is not it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of?
what did you get?
credit.
(running in from her bedroom) I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! I will get it! (opens the door) hi, tim.
thank you. come meet my friends. this is uh, phoebe.
and joey.
hey!
my brother, ross.
hey.
and rachel. (chandler clears his voice loudly) and that is chandler.
how do ya do.
umm, well, he is…
he is doing some thinkin’!
what happened? what happened?!
you kissed my girlfriend!
ooh, i like those sunglasses.
like ‘them, like ‘them? or, I would like to get store credit for that amount like ‘them?
(swears in italian, it is the same term used by joey earlier and joey nods his approval.)
all right everybody, this turkey is ready!
here, let me show you. okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
fancy soap? i thought we were savin’ that for the pope!
see he is nice. right?
yeah, but monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "that is not how your dad used to do it."
i saved you a seat. (motions to the one next to her.)
(pouring the wine) sick-sick-sick-sick.
oh, I will get it. (goes over to the door.)
gotcha! (laughs)
that does not sound like thinking to me!
sorry!
y’know i do not think you should be talking at all in there! i think you have got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
okay, okay, you got it!
ross, can you pass me the yams?
sure! oh, and joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
would you stop?! what is the matter with you?!
oh-ho-ho, we have got company.
there is nothing the matter with me. see, I am not completely devoid of sentiment, see i have feelings.
okay, fine. (she gets up and walks into her bedroom)
you can not tell, but I am trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
all right, look! if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! this means something to me! and if it does not mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you are just an idiot in a box!
you are right, and I am sorry! this means a lot to me! i want you to be my friend again! i swear, i will not say another word tonight.
so are you going to start taking this thing seriously?
absolutely!
that sounds like another word to me! are you going to take this seriously? (there is no response from chandler.) okay.
do not say that i have no sentiment! (starts to show ross what is in the box.) this is a movie stub from our first date! this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (holds up a bone) this is from the museum from the first time we… were together. okay, maybe i exchange gifts sometimes, but i keep the things that matter!
i do not know what to say, I am sorry. though, you are not supposed to take these. (points to the bone) it is like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
(putting off her coat) ooh, this always happens. (her coat gets stuck.)
thank you.
y’know all my friends think this is weird.
i know! i mean it is like me and your dad, that is a totally separate thing.
we are just two people who find each other very attractive. right?
nothing. nothing.
no-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…
(interrupting) do not say it!
yeah!
i know!
I will get it. (it is kathy.)
hey.
that is okay. chandler’s the one I am mad at.
in the box.
oh, he-he can not talk right now.
he is just trying to show joey how much he means to him.
joey, had reasons.
they were threefold.
(starting to cry) open the box!! (runs over to do so.)
what?!
he can still catch her! come on, get out of there! (he opens the box) get out of there!
so?
yeah, we are going to be fine! get out!
yeah?
yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.
man, this is…
now go! ‘because you can still catch her! and merry christmas from you are secret santa! (chandler runs out and closes the door.)
all right, who got chandler? ‘because i uh, need to trade.
oh, he sees her!
oh, he is catching up to her!
oh, she sees him! oh, they are hugging!
he is taking her purse!
uhh, that is not them. I am going to go call the police.
oh, there they are!
all right, get a room.
